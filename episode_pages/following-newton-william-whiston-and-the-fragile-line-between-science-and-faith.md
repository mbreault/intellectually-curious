## Description

Join us as we trace William Whistonâ€™s path from Cambridge prodigy to Newtonâ€™s successor as Lucasian Professor. We explore his bold blend of mathematics and theology, his millennial prophecies, and his controversial ideas about the Bible and the Trinity. From collaborating with peers and mentoring future scientists to clashing with Newton over editing and prophecyâ€”and ultimately his expulsion from Cambridgeâ€”Whistonâ€™s life reveals the volatile crossroads of science, religion, and authority in early 18thâ€‘century Britain.

## Transcript

Welcome back to another deep dive into the fascinating history of the Lucasian Professors of Mathematics at Cambridge. You know, it's practically a roll call of brilliant minds. Oh, absolutely. We just wrapped up exploring the work of Isaac Newton, a true giant of science. Huge. But today, we're going to meet the man who had to step into those, well, enormous shoes. That's right, William Whiston. William Whiston. It's pretty amazing just thinking about the pressure of taking on that role, you know, following Newton. I can only imagine. But what's so fascinating about Whiston is that he wasn't content to just follow in those footsteps. He carved his own path, really. He did. Pushing boundaries, not only in mathematics, but in theology, too. He even went so far as to predict the end of the world. I mean, predicting the apocalypse. You've got to have some serious confidence to do that, especially when you're following someone like Newton. What was his background? What led him to this point? Well, he was born in 1667 in Leicestershire, England. His father was a rector, so religion was definitely a big part of his upbringing. Makes sense. But even as a kid, Whiston showed a real strong inclination towards intellectual pursuits. And his curiosity eventually led him to Cambridge and to the world of mathematics. So he wasn't just a mathematician, but a theologian as well. Absolutely. A fascinating combination. And you can see these two passions intertwining throughout his life. I can see that. A great example of that, there's this great story about how he initially struggled with Newton's lectures at Cambridge. I'll bet. Those were notoriously complex, even for the brightest students. Oh, yeah. Even for the best. But Whiston, instead of just giving up, he was inspired by a paper by David Gregory and dedicated himself to mastering Newton's Principia Mathematica. Wow. And you know what? This dedication led to a friendship with Newton himself. Oh, wow. That's a great example of how even geniuses need inspiration and mentorship. But I'm guessing having Newton as a mentor comes with its own set of challenges, right? Oh, absolutely. But before we get into all of the complexities of their relationship, let's rewind a little bit. In 1702, after serving as Newton's substitute for a time, Whiston officially took over the Lucasian professorship. Wow. Can you imagine stepping into that role after Newton? Yeah. It must have been such an incredible honor, but also an enormous weight on his shoulders. Absolutely. It must have felt like trying to follow a rock star. I was just thinking that. So how did he handle this massive responsibility? Well, during his time at Cambridge, he collaborated with some other pretty bright minds. Oh, I bet. Like Roger Coates, for instance, who he helped appoint to the Plumian professorship. And together they taught some really influential figures in science, people like Stephen Hales, who made groundbreaking discoveries in plant physiology, and William Stukely, who was a pioneer in archaeology. It's a good reminder that even geniuses don't work in isolation. No. It's all about collaboration. Absolutely. But getting back to this idea of Whiston being both a mathematician and a theologian, how did those two worlds collide for him? Did he see them as separate, or did he try to merge them in some way? That's really a key question when it comes to understanding Whiston. He was what you might call a Newtonian theologian, deeply committed to reconciling science and religion. He even gave those prestigious Boyle Lectures in 1707, which was this platform for Newton's followers to argue against, well, the rise of deism. The idea that God created the universe but then just stepped back and let it run on its own. Right. Whiston firmly believed that the Bible should be taken literally unless there was very strong evidence to the contrary. So this is where you see his deep commitment to both scientific reasoning and religious faith. So he was trying to find a way for science and religion to coexist peacefully, which was, I mean, a pretty big challenge in those days. It was. I could see how that might lead to some pretty interesting and potentially controversial ideas. Oh, absolutely. And one of the most intriguing aspects of Whiston's work is how he tried to connect scientific explanations with biblical prophecies. He even went so far as to explore connections between astronomical events, like comets and eclipses, and events described in the Bible. Wait, comets and the Bible? How did he make that connection? Well, in 1696, he published a book called A New Theory of the Earth, in which he argued that Noah's flood, as described in the Bible, was actually caused by a comet. A comet. A comet. Wow. Now, this might sound a bit surprising, but the book actually received praise from some pretty prominent thinkers, including the philosopher John Locke, who admired Whiston's willingness to, well, think outside the box. That's quite a theory. I mean, a comet causing a worldwide flood? That sounds like something straight out of science fiction. It does sound a little fantastical today. Yeah. But remember, this was a time when the boundaries between science, religion, and philosophy were much more fluid. Whiston's work reflects this intermingling of ideas. But perhaps even more fascinating is how his theories about comets started to impact his relationship with Newton. Okay, so this is where things start to get a little tricky, right? Yes. This is where we see the first cracks in their friendship. Okay. While Whiston was busy explaining comets and the apocalypse, his relationship with Newton began to unravel. And it all came to a head when Whiston published a book in 1706 predicting that the millennium would arrive in 1716. That's a pretty bold prediction. Yeah. I imagine that didn't sit well with Newton, who was all about rational thought and scientific observation. Yeah, you're exactly right. Newton, while deeply religious in his own way, was very cautious about mixing science and prophecies. He probably saw Whiston's millennial prediction as speculative and even damaging to the credibility of their scientific work. Right. So the mentor-student relationship started to break down because of these differing views on religion and science. Did that tension spill over into their academic work as well? Oh, it most certainly did. Things really went downhill when Whiston edited Newton's Arithmetica Universalis. Oh, boy. Newton was incredibly meticulous about his work. Of course. And he wasn't exactly thrilled with the changes that Whiston made. I can imagine. He ended up heavily revising the book himself for a later edition. Ouch. That must have stung a bit. It sounds like their academic collaboration went from inspiring to downright icy. It definitely created this significant rift between them. Right. Whiston saw himself as a loyal follower of Newton, carrying the torch of his ideas. Right. But Newton was fiercely independent. He didn't appreciate having his work reinterpreted, even by someone he had mentored. That makes sense. And this clash of personalities combined with their diverging intellectual paths ultimately led to a complete breakdown of their relationship. So Whiston started his career with the incredible advantage of working alongside one of the greatest scientific minds in history. But their relationship ultimately crumbled under the weight of his own bold and, some might say, unorthodox ideas. Exactly. And if you think a little tension with Newton was bad, you won't believe what happens next. What happens next? This clash over scientific and religious ideas was just the beginning of a much larger controversy that ultimately led to Whiston's expulsion from Cambridge. Expelled? Wow, that sounds serious. What could have possibly led to that? This is where things start to get really interesting, isn't it? Well, it all started with Whiston questioning one of the most fundamental doctrines of Christianity, the Trinity. He started immersing himself in these writings of theologians who challenged the traditional view, people like Samuel Clarke, Louis-Ã‰lise Dupin, and Richard Brockelsby. And through his research, particularly his study of the Apostolic Constitutions, an early Christian text, Whiston became convinced that Arianism was the true belief of the early Church. Okay, so for those of us who aren't theology scholars, what exactly is Arianism? And why was it such a big deal back then? It was a huge deal. Arianism essentially proposed this different hierarchy within the Trinity. So instead of seeing God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit as completely equal, Arians believed that Jesus was, well, subordinate to God the Father. Okay. And this directly challenged the orthodox teachings of the Church of England at the time. Right. And, you know, challenging those doctrines was not something you did lightly in the 18th century. So imagine you're in Whiston's shoes. You're already walking a tightrope. You've ruffled some feathers with your comet theories. Right. You have this, well, not so great relationship with Newton. Right. And then you decide to publicly question one of the core beliefs of the Church. That's some serious courage. Or some might say recklessness. What's so intriguing about Whiston is that he wasn't just, you know, playing devil's advocate. Yeah. He genuinely believed that he'd uncovered this historical truth that had been suppressed by the Church. And that conviction fueled his willingness to risk his reputation and his career to share what he believed was the true faith. Makes you wonder what was going through his mind at the time. Did he realize the potential consequences of his actions? Oh, he must have known he was stepping into some dangerous territory. Yeah. But his commitment to truth, as he saw it, seemed to outweigh any fear of repercussion. And those repercussions weren't long in coming, were they?
