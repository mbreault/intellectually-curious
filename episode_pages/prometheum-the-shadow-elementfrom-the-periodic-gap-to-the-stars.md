## Description

A deep dive into Prometheum, the elusive element predicted by a gap in the periodic table. We trace its winding discoveryâ€”from early misidentifications and the isobar rule to the Manhattan Projectâ€”and explore its unstable isotopes, how we detect its spectral fingerprints in stars, and the practical possibilities of Prometheum-147.

## Transcript

Hey everyone and welcome back for another deep dive. Today we are diving deep into a pretty interesting element. One you might not be familiar with. It's Prometheum. Prometheum. Yeah. You know like I said I don't think a lot of people can be like oh yeah Prometheum. That's on the tip of my tongue. Yeah. No it's definitely not an element you just bump into walking down the street. Right. Prometheum is a synthetic element. It's one of the rare earth elements and the thing about it is that it's not naturally found on earth. At least not in any significant amount. Okay so right off the bat we're talking about something that's not like yeah we can't just dig it up out of the ground or anything like that. Exactly. And that makes its discovery story even more interesting. Oh I bet. So how did scientists even know to look for this stuff in the first place? Well it actually starts back in 1902 with a Czech chemist named Bohuslav Brauner. Now Brauner was studying those lanthanide elements. You know that row that's usually kind of tucked away at the bottom of the periodic table? Yeah like almost like an afterthought almost. Yeah right. But Brauner was really into them and as he was looking at their properties he noticed something strange. There was a gap between neodymium and samarium. They just didn't quite fit based on their atomic numbers and other characteristics. So it's like the periodic table had a missing tooth. Yeah exactly. And based on this gap Brauner predicted that there should be an element there. An element that we now know as Prometheum. Wow so they actually had a spot reserved on the periodic table before they even found it. That's incredible. It is. But finding it that was another story altogether. I bet. So it wasn't just a straight shot from hey there's a gap to boom we found it. Oh not at all. There were a lot of twists and turns, false starts, misidentifications. In the 1920s alone there were a couple of claims that scientists had found element 61. They even gave it names like florencium and illinium. So kind of like finding fool's gold. Looks like the real deal but it's not. Exactly. And these early attempts just show how tricky it was to pin down Prometheum. I can imagine. So what was the problem? Why was it so hard to find? Well part of the problem became a little clearer in 1934 when a German physicist named Josef Matocz came up with what we call the isobar rule. Now without getting too technical it basically predicted that Prometheum would be unstable. That it wouldn't have any stable isotopes. Okay so I know isotopes are like variations of an element with different numbers of neutrons. But what does it mean for an isotope to be unstable? And why would that make Prometheum so hard to find? Well think of it this way. Imagine you're trying to build a tower but some of the blocks are wobbly and keep falling apart. That's kind of what happens with unstable isotopes. They're constantly decaying into other elements. So it's like the tower is always in a state of change. So Prometheum was constantly transforming before scientists could really get a handle on it. Exactly. It was like trying to catch a shadow. Always one step ahead. But you know what? This instability is actually the key to how they finally discovered it. Really? That's a twist. It is. But to understand that part of the story we're going to have to jump ahead a bit and delve into the world of nuclear physics. Ooh. Sounds intriguing. I'm ready when you are. So remember how we were talking about Prometheum's isotopes, those wobbly blocks that are constantly decaying? Well you wouldn't believe where scientists finally found it. Inside a nuclear reactor. A nuclear reactor. Hmm. That doesn't sound like the safest place to be hunting for elements. You're not wrong, but this was during World War II and scientists were working on the Manhattan Project, you know, trying to harness the power of the atom and all that. Right. And in 1945 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the same lab that produced plutonium, a team there, Marinsky, Glendening, and Coriel, they were analyzing the byproducts of uranium fission. Okay, hold on. Uranium fission. Can we break that down a bit? Sure. So basically when a uranium atom is hit with neutrons, it can split apart. And that releases a ton of energy. And when it splits, it forms lighter elements. And one of those elements was Prometheum. Bingo. They weren't even looking for it specifically, but there was hidden amongst all the radioactive leftovers. They were able to isolate it and study it using ion exchange chromatography. Ion exchange what now? Yeah, it's a mouthful. But basically it's a technique for separating elements based on their chemical properties. They were able to pull Prometheum out from all that other stuff. That's pretty amazing. So they finally had their Prometheum. But I'm curious, how did they come up with that name? Prometheum. It sounds pretty epic. It is. And the story behind the name is pretty cool, too. It was actually Grace Mary Coriel, Charles Coriel's wife, one of the scientists who discovered it. She suggested the name Prometheum, which was later changed to Prometheum. I like that, a family affair. But why Prometheum? Well, it's a reference to Prometheus, the Greek titan. You know, the one who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity. Right. And I guess fire, kind of like nuclear fission, can be a source of great power, but also, you know, dangerous if not handled carefully. Exactly. The name captures both the wonder and the potential danger of the discovery. For sure. Yeah. So we've got this element named after a titan. It's born in nuclear reactors. We know it's radioactive and unstable. But what does all that mean in terms of its properties? Right. So as we said, all of Prometheum's isotopes are radioactive, meaning they're always decaying into other elements. And when we talk about radioactive decay, we have to talk about half-life, the time it takes for half of a sample to decay into a different element. So if we start with, let's say, 100 grams of Prometheum, after one half-life, we'd have 50 grams left. Right. And different isotopes have different half-lives. Some are short and some are longer. The most stable isotope of Prometheum, Prometheum-147, has a half-life of about 17.7 years. Which is still pretty short in the grand scheme of things. But here's a question. If all of Prometheum's isotopes are unstable, always decaying, how can we even study it or use it for anything? Oh, that's a great question. And it gets to the heart of why Prometheum is so interesting. We can still work with it because we understand how it decays and how it will behave. So it's like knowing a bus route. You may not be able to stop the bus, but you can plan your trip around it. Yeah. Good analogy. Now before we move on to what we can actually do with Prometheum, I have one more thing to clear up. We've been saying that Prometheum isn't naturally found on Earth, at least not in any significant amount. Remember that early claim from 1934 by Willard Libby? He thought he'd found Prometheum in neodymium. Another one of those false starts. Well, not entirely. It turns out that tiny, tiny amounts of Prometheum do exist naturally. Huh. For example, it can form from the decay of Europium-151. But we're talking about such small amounts, parts per quintillion, it's unlikely anyone would have ever found it naturally. So like finding a needle in a haystack, times a million. Pretty much. But here's where things get really wild. Remember those spectral lines we talked about? Those unique fingerprints that elements leave in light. Vaguely. Remind me. Sure. Each element, when it's heated up, emits light at very specific wavelengths. It's like each element has its own signature tune. And we can use these patterns, these spectral lines, to identify elements. Even in stars. It's like cosmic fingerprinting. Exactly. And guess what? We've actually detected Prometheum's spectral signature in stars, like in HR 465 and the Andromeda Galaxy. Wait. So this element that's super rare and unstable here on Earth is just chilling out in stars millions of light years away. Yeah. And the leading theory is that it's being continuously produced in these stars through nuclear processes. Wow. That's mind-blowing. So we've got this element that's barely here on Earth, but it's being created in the hearts of stars across the galaxy. So much for being synthetic. Right. It really makes you think. But that brings us to another question. If Prometheum is so unstable and so hard to come by, is there anything we can actually use it for? Yeah, that's what I was thinking. It seems like it would be more trouble than it's worth. Well, you might be surprised. While not all of Prometheum's isotopes are useful, there's one in particular that has some pretty cool applications. Oh, and which Prometheum all-star is that? Prometheum-147. It's kind of the workhorse of the Prometheum family. It has a decent half-life and it doesn't emit those nasty gamma rays. But before we get into that, what are some of your key takeaways so far about Prometheum? Well, my brain is definitely doing some gymnastics right now. Prometheum, it's like we've
