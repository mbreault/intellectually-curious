## Description

Discover how data can travel through the air with light by diving into photonic integrated circuits (PICs). We break down what PICs are, the materials behind them (indium phosphide, silicon photonics, lithium niobate, silica), and the components that enable high-speed optical linksâ€”lasers, modulators, waveguides, and arrayed waveguide gratings. We trace the fieldâ€™s evolution from early lasers to monolithic tunable lasers and integrated receivers, then examine Taraâ€™s latest chip announcement to understand why this could be a game changer for wireless communications.

## Transcript

Welcome back to Science Corner. You know we love diving deep into some really cool scientific topics. Yeah. And today we're going to be talking about something pretty fascinating. Yeah, definitely. Transmitting data wirelessly using light. Uh-huh. I mean, think Star Trek, right? But real? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. It's like we're moving into the future. Totally. And we're going to be focusing on a really cool development. Okay. The Tara chip. Have you heard about this? Yeah, yeah. I've been keeping an eye on it. It's pretty revolutionary what they're doing over there. It is. And for this deep dive, we've got a couple of great sources we're going to be looking at. Okay. So first up, we've got the Wikipedia entry on photonic integrated circuits. Right, the foundation. Exactly. Got to understand the basics. And then we'll be jumping into Tara's own announcement about their new chip. Sounds good. Sounds good. So the big question is, how do they actually send data through the air using light? And what makes this Tara chip such a big deal? Yeah, well, maybe we should start with, like you said, the PICs, right? Photonic integrated circuits. Yeah, let's break it down. So what they are, essentially, are, it's like, you know how we have electronic integrated circuits in our computers and phones? Like the chips in our devices. Exactly, yeah. So they use electrons to process information. PICs are kind of similar, but instead of electrons, they use photons. Okay, and photons are? Light particles. It's like the fundamental unit of light. So these chips are manipulating light to move information around. Yeah, exactly. And these light waves, they're typically in the visible or near infrared part of the spectrum. So like the light we can see? Some of it, yeah. But also wavelengths that are a bit longer than what our eyes can pick up. Oh, okay. Kind of like the invisible light that your TV remote uses. Huh, interesting. So it's not blasting like a spotlight everywhere then? No, no, it's much more targeted than that. Okay, good to know. And the cool thing about using light is that it allows for super fast data transmission. Okay. And you don't get the same kind of interference that you might encounter with radio waves. Right, because everything's wireless these days, right? Yeah, exactly. The airwaves are getting pretty crowded. So using light is like opening up this whole new highway for data. Exactly, exactly. Got it. So then what are these PICs actually made of? Because I know computer chips are mainly silicon, right? Yeah, that's right. But with PICs, it's a bit more diverse. They use a wider variety of materials. So like what else besides silicon? Well, the Wikipedia article talks about indium phosphide, or ENP, as being really important commercially. MP. Yeah. And what makes it so special is it can both create and control light. On a single chip? Yeah, all on one chip. That's pretty amazing. It is. So you can have these active components like lasers that generate the light, and then passive components like waveguides and modulators that kind of shape and direct the light. So it's like a whole light show happening on this tiny chip. Uh-huh, yeah, I kind of like that. And so early versions of these PICs, they were already using NMP. Yeah, they were making things like two-section distributed Bragg reflector lasers, or DVR lasers. Two-section what? It's a mouthful. But basically these were like simpler types of lasers, but they were kind of the first step in showing that this integrated approach with NMP was really powerful. Gotcha. So from those early lasers, how did things evolve? What do PICs look like today? Well, we have these really sophisticated things called monolithic tunable lasers. Okay. So these lasers can emit light at different wavelengths. It's like having a laser that can change colors. Wow, that's cool. Yeah. And we also have these externally modulated lasers, or EMLs, and integrated receivers, which are super important for high-speed communication. And all of these are built using PIC technology. Exactly. And the Wikipedia article actually mentions that by 2012, researchers were already integrating hundreds of different optical functions onto a single chip. Hundreds? That's incredible. It is. The field's been moving incredibly fast. So stepping back a bit, the whole field of photonics, it's relatively new, right? Like when did this all begin? Well, you could say it really took off with the invention of the laser in the 1960s. Right, that makes sense. Lasers are all about light. Yeah. The laser gave us this really intense, focused source of light. Which I guess was essential for developing all of these optical technologies. Absolutely. Then in the 1980s, we saw the rise of fiber optic communication. Oh yeah, using light to send information through those glass fibers. Exactly. That's basically how the modern internet works. But it's not just about the laser, right? There were other key innovations along the way. Yeah, definitely. I mean, one that stands out is the work of Mint Smith at Delft University of Technology. Okay. He invented something called the arrayed waveguide grating, or AWG. What does that do? It's like a traffic director for light signals. Okay. It can route different wavelengths of light to different destinations. So it's kind of like a switchboard for optical communication. Exactly. That's pretty cool. And it's a fundamental component in a lot of optical systems, from internet infrastructure to, well, even Tara's technology, which we'll get to later. All right, so we've talked about indium phosphide for these PICs. Uh-huh. But the Wikipedia article also mentions silicon. Can you actually use silicon for photonic chips? You can, but it's a bit tricky. Okay, why is that? Well, silicon has what's called an indirect bandgap. An indirect what now? Ha-ha. Yeah, it sounds complicated. But basically what it means is that silicon isn't very good at emitting light. Ah, so it's not like a natural light source. No, not really. It's more like a light bulb that takes a lot of effort to turn on. Got it. So why even bother using silicon if it's not good at making light? Well, silicon has other really useful properties for photonics. Like what? So it turns out that silicon is actually excellent at creating passive photonic circuits. Passive circuits. Yeah, these are components that can guide and manipulate light, but they don't actually generate the light themselves. It's like the roads and infrastructure, but not the cars. Perfect analogy. And silicon is really good for this because it has low losses, meaning the light signal doesn't weaken too much as it travels through the circuit. Okay, that's important. It is. And it's also not very sensitive to changes in temperature, which is a big plus. So it's stable and reliable. Exactly. Plus, and this is a huge advantage, silicon photonics allows you to integrate optical circuits with traditional electronics all on the same chip. Oh, so you can have the light and the electronics working together seamlessly. Yeah, that's the idea. You can have the light doing the fast data transmission and the electronics handling all the control and processing all in one tiny package. So it's like a hybrid approach. It is, yeah. And that co-integration is super powerful for building more complex systems. Right, it makes sense to combine the strengths of both. Absolutely. So we've talked about silicon and indium phosphide. What other materials come into play with these PICs? Well, there's a whole bunch of other interesting materials. Oh, really? Yeah, like lithium niobate, which is great for making modulators. Modulators, what do they do? They basically change the properties of the light signal, like its intensity or phase. Okay. And that's how you encode information onto the light. So it's like turning the light on and off in specific patterns to represent data. That's a good way to think about it, yeah. Okay, cool. And then there's silica on silicon, which also has really low losses for guiding light. And silica is just a type of glass, right? Yeah, that's right. Got it. So is each material used for specific components then? Pretty much, yeah. It's like having a toolbox with all these different specialized tools. Makes sense. And depending on what you're trying to build, you choose the best material for the job. Okay, so building a PIC sounds a lot more complicated than making a regular electronic chip. Yeah, it definitely is. I mean, in electronics, you've basically got the transistors, your main building block. Right. But with photonics, it seems like you need all these different components working together. That's true. You need waveguides to act like tiny optical fibers on the chip, power splitters to divide the light signal, optical amplifiers to boost the signal strength, modulators to encode the data, filters to select specific wavelengths. Wow, it's a lot. It is. And of course, you still need lasers to generate the light and detectors to receive it. So it's like a whole orchestra of components playing together. Uh-huh, I like that analogy. And getting all these different components, which often need different materials and manufacturing processes to play nicely together on a single chip, that's a huge engineering challenge. Yeah, I can imagine. But despite all those complexities, PICs are already playing a really important role in technologies we use every day. Like how? Well, the Wikipedia article mentions fiber optic communication as the main application. Right, because those fiber optic cables use light to transmit data. Exactly. And PICs are crucial for making that technology work efficiently. So they're kind of like the hidden heroes of the internet
