## Transcript

Welcome to a deep dive into the world of mendelevium. Now this isn't an element you're going to stumble upon in your backyard. Mendelevium is a synthetic radioactive element, meaning it's completely made by us humans. And what makes mendelevium truly fascinating is that it represents a sort of a turning point in how we create elements. It's the first one where the usual go-to method, bombarding an element with neutrons, just wouldn't work. Oh wow, so it's like we hit a wall on the periodic table. In a way, yes. Wow. We have some great source material for today's deep dive. Yes. And I'm really curious about how they actually discovered it, given those limitations. So what do we know about mendelevium and why is it so important, even though we can only create minuscule amounts of it? Well, mendelevium gives us a glimpse into the extremes of matter. And studying it can reveal so much about nuclear physics and chemistry. It's a bit like exploring a new continent. You never know what you might find. I love that analogy. Yeah. Let's rewind the clock back to 1955, UC Berkeley. Okay. Our source material talks about the incredible scientific detective work that went into discovering mendelevium. Right. The researchers at Berkeley were already pioneers in synthesizing transuranic elements. Yes. Elements heavier than uranium. Exactly. But with mendelevium, they encountered a unique obstacle. They did. The traditional method of neutron bombardment, which had worked so well for previous elements, ran into a problem with fermium. Right. Specifically, its most stable isotope, fermium-258. Exactly. What was the issue with fermium-258? Did it have something to do with its half-life? Exactly. Fermium-258 has an incredibly short half-life and undergoes spontaneous fission before it can capture another neutron. Essentially, it breaks apart before it can become anything heavier. Oh, I see, I see. Yeah. So how did they overcome that? They couldn't just keep adding neutrons. No, they had to invent a whole new technique. A brilliant method that actually earned them a Nobel Prize. Wow. The recoil technique. Okay. I am definitely intrigued. Yeah. How did this recoil technique actually work? Did it have something to do with alpha particles? They bombarded a target made of einsteinium with alpha particles, which are essentially helium nuclei. And this collision was powerful enough to cause some of the einsteinium atoms to fuse with the alpha particles, creating mendelevium. Wow. The impacts literally kicked the new mendelevium atoms away from the target where they were caught on a special foil. Oh, so instead of adding to the target element, they created a new element entirely. Yes. And the process required incredible speed and precision. Oh, yeah. Because those mendelevium atoms were highly unstable and decayed rapidly. It's mind-blowing that they were able to synthesize mendelevium one atom at a time. One atom at a time. Our sources mention it took three-hour sessions just to produce a few atoms. It's remarkable. It makes you appreciate the dedication and ingenuity of these scientists. Absolutely. The dedication was remarkable. Speaking of remarkable, the story of how it got its name is also quite fascinating. Especially considering the political climate at the time. Right. The height of the Cold War. Right. Naming it after Dmitry Mendeleev, the Russian chemist who created the periodic table, must have been a bold move. It was definitely a significant gesture. Yeah. There were diplomatic considerations and negotiations, but ultimately the scientific community acknowledged Mendeleev's massive contribution to chemistry. Yeah. And the name stuck. It really speaks to the unifying power of science. It does. That transcends political boundaries. Absolutely. And let's not forget the fun fact about its symbol. Oh, yes. It was originally Mendeleev, but was later changed to MDL to avoid confusion with other elements. So we've talked about the discovery and the naming, but what do we actually know about Mendeleevium itself? Right. What do we know? What would it look like if we could see it? That's where things get a bit tricky. Okay. We've never actually been able to produce enough Mendeleevium to see it with the naked eye. Oh, wow. We're talking about working with individual atoms, not grams or kilograms. So no one has ever held a piece of Mendeleevium in their hand? Not yet. Not yet. But that doesn't mean we're completely in the dark. Okay. Based on our understanding of the periodic table and the properties of its neighboring elements, scientists can make pretty accurate predictions about its appearance and behavior. Okay. So what are those predictions? Right. What do they think it would look like? Scientists believe it would be a solid metal at room temperature. Okay. Likely with a silvery-white or grayish color, similar to other actinide metals. Okay. They also estimate a melting point around 800 degrees Celsius. Wow. And a density about 10 times that of water. Wow. So if we could hold it, it would be incredibly dense. Yeah. Very dense. It makes you wonder why it's so difficult to create in larger quantities. Right. Is it just the limitations of our technology, or is there something inherent about Mendeleevium itself? It's a bit of both. Okay. The technology for creating these superheavy elements is constantly evolving, but Mendeleevium itself poses some unique challenges due to the behavior of its electrons. Okay. Now we're getting into the territory I love to explore. Okay. Tell me more about these electrons. Well, as we move further down the periodic table into the realm of heavier elements like Mendeleevium, the electrons start to behave a bit differently. Okay. They experience what's called relativistic stabilization. Relativistic stabilization. Yeah. That sounds intense. It is. Okay. Essentially, because the electrons in heavier atoms are moving so incredibly fast, their mass actually increases. Oh. And this affects how they interact with the atom's nucleus. So it's not just about the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, but also how the electrons are behaving. Exactly. Right. And in the case of Mendeleevium, this relativistic effect leads to it preferring a plus-two oxidation state. This basically means it has two electrons available for bonding. This preference for a plus-two oxidation state has a profound impact on its chemical properties and makes it much more difficult to isolate and study in larger amounts. So it's not just about having the right equipment. Right. Mendeleevium's own nature makes it incredibly elusive. It does. We know it's dense and likely silvery-white or gray. But what about its chemical behavior? Right. Does it react with other elements? Well, most of our understanding of Mendeleevium's chemistry comes from studying it in solution. Okay. Where its reactions are more nuanced than, say, an explosive reaction with water. Okay. Mendeleevium typically carries a positive charge, often plus-three, but it can also shift to a plus-two or even plus-one charge depending on the conditions. So it has multiple personalities? You could say that. Chemically speaking? Yeah. Understanding these different oxidation states is crucial for figuring out how to work with and study Mendeleevium. It seems like we're dealing with an incredibly complex element. Yes. Especially since, as you said, we're working at the atomic level. Right. Let's talk more about that. Okay. What does the structure of a Mendeleevium atom look like? Mendeleevium has a whopping 101 electrons orbiting its nucleus. 101 electrons. And the way these electrons are arranged, their configuration plays a huge role in its chemical behavior. 101 electrons. Huh. I vaguely remember electron configurations from high school chemistry. Sure. But it's all a bit fuzzy now. Well, the basic idea is that electrons in an atom are organized in specific energy levels or orbitals, and it's the outermost electrons, called valence electrons, that are involved in chemical bonding with other atoms. So the way those 101 electrons are arranged is what makes Mendeleevium behave differently from other elements. Precisely. Its electron configuration makes it quite distinct from the earlier elements in the periodic table. This is all so fascinating. Yeah. But speaking of differences, I read that Mendeleevium comes in different varieties. It does. Called isotopes. You're right. Isotopes are like variations of an element. Okay. They have the same number of protons, which defines the element, but a different number of neutrons in their nucleus. Ah, okay. So it's like they have the same face, but different outfits. A good way to think about it. I like that. Mendeleevium has 17 known isotopes. Wow. But they're all radioactive and most decay very quickly. So they don't stick around for very long. Not at all. Okay. The most stable isotope, Mendeleevium-258, has a half-life of 51 days. Okay. But the isotope most often used in experiments, Mendeleevium-256, only lasts for a little over an hour. Wow. Imagine trying to study something that's constantly disappearing. I know, that's a challenge. No wonder they need those incredible techniques we talked about. Right. Speaking of which, how do they actually produce and isolate Mendeleevium? Right. It's not something you can just whip up in a lab, right? You're absolutely right. It's not a simple process. Okay. To create Mendeleevium, scientists use these massive machines called particle accelerators. They accelerate ions to incredible speeds and then smash them into targets made of heavier elements. I
