## Transcript

Hey everyone, welcome back. Today we're diving deep into something pretty massive, literally. Yeah, we're talking about the Square Kilometer Array. The SKA, right? That's the one. It's this huge, ambitious project to build, well, you could say the biggest radio telescope the world has ever seen. So I know a little bit about telescopes, but radio telescopes, I'm assuming it's not just a giant dish pointing at the sky? You're right, it's way more complex than that. Imagine thousands of antennas, all spread out over a huge area. Okay, so not your typical backyard telescope setup. And all these antennas are working together? Exactly. Like a giant interconnected web, they're all linked up, working in sync to basically act as one enormous telescope. Wow, that's incredible. And that's where the square kilometer part comes in, right? That's like the combined collecting area of all those antennas. You got it. And with that kind of collecting power, it's going to be 50 times more sensitive than any other radio telescope we have right now. 50 times? That's got to be like revolutionary for astronomy, right? What sorts of things will we be able to see with that kind of power? Think about it like this. It's like tuning into a cosmic radio station. But instead of music, we're picking up these incredibly faint signals, whispers from events that happened billions of years ago. Events that we wouldn't be able to see with regular optical telescopes. Exactly. Things that are hidden from view in visible light, they suddenly pop out in radio waves, black holes, the earliest stars and galaxies, you name it. Okay, color me intrigued. But before we get too deep into all the amazing science that the SKA can do, I'm curious about the project itself. This thing wasn't built overnight, right? Oh, absolutely not. It's been decades in the making. The initial ideas going back to 1991, formal planning started a couple of years later in 93. A truly global effort. Wow, that's a serious commitment. And speaking of global effort, I bet deciding where to build this thing was a whole other challenge. For sure. A lot of countries were vying to host the SKA. Even China, they had their own proposal called Carst. But in the end, two locations were chosen, Australia and South Africa. Why those two spots? Anything special about them? A couple of key things. First, they both have incredibly low radio interference, which is crucial for picking up those faint signals from space. Like a cosmic sanctuary, you could say. Makes sense. You wouldn't want any earthly noise drowning out the cosmic whispers. Right. And second, both locations have a clear view of the Milky Way. Perfect for exploring our own galactic neighborhood. So they split the project between these two locations. Is there a main headquarters as well? Yep. The SKA headquarters is at Jodrell Bank Observatory in the UK. Oh, I've heard of that. Isn't that where the Lovell Telescope is? The very same. A fitting place, considering the history and legacy of radio astronomy there. For sure. But wait, there's more to the story, isn't there? Something about phases of construction? You're picking up on it, yes. The SKA isn't just a one-and-done project. They're building it in stages. The first phase, SKA1, is already underway. How much of the whole thing is SKA1? About 10% of the final vision. So just a taste of what's to come. Okay, so they started building in? December 2022. A pretty historic moment. Aiming for completion. In 2028, if everything goes according to plan. Alright, so let's zoom in on this SKA1 for a bit. What exactly makes the technology behind it so unique? Well, as I mentioned, it's not one giant dish. It's a network of different types of antennas spread out over vast distances. All working together in a process called aperture synthesis. Aperture synthesis? Sounds fancy. What does that even mean? Basically, it's a way to combine the signals from all those antennas to create a telescope with incredible resolution. As if it were one giant dish spanning that entire area. Okay, so it's like having a thousand eyes looking at the sky instead of just one. Exactly. Each antenna captures a slightly different perspective. When you put it all together, you get a super sharp image. I like that analogy. It makes it much easier to visualize. So what about the antennas themselves? Are they like those massive satellite dishes we see in movies? Some of them are, but there are actually two main types. SKA-LO and SKA-MID. Okay, what's the difference? Well, SKA-LO uses what are called dipole antennas. They're a simpler design, kind of like those old school TV antennas. Ah, yeah, I remember those. So what are they picking up? SKA-LO is designed to capture lower frequency radio waves, the longer wavelengths. Gotcha. And then SKA-MID. That's where the dish antennas come in. They're designed to capture the higher frequency, shorter wavelength signals. And those dishes are massive, around 12 to 15 meters in diameter. Wow, that's pretty big. And all of this working together to create this incredibly powerful telescope. But I imagine all this cutting edge technology comes with a whole lot of data. How do they even handle all that information? It's a huge challenge, to be honest. We're talking about a telescope that's expected to generate more data in a single day than the entire internet currently handles. Whoa, that's almost impossible to grasp. What do you even do with that much data? It's a data processing challenge like no other. They'll be relying on supercomputers and some seriously advanced algorithms to sift through all the noise and extract the valuable signals. Sounds like they're pushing the limits of data science as much as they're pushing the limits of astronomy. Absolutely, it's a whole new ballgame. Okay, I think we've laid some really good groundwork here, getting a sense of the scale and complexity of the SKA. But now I'm really eager to dive into the science itself. What cosmic mysteries is this telescope going to help us solve? Well, that's what we'll be exploring in part two of our deep dive. Get ready for some mind-blowing stuff. Can't wait. See you there. All right, so we've covered the sheer scale of the SKA and the incredible technology behind it. Now let's get to the really exciting part, the science. What are some of the cosmic mysteries this telescope might help us unravel? Well, the SKA is designed to tackle some of the biggest questions in astronomy. One of the key projects is putting Einstein's theory of general relativity to the ultimate test. Now that sounds intense. How exactly will they do that? Imagine like a cosmic dance between some of the most extreme objects in the universe, pulsars and black holes. Okay, pulsars, those are? They're rapidly spinning neutron stars. They emit beams of radio waves. Oh, right, like cosmic lighthouses, right? Exactly. And we'll be looking at pulsars that orbit closely around black holes. So how do those black holes fit into all of this? Well, because pulsars act like super precise clocks, we can measure how their signals are affected by the intense gravity of the black hole. Ah, I see. So it's like using these cosmic clocks to measure the warping of spacetime, which is what Einstein's theory predicted, right? Exactly. And the SKA has the sensitivity to detect even the slightest deviations from general relativity. If Einstein's theory starts to break down in these extreme conditions, the SKA will be the one to tell us. Wow, that's mind-blowing. We might actually rewrite our understanding of gravity. But the SKA isn't just about black holes, right? I mean, we were talking about mapping a billion galaxies. You're right. The SKA is going to create the most detailed map of the universe ever made. A billion galaxies. That's just, I can't even wrap my head around that number. But what kind of insights can we gain from mapping all those galaxies? Well, it could help solve some of the biggest mysteries in cosmology, like the nature of dark matter and dark energy. These are things we can't directly see, but they seem to be shaping the universe as we know it. So the SKA is like a detective, helping us understand the unseen forces at play in the universe. That's a great way to put it. And not only can it help us map the universe as it is now, but the SKA can also peer back to the very early universe. Oh, wow. How far back are we talking? To a period known as the Epoch of Reionization. Epoch of Reionization. Okay, that one's new to me. What happened during that time? Think of it as the universe switching on the lights. Okay. Before this period, the universe was filled with this kind of fog of neutral hydrogen gas, which is opaque to certain types of light. But as the first stars and galaxies formed, their intense radiation started to ionize the gas, making the universe transparent to light. So it was like a cosmic dawn. Exactly. And the SKA will allow us to witness this cosmic dawn, studying the faint radio signals from that era and providing crucial insights into the processes that shaped the early universe. Wow, it's like having a time machine. Hold on, there's even more, right? Didn't you mention something about cosmic magnetism? Yeah, that's right. We know that magnetic fields exist throughout the universe, but we're still trying to understand how they originated and how they influenced the formation and evolution of galaxies. So how can the SKA help us solve this magnetic mystery? Well, the SKA can observe how radio waves are polarized as they pass through these magnetic fields. It's like using the universe as a giant laboratory to study magnetism. Okay
