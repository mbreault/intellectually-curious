## Transcript

Welcome back to our series on computer science. Today we're diving into a research paper with a very catchy title. You Cannot Do That, Ben Stokes. Dynamically Predicting Shot Typing Cricket Using a Personalized Deep Neural Network. It sounds like we're about to explore how AI can be used to understand and maybe even predict one of the most exciting aspects of cricket. The batsman's choice of shot. That's right. This research uses artificial intelligence to predict not only where a cricket ball will go, but also the batsman's intent behind each shot. So it's not just about predicting where the ball will land, but about getting inside the batsman's head. Exactly. Can you explain how the researchers approached this challenge? What kind of information did they use? Well, they use a massive amount of data. Think about eight years worth of international cricket matches, each with detailed records of every ball bowled and every shot played. This data is then fed into a powerful tool called a deep neural network. Okay, let's pause there for a second. For our listeners who might not be familiar with deep neural networks, could you explain what they are and why they're so useful in this context? Of course. Imagine a computer program that learns in a way similar to the human brain. It takes in vast amounts of information, identifies patterns, and then uses those patterns to make predictions. Okay. That's essentially what a deep neural network does. In this case, it's learning the patterns of how different batsmen react to different bowlers and game situations. So it's like having a superpowered cricket analyst who can process years of data and identify tendencies that even the most experienced coaches might miss. Exactly. But how do they define shot type in a way that a computer can understand? That's a great question. They go beyond simply looking at the final location of the ball. Instead, they divide the cricket field into 16 zones and combine that with three levels of aggression. Defensive, neutral, and aggressive. This creates a more nuanced understanding of the batsman's intent. So even if a defensive shot ends up going for a boundary because of clever placement, the model can still recognize that the batsman's intention was to defend, not attack. Right. That's incredibly insightful. Exactly. It's about understanding the strategy behind the shot, not just the outcome. And by incorporating this level of detail, the researchers are able to make remarkably accurate predictions about a batsman's shot selection. Now, you mentioned the importance of personalized features in this research. Can you explain what those are and why they're so crucial for making accurate predictions? Absolutely. Personalized features are all about understanding the unique tendencies and strengths of each individual player. The model isn't just looking at general trends in cricket. It's taking into account the individual nuances of each player's game. So it recognizes that Ben Stokes has a different batting style than, say, Joe Root. Yes. And it incorporates those individual differences into its predictions. Precisely. The researchers achieved this by analyzing the previous 500 deliveries faced by each batsman and bowler. This creates a dynamic profile that evolves as they play more matches, allowing the model to capture their individual styles and preferences with remarkable accuracy. That's incredibly impressive. And they actually tested this model using data from a very high-stakes match. Yes. The 2019 Cricket World Cup final. Yes. And to really demonstrate the power of their model, they focused on that nail-biting final over where England needed nine runs from the last three balls with Ben Stokes facing Trent Bolt. Okay. I remember that match vividly. Yeah. The tension was incredible. Yeah. What did their model reveal about that specific situation? Well, remember that moment when Bolt bowled that attempted yorker that ended up as a full toss? Of course, Stokes smashed it for six, bringing England back into the game. And the researchers' model predicted that outcome. Based on Stokes' personal tendencies, Bolt's bowling style, and the intense pressure of that game situation, the model suggested that Stokes was highly likely to go for a big shot in that exact zone. That's fascinating. So it wasn't just luck or a moment of brilliance from Stokes. The model was suggesting that it was a statistically likely outcome based on all the factors at play. Exactly. It's like the model was able to read Stokes' mind, or at least anticipate his intentions, based on his past behavior and the circumstances of the game. And the researchers took their analysis even further. They didn't just look at that one crucial delivery. They actually simulated a whole range of deliveries that Bolt could have bowled and predicted Stokes' likely responses. So they were essentially creating a what-if scenario, exploring how different bowling choices might have affected the outcome of that. Precisely. They wanted to understand not just what happened, but what could have happened. And their findings were quite insightful. For example, they discovered that simply bowling yorker after yorker might not have been the best strategy. That's surprising. I would think a well-executed yorker would be very difficult to score off. Why would the model suggest otherwise? Because it takes into account the dynamic interplay between bowler, batsman, and game situation. While a yorker can be effective, the model suggests that in that specific situation with Stokes already in an aggressive mindset, it might have actually increased his chances of connecting for a boundary. So the pressure of needing nine runs from three balls might have made Stokes more likely to take a risk on a yorker, even though it's a difficult delivery to hit. Exactly. And by recognizing that dynamic, the New Zealand captain might have considered a more varied approach, perhaps mixing in some slower deliveries or bowling at different lines and lengths to keep Stokes guessing. It really highlights the complexity of the game and how even seemingly obvious choices can have unexpected consequences. And that's where this kind of AI-powered analysis can be so valuable. It can help us understand those nuances and make more informed decisions. Now, so far we've been focusing primarily on how the model analyzes a batsman's tendencies, but the researchers also emphasize the importance of personalized features for each bowler, not just the batsman. That's an important point. Just as each batsman has a unique style, so does each bowler. And incorporating those individual nuances into the model can lead to even more accurate predictions. So it's not just about looking at a generic fast bowler or spin bowler, but understanding the specific strengths, weaknesses, and tendencies of each individual bowler. Exactly. For instance, they simulated how Stokes might approach deliveries from Lockie Ferguson, a right-arm fast bowler known for his speed. Okay, so we're comparing a right-arm fast bowler like Ferguson to a left-arm fast bowler like Bolt. What did the model reveal about these contrasting matchups? The model predicted some fascinating differences in Stokes' likely shot selection, even when facing similar deliveries from Bolt and Ferguson. Even when Ferguson bowled from around the wicket, mimicking the angle of a left-arm bowler, the model anticipated a different response from Stokes. So even though the deliveries might appear similar on paper, the model recognized that Ferguson's unique style and the angle from which he bowls would likely elicit a distinct response from Stokes. Precisely. It highlights how crucial it is to consider not just the type of delivery, but also the individual bowler delivering it. And this is where personalized features really shine. This is really insightful. We're moving beyond simply analyzing data and towards a deeper understanding of the individual players and their complex interactions on the field. Absolutely. And this research shows how AI can be a powerful tool for achieving that level of understanding. Now this leads us to a broader question. Could this technology actually change the game itself? It's certainly possible. As this kind of technology becomes more widely adopted, we might see a shift towards more data-driven strategies in cricket. Teams could use these predictions to make more informed decisions about everything from bowling changes and field placements to batting orders. It's fascinating to think about how this research could impact the future of cricket. Could it lead to a more strategic, almost chess-like approach to the game? I think it has the potential to do so. We might see a greater emphasis on pre-match planning, with teams using these models to develop tailored strategies for specific opponents and match situations. And during the game, captains could use real-time predictions to make more informed tactical decisions. It's like we're moving from a game of instinct and intuition to a game of data and analysis, with AI serving as a powerful tool to enhance decision-making. Right. But it's important to remember that AI is not meant to replace human skill and judgment. It's about augmenting those abilities, providing coaches and players with deeper insights to help them make better decisions. This reminds me of how computers have revolutionized chess. They haven't made the game obsolete. They've pushed players to reach new levels of strategic thinking. That's a great analogy. And just as in chess, the introduction of AI in cricket could lead to a fascinating evolution of the game. I wonder how this technology might affect the players themselves. Do you think we'll see bowlers becoming less predictable in their approach, trying to avoid falling into patterns that the AI could easily recognize? That's a very real possibility. As bowlers become aware of this technology, they'll likely try to make themselves less predictable. We might see more variation in deliveries, more emphasis on disguising their intentions, and more focus on disrupting the batsman's rhythm. And on the batting side, do you think we might see players developing new and innovative shots to exploit weaknesses in the AI's predictions? Absolutely. Just as bowlers will try to outsmart the AI, so will batsmen. They'll analyze the data, look for patterns, and try to come up with ways to counter the strategies suggested by the models. It could lead to a fascinating arms race between technology and human ingenuity. This is truly fascinating. It seems like this research is opening up a whole new frontier in the world of cricket, blurring the lines between data analysis, strategic thinking,
