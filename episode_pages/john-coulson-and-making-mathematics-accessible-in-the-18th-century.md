## Transcript

Welcome back to our deep dive into the fascinating history of the Lucasian professors of mathematics at Cambridge. This is our sixth episode, and today we're going to shift our focus to John Coulson, the fifth individual to hold this prestigious chair. You might not find his name etched alongside giants like Newton or Barrow, but his story offers a unique perspective on the evolution of mathematics in the 18th century. What's intriguing about Coulson is that his contributions extend beyond groundbreaking discoveries. He played a crucial role in making complex mathematical ideas accessible to a wider audience, which is a significant achievement in itself. Absolutely. It's like you recognize that knowledge is most powerful when it's shared and understood. So let's rewind a bit and trace Coulson's path to the Lucasian chair. He takes on the role in 1739, just 12 years after Newton's death. Stepping into those shoes must have been quite daunting, considering Newton's immense legacy. Indeed. It's worth noting that Coulson's journey to Cambridge was anything but conventional. He began his career as a schoolmaster, far from the hallowed halls of academia. That's right. He started at Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School in Rochester. It's fascinating to see how his path unfolded, eventually leading him to become a fellow of the Royal Society in 1713. His trajectory then took him to Cambridge, where he lectured at Sidney Sussex College. Interestingly, he didn't receive his MA until 1728 at the age of 48, which speaks to his commitment to lifelong learning. It challenges the notion that academic success follows a linear path. He eventually secured the Lucasian chair in 1739, a position he held until his death in 1760. Now, while the Lucasian chair is deeply rooted in mathematical tradition, Coulson wasn't just a numbers guy. His interests spanned languages, philosophy, and even religion. Precisely. This multifaceted background likely influenced his approach to mathematics. One example is his development of Negativo-Affirmativo arithmetic. While the name might sound a bit like a secret code, it represents Coulson's efforts to simplify complex calculations. So how exactly did this system work? What was its significance in the context of 18th-century mathematics? Imagine a time when all calculations were done by hand. Coulson's system utilized negative numbers, a relatively new concept then, to streamline these operations, particularly when dealing with large numbers. It's like he was developing a more efficient set of tools for mathematical work. Did his system gain widespread acceptance among mathematicians of the era? While it didn't revolutionize mathematical practice, it highlighted Coulson's focus on the practical application of mathematical principles. He was always seeking ways to make math work better in the real world. This emphasis on practicality seems to be a recurring theme in Coulson's work. And speaking of practical applications, didn't he also invent something called accounting table to aid in calculations? He hinted at such a device in his writings, but unfortunately no detailed descriptions or schematics have survived. Its exact nature remains a mystery, lost to the mists of time. It's almost like a hidden chapter in Coulson's story waiting to be rediscovered. Perhaps one day we'll uncover the secrets of his accounting table. Now shifting gears a bit, it's essential to recognize Coulson's significant role as a translator. He played a pivotal role in bringing the works of Newton and other influential thinkers to a wider English-speaking audience. His translation of Newton's De Methodus Serierum et Fluxionum in 1736 stands out as a prime example. Making these groundbreaking ideas accessible to a broader readership must have had a considerable impact on the dissemination of knowledge. Absolutely. He wasn't simply translating words. He was conveying complex mathematical concepts in a way that made them comprehensible to a larger audience, which is a skill in itself. It's like he was building a bridge between the often intimidating world of advanced mathematics and those who were eager to learn but lacked the specialized language to access it. That's a great analogy. And this brings us to another fascinating aspect of Coulson's legacy, his remarkable foresight in championing women in STEM centuries ahead of his time. Now this is something I find particularly interesting. Could you elaborate on his efforts in this regard? Well, in an era when women were largely excluded from higher education, Coulson recognized the importance of making advanced mathematics accessible to them. It was a time when societal norms often limited women's access to educational opportunities, particularly in the sciences. So how did Coulson challenge these norms? He undertook the translation of Maria Agnesi's Analytical Institutions, a groundbreaking work that holds the distinction of being the first calculus textbook written by a woman. So he was intentionally trying to bring this knowledge to a female audience. That's quite progressive for the 18th century. Precisely. His translation underscores his commitment to inclusivity in education and his recognition of the untapped potential of women in the field of mathematics. Sadly, his manuscript didn't see the light of day until 1801, long after his death. That's unfortunate. Imagine the impact it could have had if published during his lifetime. It might have inspired generations of women to pursue mathematics. It makes you wonder how many other groundbreaking contributions have been lost or delayed due to similar societal barriers. It certainly highlights the importance of recognizing and supporting diverse voices in STEM fields throughout history. And speaking of Coulson's commitment to inclusivity, he also worked on another manuscript titled The Plan of the Lady System of Analytics, which further demonstrates his dedication to making mathematics accessible to women. It seems he was quite determined to break down those gender barriers in academia. Where is that manuscript now? It's currently held in the Cambridge Library, serving as a testament to his forward-thinking approach to education. It's remarkable how Coulson's legacy extends beyond his own mathematical work. He was a true advocate for knowledge and its accessibility. Now, we talked a lot about his role as a translator and educator, but what about his own contributions to mathematics? Didn't he publish several papers on various topics? Yes, indeed. Aside from his work on Negativo-Affirmativo arithmetic, Coulson published papers on a range of mathematical subjects, demonstrating his diverse interests within the field. What were some of the specific areas he explored in his research? One notable paper, published in Latin, focused on a method for solving quadratic and bi-quadratic equations. This choice of language highlights the continued influence of Latin as the universal language of scholarship, particularly in mathematics and the sciences, even as English gained prominence. It's fascinating to see how these linguistic transitions played out in the academic world. So, in addition to his work on simplifying calculations, Coulson was also delving into more abstract mathematical concepts. Precisely. Another paper, this time published in English, delved deeper into his Negativo-Affirmative arithmetic, providing a more detailed explanation of its principles and applications. It seems this concept was a particular focus for him. Can you remind us again how this system worked and what advantages it offered? Certainly. At its core, Negativo-Affirmative arithmetic involved using a combination of negative and positive digits to represent numbers, almost like a coded system. Coulson devised specific rules for converting standard numbers into this form and back again, as well as rules for performing arithmetic operations using this system. So it was more than just a different way of writing numbers. It was a complete system for calculation. Did he claim any practical benefits for using this method? According to Coulson, his system could significantly speed up the multiplication of large numbers, a tedious task when done by hand. It's a testament to his ingenuity and his desire to push the boundaries of practical mathematics. It's a reminder that innovation often lies in finding clever solutions to everyday problems. And this drive for practicality wasn't limited to his work with numbers. Didn't he also apply his mathematical skills to the field of mapmaking? You're absolutely right. His final paper, also published in English, tackled the challenges of mapmaking, specifically the complexities of converting between a flat surface and a spherical surface, a problem that has fascinated cartographers for centuries. Ah, yes, the age-old challenge of representing our three-dimensional world on a two-dimensional plane. It's a problem with both practical and theoretical implications. Indeed. And Coulson's work in this area demonstrates his understanding of geometry and its real-world applications. He seemed to constantly seek ways to connect mathematical principles with tangible solutions to real-world issues. It speaks to his belief in the power of mathematics to shape and improve the world around us. It's a perspective that resonates even today, as we see mathematics playing an increasingly vital role in fields ranging from technology to finance to medicine. Absolutely. Now, beyond his published papers, we've already touched on his incredible work as a translator, particularly his efforts to make complex scientific knowledge more accessible. But there's another layer to his translation work that we haven't explored yet. His connection to the world of navigation. His involvement in navigation seems like an unexpected twist for a Lucasian professor. How did he become engaged with this maritime world? It stemmed surprisingly from his passion for translation. Alongside translating complex mathematical treatises, he was deeply involved in translating and elucidating works related to navigation. You could say he was a one-man knowledge dissemination machine. It's fascinating to see how his interests intertwined. So what were some of the specific navigational works he tackled? He made significant contributions to publications like The Mariners Magazine and The Mariners New Calendar. These were publications aimed directly at a seafaring audience and contained practical information on a wide array of nautical topics. So we're not talking about theoretical mathematics here, but rather the hands-on knowledge needed to navigate the open seas. Precisely. Coulson translated and provided commentary on material covering geometry, trigonometry, the principles of sailing, and even the art of navigating by the stars, both day and night. His work provided a comprehensive guide to the skills required for successful seafaring. That's an impressive range. It sounds like he was essentially creating a bridge between the theoretical world of mathematics and the very practical demands of life at sea
