## Transcript

Welcome to this deep dive into the really fascinating world of number sequences. Glad to be here. Today we're venturing into the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS as most people call it. An indispensable tool. And we're focusing specifically on one entry, A-0190. If you're studying number theory, this one's a really neat example of some core ideas. Indeed. The OEIS is just an incredible catalog, thousands upon thousands of sequences. And this one, A-190, it asks a pretty clear question. Which is? For any given whole number n, how many solutions does the congruence x to the fourth power x A-0 mod n actually have? Counting solutions between 0 and n-1. Right. So our mission today is to sort of unpack that, look at the sequence that pops out and see why it matters in the OEIS, what it tells us. And the OEIS entry itself gives us plenty to work with. You've got the sequence terms, formulas, connections. Exactly. So let's start with the sequence itself. The first few terms go 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2, and so on. I won't read them all, there are quite a few listed. It keeps going, yeah. 1, 1, 1, 8 for n at 16, then 1, 3, 1, 2. And importantly, this sequence starts at n1. So a1 is 1, a2 is 1, a3 is 1, a4 is 2. Correct. And what becomes interesting quite quickly is how this count in behaves as n itself changes. It's not random. No, definitely not. And one of the really key properties here, something super useful in number theory, is that this function an is multiplicative. Yes, absolutely crucial. And multiplicative just means if you take two numbers, let's say mn, and they don't share any common factors besides 1. They're relatively prime. Right, relatively prime. Then the value of the function for their product, am times n, is simply am multiplied by an. Which is super powerful, right? Because it means we can break down the problem. Exactly. If we understand how an behaves for prime numbers and powers of prime numbers, we can use this multiplicative property to figure it out for any number n just by looking at its prime factors. It's like knowing the properties of the basic building blocks lets you understand the whole structure. So speaking of those building blocks, the prime powers, the OEIS gives a really neat formula for a, where p is a prime and e is a positive integer. It's quite elegant. The formula is a equals p raised to the power of the floor of 3e divided by 4. So p3e4. Right, that notation, the floor function here. Yeah, let's clarify that. It just means you take the greatest whole number that's less than or equal to whatever is inside. Exactly. So like the floor of 3.7 is 3, floor of 5 is just 5. And why do we need that floor function here? Seems a bit specific. Well, think about it. an counts the number of solutions. That has to be a whole number, an integer. But the exponent, 3e4, that might not be a whole number itself. Ah, right. Like 3 times 1 divided by 4 is 0.75, not an integer. Exactly. So the floor function ensures we always get an integer exponent for p, which results in an integer value for a, our count of solutions. Guarantees a whole number count. Okay, that makes sense. Shall we try it out? Maybe with p2? Sure, let's take p2. If e1, we get 2 3 14, 2 3 14. The floor of 0.75 is 0, so 2e is in 1. Okay, a2 is 1. Matches the sequence. Now e2. a2 is 3 24, 264 year 2 1.54, floor of 1.5 is 1, so 2 of 1 is 2 in the sequence. Let's do e3. a2 and e2 in 294 year 2.25, floor is 2, so 2 of 1 is 4. a8 is 4. Looks good. One more, e4. Why not? a2 earn 16, 2 on 24 yields 2 3, floor 3 is 3, so 2 in is 8. And a16 is indeed 8. Wow, okay, that formula works perfectly for powers of 2. It does. We could try p3 as well. Okay, a3. That's e1. 3 3 14 yield 3 0.75, which is the third term. And a3, which is a9. That's e2. 3 3 3 4 4 3 1.55, yield 3. And a9 is 3 in the list. Yeah, it's really clean how that captures it. And now we see the power of putting it together with the multiplicative property. Right, for composite numbers, how about n6? Okay, n6. First, prime factorization. 6 must equal a times a3. 2 and 3 are relatively prime. Correct, so because an is multiplicative, a6 must equal a2 times a3. And we just found a2, 1, and a3, 1. So a6, 1, 1, 1, 1. Which is the sixth term in the sequence. Fantastic. So we don't actually need to count the solutions for x s as 0 mod 6. We can just use the formula for primes and the multiplicative rule. Precisely. It gives us a much more efficient way to calculate any term an once we know the prime factorization of n. That's really elegant. Now the OEIS page also mentions something called a Dirichlet generating function. It looks intense. Zeta 4s s3 times a product over primes. Ah, yes. Dirichlet generating functions. They look a bit scary, maybe, if you haven't encountered them much. A little bit. What's the gist? Think of it as, well, another way to package up the entire sequence. It's an infinite series. Specifically, sum a n n s, where s is a complex variable. And the amazing thing is that the form of this function often reveals deep properties of the sequence an. So it's not just for calculation, it's for understanding structure. Exactly. The fact that it involves the Riemann zeta function, zeta s, and has this product form over primes that immediately tells a number theorist that the function an is multiplicative and is deeply connected to the primes. It allows us to use tools from analysis to study the sequence. So it's like a coded message about the sequence's nature. You could say that, yes. A very powerful coded message. Okay. Moving on to something maybe more immediately practical, the OEIS entry also gives some code snippets. There's one for Mathematica. Right. The first one listed is often a direct computation from the definition. Yeah, it says array function n, counter array power mod, hashtag 4, n and n, 0, 0, 0, 100, 0. Looks like it's literally checking every number x from 0 to n, 1, calculating x o mod n, and counting how many times it gets 0. That's it. Brute force, essentially. It verifies the definition. Yeah. Good for checking small values, but it gets slow pretty fast. Then there's another mathematical one that seems different. fp e, p floor 3 e 4, a 1 a 1 1, and then times at f, at factor integrin, array 100. Uh-huh. Now this one uses the method we just discussed. You see the function f, that's calculating our formula, ap. Right. So you see the p floor 3 4. And then for general n, it uses factor integrin to get the prime factors and their exponents. Like finding 6 equals 2 to years and 3 years. Exactly. And then it applies the function f to each prime power factor, like f 2 1 and f 3 1, and multiplies the results together the times at part. So this code implements the multiplicative property and the prime power formula. Precisely. Much, much more efficient, especially for large n. And there's a pair of GP snippet too. Yeah. prod i 1, hashtag f 1 5 1 3 5 2 4, looks very similar in spirit. It is. Factor n gets the prime factorization, then it iterates through the factors. prod i 1 takes the prime base 5 1, raises it to the power 3 5 5, where 5 2 is the exponent e and 4 is pri's integer division, effectively doing the floor of 3 4. So again, factorization, then apply the formula. It really drives home that this multiplicative approach is the way to go computationally. It's the power of theory informing practice. Find the property, exploit it for an efficient algorithm. Now shifting gears slightly, the comments mention something intriguing. This sequence, A000190, is the shadow transform of fourth powers, which is sequence A000583 shadow transform. Ah, the shadow transform. It's a specific operation you can perform on sequences. It's a bit technical to define fully here. Just the gist. The gist is
