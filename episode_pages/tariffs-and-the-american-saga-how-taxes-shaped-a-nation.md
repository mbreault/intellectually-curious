## Transcript

Welcome to our deep dive today. So, you sent us a ton of really fascinating articles and notes all about US tariffs. Yeah. And it seems like you're really trying to understand how these taxes have shaped American history, you know? Right. How they've impacted different groups, the debates they've caused, the whole thing. It really is fascinating how something like tariffs, which we often think of as like a kind of dry economic topic, are actually like woven into the very fabric of American history. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. And you know, our sources really make it clear that the US has this long and complicated history with tariffs going all the way back to the beginning of the nation. Right back to the start. Yeah. One thing that really stood out to me was that for over a century, tariffs were like the main source of income for the federal government. It's pretty crazy when you think about it today, right? It's a really big deal, yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're not just talking about like a small chunk of revenue here. Right. Sometimes tariffs brought in something like 95% of the money the government needed to operate. 95%. So like almost everything the government was doing, from paying soldiers to building roads, was funded by taxes on imported goods. Pretty much. That's wild. It really puts into perspective how essential tariffs were to the early US economy and how they were such a hot-button issue right from the start. Absolutely. And when you think about who benefited from those tariffs and who didn't, it's no surprise that they caused so much tension. Yeah. One figure who really emerges as a key player in these early tariff battles is Alexander Hamilton. Oh yeah, of course, the first Secretary of the Treasury. Exactly. He wasn't just advocating for tariffs as a way to raise money, but as like a tool to build a strong and independent American economy. So he saw tariffs as more than just a revenue stream. Right. What was his like bigger vision? So in his report on manufacturers, he lays out what many consider the first expression of modern protectionist theory. Interesting. Essentially, he argued that young American industries, you know, they just couldn't compete with the more established European industries unless they were given some breathing room to grow. So tariffs were a way to protect these infant industries, as he called them, until they could compete on their own. Exactly. Hamilton believed that by shielding American industries from foreign competition, at least temporarily, the US could eventually become a global manufacturing powerhouse. Wow. Independent of Europe. It's interesting to think about how this idea of infant industry protection is still being debated today. For sure. Some argue it's crucial for developing economies, while others say it leads to inefficiency and hurts consumers in the long run. Yeah, that's a great point. Yeah. It seems like right from the beginning, tariffs were about more than just economics. Oh, absolutely. They were tied to like these big questions of national identity, independence, what kind of future the US wanted to build. Right. But if Hamilton was such a strong supporter of tariffs, I imagine not everyone agreed with him. Oh, of course not. Who were some of the main opponents of his vision? Well, the 19th century saw fierce debates about tariffs. Yeah. With the nation largely divided along regional and economic lines, it was basically a battle between North and South. Ah, classic American story. Industry versus agriculture. So who are the main players on each side of this like tariff tug of war? On one side, you had Northern industrialists and their workers who favored high tariffs. Okay. They saw these taxes as essential for protecting their businesses and jobs from cheaper goods coming in from overseas. That makes sense. Higher tariffs would make those imported goods more expensive, giving American-made products an advantage. Right. What about the South? Southern planters and farmers whose livelihoods depended on exporting cotton and other agricultural products wanted to keep tariffs low. Right. Their reasoning was simple. Lower tariffs meant more international trade. Yeah. More trade meant more buyers for their goods. I see. Yeah, that makes sense too. High tariffs on imported goods would likely lead to other countries putting tariffs on American goods like cotton in retaliation, which would hurt the South's economy. So is this just a polite disagreement or did these tariff battles ever get really heated? Oh, they definitely got heated. In fact, one particular tariff nearly tore the nation apart. Really? Yeah. Wow, a tariff that nearly tore the nation apart. Yeah, that's kind of hard to imagine. You know, it seems like tariffs were also really intertwined with the whole issue of slavery and states' rights, which ultimately led to the Civil War. Yeah, you're spot on connecting those dots. The Tariff of 1828, which is often called the Tariff of Abominations, is like a perfect example. Okay. This tariff, which significantly raised taxes on imported manufactured goods, sparked total outrage in the South. I see. Southern leaders argued that it unfairly benefited northern industries at the expense of the southern economy, which was heavily reliant on exports. Yeah, that makes sense. So this tariff really became a symbol of the growing economic and political divisions between the North and the South. Absolutely. Did it actually, like, contribute to the outbreak of the Civil War? Well, while it wasn't the only cause, the Tariff of Abominations definitely made things worse. It, like, intensified the debate over federal power versus states' rights, which was a key issue that ultimately led to the South's secession. It's a crazy reminder of how economic policies like tariffs can have massive political and social consequences. Yeah, that's a really good point. It's fascinating how a tax on imported goods could have such a huge ripple effect. So how did the Civil War itself impact tariff policy? Well, the Civil War really shifted the landscape. With the South's secession, the Republican Party, which generally favored protectionist policies, gained firm control of the federal government. Okay. And tariffs were then seen as a crucial tool for funding the war effort and promoting northern industries. So the war essentially solidified the Republican Party's commitment to protectionism. Exactly. After the war, high tariffs remained in place, partly due to the ongoing need for revenue and partly to continue supporting those northern industries. This further fueled resentment in the South, which felt increasingly marginalized in the new economic order. It seems like the tariff issue became even more entangled with the legacy of the Civil War and the balance of power between the North and South. Yeah, it did. How did this dynamic play out in the decades after the war? Well, the debate over tariffs just raged on, largely reflecting those ongoing tensions between different regions and economic interests. The Republican Party, generally representing northern industrial interests, consistently pushed for high tariffs to protect American businesses and workers from foreign competition. And I imagine the Democratic Party, which had more support in the South, advocated for lower tariffs. Exactly. Democrats generally argued that high tariffs only benefited a select few, you know, the wealthy industrialists, while hurting consumers who had to pay higher prices for goods. Hmm. Because it sounds like this debate has echoes even today, with arguments over free trade versus protectionism continuing to shape economic policy. For sure. So as the U.S. industrialized rapidly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, did this tariff debate ever lead to any significant consequences beyond just the political clashes? Oh, it definitely did. One of the most dramatic examples is the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, often cited as a key factor in worsening the Great Depression. Oh, yeah. I've heard of Smoot-Hawley, but I don't really understand how a tariff could have such a huge impact on the entire economy. Can you explain the connection? Sure. So the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act passed right at the beginning of the Great Depression, raised tariffs on thousands of imported goods to record levels. Okay. The intention was to protect American businesses and farmers from foreign competition during the economic downturn. So it sounds like a well-intentioned but ultimately misguided policy. Yeah, unfortunately. Instead of helping the American economy, Smoot-Hawley really backfired. How so? Other countries retaliated with their own tariffs, creating a global trade war. Oh, wow. This like tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs had a devastating impact on international trade, basically choking off the flow of goods and services across borders. So it wasn't just the higher prices for consumers, it was the whole disruption of global trade that caused the problem. Exactly. Smoot-Hawley created this like vicious cycle. As countries put up trade barriers, global demand plummeted, further deepening the economic crisis. It's a stark example of how protectionist policies, while seemingly protecting domestic industries in the short term, can ultimately lead to economic disaster. It sounds like a cautionary tale about the unintended consequences of economic policy decisions. But you mentioned that Smoot-Hawley kind of marked a turning point in US trade policy. What happened after that? Did the US learn from its mistakes? Yeah. Yeah, it really does seem like the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was a wake-up call for the US. It definitely highlighted the dangers of going too far with protectionism. Right. You know, it showed how interconnected the global economy had become and just how disruptive these trade wars could be. So did this experience lead to like a complete shift away from protectionism? Well, Smoot-Hawley definitely had an impact. Yeah. But the shift away from protectionism wasn't immediate. Okay. So what happened next in this evolution of US trade policy? Well, the real turning point came after World War II. You know, the US emerged from the war as like a global superpower. Right. And they really started championing a new approach. Okay. It focused on promoting free trade as a means of fostering, you know, economic growth and
