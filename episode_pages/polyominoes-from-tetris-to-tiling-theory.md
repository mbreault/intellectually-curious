## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing exploration of number theory. Oh, it's great to be back. Today we're taking a deep dive into the fascinating world of polyominoes. It's amazing how such simple shapes can open up such a rich vein of mathematical inquiry. I know, we've talked about prime numbers, Fibonacci sequences, all sorts of intriguing concepts. But this time it's all about these geometric figures and the surprising complexity they bring to the table. Exactly. Polyominoes touch upon combinatorics, as well as tiling problems, and even computational challenges that push the limits of what we can solve efficiently. Exactly. So let's start with the basics. Sure. What exactly are polyominoes, and what makes them so special? Imagine you have a set of square tiles, like the ones you might find in a board game. Okay. A polyomino is formed by taking any number of these squares and joining them edge to edge. Okay, like puzzle pieces made up of squares. Exactly. So a single square would be a monomino. Two squares would be a domino. Exactly. And as you add more squares, the number of possible shapes explodes. Yeah. Three squares give you trominos. Okay. Four squares give you tetrominos. But it's not just about the number of squares, right? Right. We also have to consider how we're allowed to manipulate these shapes. You're right. Okay. There are actually three main types of polyominoes. Okay. Free. Okay. One-sided and fixed. Okay. Think of it like this. Imagine you have a physical polyomino piece in your hand. Okay. A free polyomino is like any regular puzzle piece. Got it. You can flip it over, rotate it, and it's still considered the same shape. Got it. Okay. So a square is a free monomino. Yes. And there's only one possible free domino, even though I can rotate it to be horizontal or vertical. Precisely. Now, one-sided polyominoes are a bit trickier. Yeah. You can rotate them, but you can't flip them over. Right. Think of the L-shaped tromino. Right. If you flipped it over, it would become a backwards L, which is considered a different shape. Yeah. Ah, I see. So there are actually two distinct one-sided trominos. Correct. But only one free tromino. That's right. And fixed polyominoes sound like they're locked in place on a grid. Exactly. Okay. Each fixed polyomino is unique depending on its position and orientation on the grid. So how many of each type are there? So... Does it get complicated quickly? It definitely does. Let's start small. Okay. There's one free domino. Uh-huh. Two free trominos. Uh-huh. Five free tetrominos. Does that last one ring a bell? Wait a minute. Yeah. Five tetrominos? Isn't that how many shapes there are in Tetris? You got it. Tetris actually uses one-sided tetrominos. The I, the O, the T, the L, and the J shapes. So Tetris is secretly a math lesson in disguise. That's pretty cool. Yeah. But I bet the number of polyominoes skyrockets as you add more squares, right? Absolutely. For example... Okay. There are 12 free pentominos, which are made up of five squares. And when it comes to fixed polyominoes, mathematicians have actually managed to enumerate them up to size 70. 70? That must be an astronomical number of shapes. It is. How do they even keep track of all of them? That brings us to the fascinating challenge of counting polyominoes. Okay. And it's surprisingly tricky. Okay. There's no simple... Right. ...elegant formula to directly calculate the number of polyominoes for any given size. So how do mathematicians go about counting them? They rely on clever algorithms. Okay. Often using what's called an inductive approach. Okay. They start with smaller polyominoes and figure out all the possible ways to add a square to create larger ones. I see. So they're building up from smaller shapes to larger ones, like a step-by-step process. Right. But I imagine there are a lot of potential pitfalls. Yeah. Accidentally counting the same shape multiple times. You're absolutely right. Okay. That's why mathematicians have come up with ingenious algorithms to avoid those pitfalls. Okay. For example, there's an algorithm called Riedelmeier's algorithm. Okay. Which is remarkably efficient. Efficient. Why is that so important in this case? Well, because the number of polyominoes grows incredibly fast. Efficiency becomes crucial. Riedelmeier's algorithm avoids having to store all the smaller polyominoes in memory, which would quickly become overwhelming as the size increases. That makes sense. So even with clever algorithms, counting polyominoes is a computationally demanding task. It is. I'm guessing there are even more sophisticated methods out there? There are. Okay. The most efficient method currently used is called the transfer matrix method, or TMA. Okay. It's a powerful technique that has allowed mathematicians to count fixed polyominoes up to that impressive size 70 we talked about. Wow. That's pretty remarkable. Yeah. But it sounds like even with our computational power, there's still a fundamental mystery at the heart of polyomino enumeration. Right. Here we have these powerful algorithms, but no neat and tidy formula to give us the answer directly. Exactly. It highlights how seemingly simple mathematical objects can harbor profound complexity. Yeah. And mathematicians are still working on unraveling all the secrets of polyominoes. Okay. So we've talked about the different types of polyominoes and the surprisingly tricky task of counting them. Right. But now I'm curious about what happens when we start putting these shapes together. Sure. Let's delve into the world of tiling with polyominoes, shall we? That's where things get really interesting. Okay. Can you cover a specific region completely using a given set of polyominoes? That's the fundamental question we're trying to answer. And I'm guessing the complexity of that question depends on the region you're trying to tile. Exactly. A simple square is probably a lot easier than, say, an irregular shape with lots of holes. You're absolutely right. Okay. Solomon Golomb, a pioneer in polyomino research, actually defined a hierarchy of regions, starting from simple rectangles and going all the way up to the challenge of tiling the entire infinite plane. Tiling the entire plane with polyominoes. That sounds like a task for a supercomputer, if not an army of mathematicians. It can be. And to add to the challenge, the general tiling problem is what's called NP-complete in computer science terms. Okay. I have to admit, NP-complete sounds a bit intimidating. Sure. Can you break that down for us non-computer scientists? Think about packing your car trunk for a trip. Okay. If you only have a few bags, it's relatively easy to fit them in. Right. But if you suddenly have a dozen more bags of all shapes and sizes, it becomes a nightmare. Figuring out the optimal arrangement gets exponentially harder. Ah, I see. So as the number of polyomino pieces increases, the difficulty of determining if they can tile a region grows exponentially, just like trying to cram all those bags into the trunk. Exactly. It quickly becomes a problem that even computers struggle with. Okay. Brute force approaches, where you try every possible configuration, simply won't cut it for larger sets of polyominoes. So we need more sophisticated strategies to tackle these tiling challenges. Are there any particular tools or tricks that mathematicians use to analyze these problems? There are. One valuable tool is called the Conway criterion, which helps determine if a single polyomino can tile the entire plane. Okay. It involves analyzing the shape of the polyomino and looking for specific arrangements of its edges. So it's a way to quickly rule out polyominoes that have no chance of tiling the plane. That must save a lot of time and effort. It does. But like any good mathematical rule, it has its exceptions. Okay. There are a few known polyominoes that can tile the plane but don't fit the Conway criterion. Fascinating. It's a reminder that even our best mathematical tools sometimes encounter those curveballs that nature throws our way. Precisely. It's part of what makes this area of math so intriguing. It is. We have these rules and patterns, but there are always those exceptions that keep us on our toes. Right. Okay. So we've talked about the types of polyominoes, the counting challenge, and the complexities of tiling. But all this talk of squares and shapes is making me realize we encounter polyominoes all the time in our everyday lives. You absolutely do. They pop up in puzzles and games more often than you might think. Well, we've already mentioned Tetris, which is probably the most famous example. Right. What else? There's Blokus, a board game where players compete to fit as many of their polyomino pieces onto the board as possible. Oh, okay. It uses all the free polyominoes up to size 5. So it's a great way to get a hands-on feel for how these shapes work together. What about those Sudoku variations that use funky-shaped regions instead of the usual 3x3 squares? You're right. Some Sudoku puzzles use regions shaped like nonominoes, which are polyominoes made of nine squares. Okay. It adds a whole new layer of spatial reasoning to the classic number puzzle. It's amazing how these simple shapes find their way into so many different contexts. It is. It makes you wonder if the game designers were secretly mathematicians in disguise
