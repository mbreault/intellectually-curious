## Description

From Henning Brandâ€™s urine distillation in 1669 to Robert Boyleâ€™s practical chemistry, this episode traces phosphorusâ€™s wild history and surprising versatility. Weâ€™ll explore its four allotropesâ€”white, red, violet, and blackâ€”and why phosphorus sits at the heart of life, industry, and the global food system. Along the way we uncover the elementâ€™s intimate ties to DNA, its darkly dramatic uses, and the looming peak phosphorus challenge shaping research and policy today.

## Transcript

All right, buckle up, because today we're diving into the fascinating world of phosphorus, an element with a past so wild it'll make your head spin. And a present and future that are equally mind-blowing, I have to say. We're talking secret societies, a rather unexpected key ingredient, and discoveries that literally illuminated the scientific world. It's a story of how something most people probably never even think about, this element phosphorus, is both deeply intimate, like woven into our very DNA, and a potential global concern, with this idea of peak phosphorus looming on the horizon. Okay, so we've got a lot to unpack here. Let's start with, well, the beginning. The year is 1669. Picture this, you're Henning Brand, an alchemist on a quest for the ultimate prize, the Philosopher's Stone. The Philosopher's Stone? Ah, yes, the mythical substance that could transform base metals into gold. It was a time when alchemy and early chemistry were closely intertwined, you see. Right, like this mystical blend of science and magic, almost. Exactly. The idea of transmuting matter, of unlocking hidden connections within the very fabric of existence, it captured the imaginations of many. And in Brand's case, this quest for the legendary Philosopher's Stone led him to a rather, shall we say, unconventional source, human urine. Now, as strange as that might sound to our modern ears, back then, urine was considered philosophically potent. Philosophically potent. Okay, you're going to have to break that down for me. Well, it was seen as containing the essence of life itself, you see. It was believed to hold a kind of inherent power. I see, so not just, well, wastes. Not at all. It was considered a potential key to unlocking the secrets of matter, at least in the alchemical worldview. So instead of, you know, a fancy lab, Brand gathers over 50 buckets of urine. 50 buckets. That's dedication to the cause. I can't even imagine the aroma. I can only imagine it was quite pungent. He starts distilling this, let's call it a unique concoction. And what happens? He stumbles upon a substance that glows in the dark. It wasn't exactly a sudden aha moment, but it was certainly a startling discovery. Imagine that you're distilling, well, you know, and suddenly things start to glow. It was a moment that challenged the very understanding of matter at the time. Imagine his surprise when he isolated this waxy white substance. This glowing goo. It had this otherworldly glow, and even more surprisingly, it would ignite when exposed to air. Talk about a laboratory hazard. It was both fascinating and dangerous, this substance he called phosphorous mirabilis, the miraculous bearer of light. Miraculous, maybe, but I bet storing it was a nightmare. Absolutely. White phosphorous, the form Brand isolated, is incredibly reactive. Like, really reactive. Even small amounts exposed to air can spontaneously combust. That's precisely why it later found use in, shall we say, less than peaceful applications. Okay, so we've got glowing, combustible goo. But wait, the story gets even better. While Brand is busy with his unique experiments, across the English Channel, another brilliant mind was on the trail of this elusive element, Robert Boyle. Ah, Robert Boyle, a true giant of science. Yeah. Unlike Brand, Boyle was moving away from the mystical aspects of alchemy and towards a more, what we would recognize today as a scientific approach. He was a meticulous experimenter. A stickler for the scientific method. Precisely. And thank goodness for that, right? So Boyle, working independently, also manages to isolate phosphorus. And get this, he even refines the process, figures out that using sand could make the reaction more controlled, less likely to, you know, spontaneously combust. He was a pioneer in developing what we now call chemistry, a systematic approach to understanding the elements and their interactions. So we've gone from glowing pee to controlled reactions only with phosphorus, am I right? But hold on, this whole urine thing still has me a bit baffled. How did Brand even get phosphorus in the first place? It wasn't magic, I promise. It was a bit of fortunate chemistry at play. Fortunate chemistry. It turns out that urine naturally contains phosphates specifically, ammonium, sodium, hydrogen phosphate. Okay, phosphates, I vaguely remember those from high school chemistry. Something about fertilizers, right? You're on the right track. And this, my friend, this ammonium, sodium, hydrogen phosphate was the key ingredient Brand unknowingly isolated during his quest for the philosopher's stone. So it was the phosphates all along. Who knew that something, well, something we usually flush away held such a secret? It just goes to show, sometimes the most remarkable discoveries are hiding in plain sight. It just goes to show that the most remarkable discoveries are often hiding in plain sight. So we've gone from glowing pee to controlled reactions, and it all comes back to phosphorus. But to really grasp what makes this element so special, we need to zoom out, look at the bigger picture, which brings us to the periodic table. Ah, yes, the periodic table. The grand organizer of elements. If you have the excerpt we provided handy, you'll find phosphorus sitting pretty at number 15, represented by the letter P. Element number 15, phosphorus. Crabbell. Got it. But it's not just hanging out solo, right? It's part of a group. You're right. It's part of a group of elements with a bit of a tongue twister of a name, the Nictogens. That's group 15 on the periodic table. Nictogens. Okay, I'll admit, the only one from that group I really recognize is nitrogen, you know, crucial for plants, the air we breathe, the basics. Is it a coincidence that it's in the same group as phosphorus, or is there something more to it? It's definitely not a coincidence. Phosphorus and nitrogen, they're like two peas in a pod, chemically speaking. They share some remarkable similarities. Both are essential for life as we know it, and both can form these incredibly diverse compounds with, and this is where it gets really interesting, vastly different properties. Wait, so you're saying, depending on how phosphorus is structured, what other elements it's hanging out with, it can completely change its behavior? Kind of like, oh, I don't know, a chameleon changing its colors. That's a great analogy. Just like a chameleon adapts to its surroundings, phosphorus adapts its properties depending on its chemical company. It all comes down to how the atoms are arranged, how they bond with other elements. Okay, so the building blocks are the same, but how they're put together makes all the difference. So what kind of different personalities are we talking about here? Give me some examples of how phosphorus can transform. Well, we've already met one of its more, shall we say, flamboyant personalities, white phosphorus. The one Henning Brand discovered, the one that glows and spontaneously combusts. Talk about a dramatic entrance. Yeah, not exactly the kind of element you want to invite over for a quiet cup of tea, is it? But seriously, these different forms, these personalities, they have a name, right? Something about allotropes. Refresh my memory. What are allotropes again? You've got it. Allotropes. That's the scientific term for these different forms of the same element. Think of them like different outfits for the same actor, each outfit allowing them to play a different role. Okay, so it's like phosphorus has a whole wardrobe of costumes, each giving it special abilities. So we've got white phosphorus, the dangerous one. What other outfits does phosphorus like to wear? Well, on the tamer side, there's red phosphorus. This one's much more stable, more predictable. In fact, this is the workhorse you'd find in the safety strip on matchboxes. You strike it against a rough surface, and boom, fire. Wait, so the matchhead itself isn't a ticking time bomb in my pocket. It's the red phosphorus on the box that needs that friction, that spark, to get the party started. You got it. Red phosphorus is all about controlled combustion. It needs a bit of persuasion to ignite, unlike its more reactive cousin, white phosphorus. Okay, that's reassuring to know. So white phosphorus, a bit of a wild child. Red phosphorus, much more dependable. Are there any other notable phosphorus personalities, or should I say allotropes, we should meet? Okay, so we've got white phosphorus, a bit of a wild child. Red phosphorus, much more dependable. Are there any other notable phosphorus personalities, or should I say allotropes, we should meet? We've got a couple more to round out the phosphorus family. There's violet phosphorus, which, as you might have guessed, gets its name from its, well, violet color. Makes sense. And then there's black phosphorus, which is kind of the cool cousin. It's actually stable, and get this, it conducts electricity. Conducts electricity, really? That's wild. I thought phosphorus was all about, you know, glowing and fires. Right. It's amazing, isn't it? Black phosphorus, it actually behaves more like graphite, the stuff in your pencil, than its other phosphorus siblings. It just goes to show how much variety you can get with just one element, all based on how those atoms decide to arrange themselves. From glowing to conducting electricity, it's like phosphorus has a split personality. Or maybe it's more like a multi-talented performer with a whole range of acts. I like that, a multi-talented performer. And we haven't even gotten to its most impressive act yet, phosphorus's role in life itself. Right, you mentioned that earlier. Okay, so we've covered glowing pee, matchboxes, even pencils. How in the world does phosphorus go from those things to
