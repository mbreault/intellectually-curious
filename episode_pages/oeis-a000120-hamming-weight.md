## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into the world of the OEIS. And today we're going to be exploring A00012 Nero, the Hemingway sequence. Ooh, very nice. It might seem deceptively simple at first glance, but trust me, for number theory students like you, this one is a goldmine of intriguing connections. Absolutely. So this sequence, I mean, it might just be counting the number of ones in the binary representation of a number, but its tendrils reach out far and wide, touching on concepts like binomial coefficients, Pascal's triangle, and even fractal geometry. Okay, so let's break it down a little bit. If we take the number five as an example, its binary form is 101, meaning its Hemingway is straightforward enough, right? Yes. But where does the fascination lie? Well, the beauty is in the connections it reveals. Okay. For instance, consider Pascal's triangle. Okay. The nth row in Pascal's triangle has a very specific number of distinct odd binomial coefficients, and that number is directly related to the Hemingway of n. So if we look at row five of Pascal's triangle, one, five, ten, ten, five, one, it has two distinct odd numbers, one and five. That's right. And the Hemingway of five, as we just saw, is two. Is that the connection? Precisely. The number of distinct odd binomial coefficients in a row is two raised to the power of k, where k is one less than the Hemingway of the row number. In this case, k is one, two minus one. And two raised to the power of one is indeed two. That's pretty remarkable. It is. It makes you wonder why this relationship exists. Yeah. Is it just a coincidence? Or is there a deeper mathematical reason? That's a question that has intrigued mathematicians for a while. It suggests that the binary representation of a number, something seemingly basic, is fundamentally linked to combinatorial properties, as seen in Pascal's triangle. It hints at a deeper underlying structure we might not fully grasp yet. Wow. This OEIS entry also mentions a recursive pattern for generating the sequence. Yes. It's quite elegant. Okay. If you know the first two to the k terms, you simply add one to each to generate the next two to the k terms. Okay. For example, starting with zero, adding one gives you one. Then you take those two terms, zero, one, and add one to each, resulting in one, two. Gotcha. You repeat this process to build the entire sequence. And this recursive generation, this is what leads to the fractal nature of the Hemingway sequence, right? Exactly. The way it builds upon itself in this repetitive manner is a hallmark of fractal patterns. Okay. If you remove every other term, you're left with the original sequence. Wow. And you can keep doing that indefinitely, always revealing the same underlying structure. That's incredible. It is quite fascinating. So we're seeing connections to binomial coefficients, Pascal's triangle, and now fractals. It really emphasizes how interconnected seemingly different areas of mathematics can be. Absolutely. And we're just getting started. Another intriguing connection lies with Gould's sequence. Gould's sequence. Yes. I'm familiar with the concepts, but how does it relate to the Hemingway sequence? Well, here's where it gets interesting. Okay. If you take the binary logarithm of each term in Gould's sequence, you end up with the corresponding term in the Hemingway sequence. Okay. Let's take 12 as an example. In Gould's sequence, it can be represented as 2 to the 3rd plus 2 squared. Right, or 8 plus 4. Exactly. Okay. And the binary logarithm of 12 would be 3. Right, the highest power of 2 that fits into it. Precisely. So the 3rd term in the Hemingway sequence should also be related to... Wait a minute, the 3rd term is 2. You got it. Wow. This connection reveals how the Hemingway sequence essentially unveils the underlying structure of Gould's sequence. By highlighting the highest power of 2 involved in its representation, it's a beautiful example of how seemingly disparate sequences can be intimately related. This is already so much more than just counting ones in binary. I can see why you said it's a goldmine for number theory students. And we haven't even touched on its connections to mystery calculator sequences or Diophantine equations yet. There's much more to uncover in our deep dive. These mystery calculator sequences, they sound particularly intriguing. They are. How does the Hemingway sequence appear in something like that? Imagine playing around with a calculator. Okay. Repeatedly performing an operation like taking the square root or calculating a factorial. Yeah. Sometimes the number of times a specific result appears in these sequences is directly linked to its Hemingway. So there's a potential connection between the seemingly arbitrary calculator games and this fundamental concept of binary weight. Absolutely. Could you give an example? Certainly. Let's consider a simple example. Okay. Start with the number 7 and repeatedly take its factorial. You'd get 7, 5,040, a very large number, and so on. Now let's count how many times the digit 0 appears at the end of each result. Okay. For 7, there are no trailing zeros. Okay. For 5,040, there's one. As you keep going, you'll find that the number of trailing zeros relates to the Hemingway of the original number. That's a surprising connection. It is. It suggests that the Hemingway isn't just a theoretical concept, but something that can manifest in really unexpected ways. Yeah. These calculator sequences are well-studied. There's still much to uncover. Right. They offer a playground for number theory enthusiasts to experiment and potentially discover new patterns related to the Hemingway sequence. You also mentioned a connection to Diophantine equations. Yes. For our listeners who might need a refresher, could you briefly explain what those are? A Diophantine equation is an equation where we are specifically looking for integer solutions. Right. So instead of allowing any number as a solution, we're constrained to using only whole numbers. Exactly. Okay. And how does the Hemingway sequence fit into this world of Diophantine equations? There's a particular Diophantine equation where the number of solutions directly corresponds to the Hemingway of a specific number within the equation. Right. While the equation itself might appear complex, the takeaway is that the Hemingway is dictating how many possible solutions exist. So it's like the Hemingway is acting as a key, unlocking the number of solutions hidden within this equation. Precisely. That's pretty remarkable. It seems like every corner we turn reveals another unexpected application of the Hemingway sequence. Exactly. It's a testament to its fundamental nature and its ability to connect seemingly disparate areas of mathematics. But there's even more. Remember how we talked about the sequence's fractal nature? Yes, the self-similarity where removing every other term gives you the original sequence back? Right. It's a pretty mind-bending concept. Well, this fractal property isn't just a mathematical curiosity. It has practical implications as well. Oh. For instance, it plays a role in certain error-correcting codes used in computer science and telecommunications. So the Hemingway sequence helps ensure that data transmitted over noisy channels arrives intact. Precisely. By understanding and leveraging its properties, we can build robust systems that can withstand errors and maintain data integrity. This is incredible. It is fascinating. We've gone from counting ones in binary to connections with Pascal's triangle, fractals, and now error-correcting codes. It's a truly versatile sequence. And we haven't even exhausted all of its connections. Oh, wow. There's still more to explore in our deep dive into the fascinating world of the Hemingway sequence. It's amazing to see how this, like, seemingly simple concept of counting ones in binary has such far-reaching applications. It is. It is. Before we wrap up, I'm curious about one thing you mentioned earlier. Yeah. The connection between the Hemingway sequence and another sequence, A06387. Yes. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? Absolutely. A06387 is like a specialized version of the Hemingway sequence. Okay. Instead of looking at the Hemingway of every number, we focus solely on the odd numbers. So it's essentially a subset of the original sequence. Yes. Focusing on the Hemingway of odd numbers only. Exactly. What kind of insights does this, like, provide? By comparing A06387 with the original Hemingway sequence, we can uncover interesting patterns and differences in the binary representation of even and odd numbers. Right. It helps us delve deeper into the nuances of how these representations influence the Hemingway. It's like we're zooming in on a specific aspect of the Hemingway sequence to gain an even finer understanding of its properties. Precisely. And it highlights a key principle in number theory. Often, specializing a problem or focusing on a subset can reveal hidden structures and patterns that might be obscured in the broader view. This deep dive has been truly enlightening. It has been fun. We've explored connections to Pascal's triangle, fractals, error-correcting codes, even Diophantine equations. Yes. It's clear that the Hemingway sequence is a fundamental concept with, like, wide-ranging significance. Absolutely. For our number theory students listening in, what key takeaways would you want them to remember? I would say the most important takeaway is recognizing the power of binary representation in number theory. The Hemingway sequence at its core is all about understanding and utilizing this representation. Right. Secondly, I hope they've gained an appreciation for how seemingly simple concepts can have profound and unexpected connections across various mathematical domains. Yeah. And finally, I'd encourage them to stay curious and explore further. Yeah. The OEIS is a treasure trove of sequences, each with its own story to tell. Well said. The Hemingway sequence serves as a perfect example of how exploration and curiosity can lead to a
