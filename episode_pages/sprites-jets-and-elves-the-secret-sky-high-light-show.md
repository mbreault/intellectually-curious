## Description

A deep dive into transient luminous eventsâ€”the spectacular, fleeting electrical discharges that light up the upper atmosphere well above thunderstorms. From sprites and blue jets to gigantic jets and elves, we explore what TLEs are, how scientists finally observe them from the ground and from space, the physics that powers them, and why these otherworldly flashes matter for our understanding of the atmosphere, aviation safety, and Earth's electrical system.

## Transcript

Imagine a massive thunderstorm, you know, the kind that rumbles the ground and lights up the night sky with brilliant flashes. Now, push that image even further. Forget the familiar lightning striking downwards or even between clouds. Instead, picture a hidden light show, a secret spectacle unfolding far, far above at the very edge of space in our planet's upper atmosphere. For decades, these were just fleeting whispers, anecdotal reports from pilots almost mythical in their rarity. But this hidden phenomenon actually has a name, transient luminous events or TLEs. And in this deep dive, we're going to pull back the curtain on these extraordinary high altitude electrical discharges. Our mission is to reveal what these TLEs are, how science has finally begun to observe and understand them, the incredible forces that create them, and maybe why their existence matters far beyond just the visual wonder. We'll explore the fascinating cast of characters in this atmospheric ballet, from the elusive to the truly gigantic. Okay, let's kick things off by making a really crucial distinction. TLEs are not your everyday lightning. When we say lightning, most of us picture bolts hitting the ground or flashing within clouds, right? But TLEs are a collective name for several types of short-lived electrical phenomena or luminous plasma that occur well above those normal thunderclouds. We're talking way higher. Typically, those clouds don't reach higher than about 15 kilometers. This is a whole different league. Precisely. We're talking about discharges happening in parts of the atmosphere that, well, you'd usually consider pretty calm, far above where planes typically fly. And there isn't just one type. There are several main kinds of TLEs, each with its own unique look and, frankly, quite stunning appearance. The most famous ones are probably sprites. Picture them as these huge, typically reddish-orange forms, although sometimes they can appear greenish-blue. Their shapes are incredibly varied. Some look like enormous jellyfish with long-hanging tendrils. People sometimes call those carrot sprites, which is quite descriptive, actually. Others are more column-like, or they have these arcing branches. Often they start with a sort of diffuse red glow, a halo, way up high, maybe with structured blue streamers forming below that. Jellyfish and carrots in the sky. Way up there. That's pretty wild. And if I remember right, they're not just strange shapes. They're absolutely enormous. Oh, absolutely enormous. Sprites develop up in the mesosphere, generally between 50 and 90 kilometers. That's about 30 to 55 miles above the Earth's surface. To give you a sense of scale, a single sprite event can span altitudes from maybe 40 kilometers all the way up to 80 kilometers. And width-wise, we're talking several tens of kilometers, sometimes as much as 30 miles across. Imagine something the size of a small city just appearing for, well, milliseconds. Wow. And you said they're different from regular lightning in terms of heat. Yes, that's a key point. Unlike traditional lightning, which is incredibly hot plasma, sprites are what we call cold plasma. Think of it less like a superhot spark and more like the gentle, sustained glow you get inside a fluorescent light tube. Electrons are excited, they produce light, but without that extreme heat. Interesting. And the name sprites, where did that come from? Ah, that's a fun little anecdote. The name sprites was actually coined by Dr. Davis Setman from the University of Alaska. He was apparently inspired by mischievous Shakespearean characters like Puck, you know? Because they were so fleeting and hard to catch on camera, he thought they were elusive and tricky. I like that. So after sprites, what else is in this TLE family? Well, then we have blue jets. As the name suggests, they're distinctively blue. That color comes from excited nitrogen gas. They look like narrow, cone-shaped jets of light shooting directly upward from the tops of thunderstorms. They reach altitudes of about 40 to 50 kilometers, so they're punching into the upper stratosphere. And they're very brief, too, usually lasting only a fraction of a second, maybe several hundred milliseconds. Okay, so blue jets shoot up pretty high. But you mentioned gigantic ones, too. What about the gigantic jets? Right, the gigantic jets. These are really the heavyweights of the jet category. They're among the brightest TLEs we see, but also the rarest, especially compared to blue jets. We tend to see them more often over oceanic thunderstorms, interestingly. They start deep within the core of a thunderstorm and rise much, much higher than blue jets. We're talking altitudes up to 70 or even 80 kilometers, sometimes reaching right into the ionosphere itself. And their upper part can actually change color, often from blue down low to red higher up. They can also last longer, nearly a full second sometimes, which is quite a long time for these events. A full second? That's practically an eternity compared to the others. Okay, so we have sprites, blue jets, gigantic jets. What else? You mentioned elves. Yes, elves. And this is probably my favorite acronym in the field. Emission of light and very low frequency perturbations due to electromagnetic pulse sources. Quite a mouthful. Elves typically look like huge, flat, expanding rings of light. Very diffuse. They can be enormous, hundreds of miles wide, sometimes up to 300 kilometers in diameter. From space, they often look like a giant donut expanding rapidly. They happen in the ionosphere, roughly 100 kilometers, about 60 miles above the ground. Maybe a bit lower, 80, 90 kilometers along the bottom edge of the ionosphere. A 300 kilometer donut of light. That's hard to even picture. You said they're fast. Incredibly fast. This is the truly mind-boggling part. Elves last less than a thousandth of a second. Faster than one millisecond. That makes them completely impossible to see with the naked eye. I mean, it's faster than a camera shutter, faster than you can blink. It's almost instantaneous. That's just, yeah, mind-boggling is the word. It sounds almost too brief to even matter. Are there even more types, more obscure ones? Indeed there are. While sprites, blue jets, gigantic jets, and elves are the ones we've studied most, scientists have identified others. There are things called halos, which are brief descending glows, maybe 40 to 70 kilometers wide, and they sometimes appear just before a sprite. And then you get into the even more obscure and rather whimsically named ones like ghosts, which are described as faint greenish globes. And even things called trolls, pixies, and gnomes. The existence and nature of these are still really being explored. It seems the more we look up there, the more complex this hidden world becomes. It's like the atmosphere has its own secret folklore. It really does sound like it. But it's clear these things are incredibly fleeting, super high up, and often hidden by the very storms creating them. So how on earth do scientists even begin to catch these? It sounds like a massive challenge, especially if some are faster than a millisecond. It absolutely was a massive challenge for a very long time. For decades, really, all we had were these intermittent verbal reports. You know, pilots flying high, sometimes reporting strange flashes above storms going back maybe even to the 19th century. But they were just anecdotes, easily dismissed. The real turning point came in 1989. It was actually quite accidental. A team from the University of Minnesota was testing a low-light television camera, pointing it at distant storms, and they just happened to capture this upward flash from the cloud tops. Serendipity. Wow. That unexpected image, that first photo of a sprite, was the eureka moment. It proved these things were real, and it really kicked off serious scientific interest and dedicated research efforts around the world. That's a fantastic story. A classic case of accidental discovery opening a whole new field. So how did they go from that one lucky shot to actually studying them systematically from the ground, especially given how fast they are? Well, ground-based observation campaigns became much more sophisticated pretty quickly. Groups like the Stanford V-ELF group, for instance, developed specialized tools. They built things like photometric array imagers. One instrument was called Piper that could actually document hundreds of elves from just a single storm system. And to capture those really fast events, like the submillisecond elves, or to see the fine details inside sprites, they had to use incredibly high-speed video cameras. We're talking cameras recording at over 1,000 frames per second, sometimes much faster. That kind of time resolution is absolutely critical for dissecting something that lasts less than a thousandth of a second. They also used telescopic imaging to zoom in and reveal these tiny bead-like structures, the streamers, propagating in the lower parts of sprites. Okay, ground-based tech got pretty advanced, but I imagine looking up through the whole atmosphere, often through clouds, must still be limiting. Space seems like the ultimate high ground for this, right? Exactly. Space-based observation became absolutely essential for getting consistent detail views. You're above the clouds, you have an unobstructed line of sight, you can cover huge areas of the planet. The International Space Station, the ISS, has been a really vital platform for this. It's equipped with advanced cameras and dedicated sensors like NASA's Lightning Imaging Sensor, or LIS, which was installed in 2017. And there's also the European Space Agency's Atmosphere Space Interactions Monitor, ASM, which was added in 2018. These instruments are giving us data we simply couldn't get from down here. So what kind of cool stuff have we actually seen from the ISS? Any big moments or firsts? Oh, several really notable ones. Back in September
