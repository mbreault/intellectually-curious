## Description

A deep dive into element 99â€”synthetic, radioactively luminous, and born from the 1952 Ivy Mike nuclear test. We'll trace its accidental discovery, the Cold War race to name it after Einstein and Fermi, the hunt for just a few atoms in debris, why it glows blue, its unusually low melting point, and how scientists study a material that decays daily and reshapes its own crystal structure.

## Transcript

All right, get ready, because today we are diving deep into the world of Einsteinium. Einsteinium! You got it. Yeah. Now, you've probably heard of it. Oh, yeah. It's named after, you know... Of course. The one and only. Albert Einstein? Albert Einstein. But it's a lot more than just a name. Oh, yeah. There's so much to unpack with this element. I mean, just the fact that it's synthetic. Exactly. It's completely synthetic. Yeah. Element 99 on the periodic table sits right there with the actinides. And it does not exist naturally. Nope, not at all. So every atom of Einsteinium that we know of was created by us. By us, that's right. And to think it all started with a bang. Literally a bang. Literally. We're talking about the Ivy Mike nuclear test back in 1952. 1952. Not exactly your typical, like, lab experiment. No, not the kind of place you'd expect to find a new element. Yes. But there it was. Set the scene for us. So picture this. The scientists, they're out there in the Pacific, right? Yeah. They're testing this massive hydrogen bomb. Right. Ivy Mike. And really, they're focused on understanding, like, the raw power of this thing. Of this weapon, yeah. Of this weapon, yeah. But when they start looking through the fallout, they find something unexpected. What's that? Plutonium-244. Okay, I gotta admit, I'm not a nuclear scientist, so why is finding Plutonium-234 such a big deal? Well, see, to make Plutonium-244, you need multiple neutron absorptions. Okay. And that's something that, at the time, was considered incredibly rare. Ah, okay. So it meant that things got way more extreme during that test than anyone had anticipated. So hotter. Hotter. That's very high energy. Higher energy, yeah. And that opened up the possibility of even heavier elements forming. Okay. And that's where Einsteinium comes in. So how do you even begin to look for a brand new element in the aftermath of a nuclear explosion? I mean, talk about an extreme scavenger hunt. Right. They flew planes with filter paper through the cloud to capture samples. Wow. Then they collected debris from the coral around the test site. That's incredible. And even then, isolating Einsteinium, that was a whole other challenge. It took them weeks of work using techniques like ion exchange to finally isolate it. And how much did they actually find? They only managed to get, like, 200 atoms. The 200 atoms. Of Einsteinium. Of Einsteinium. Specifically, Einsteinium-253. Wow. Talk about a needle in a haystack. It really is. But this is where it gets even crazier. Oh, yeah. This stuff, it glows in the dark. It does. Like, it emits visible blue light. Yeah. It's pretty wild. That's insane. Yeah. And that glow. That's a direct result of its radioactivity. Okay. It's so radioactive that it's actually damaging its own crystal structure. Wait, so it's, like, self-destructing? In a way, yes. Because it's so energetic. Yeah, it's too much energy. Wow, that is so bizarre. It is. And that energy also plays a part in its really low melting point. Okay, so how low are we talking? Einsteinium melts at just 860 degrees Celsius. Okay. Which is way lower than a lot of the elements around it. Okay, so compared to, like, elements around it on the periodic table. Yeah, like californium. Californium, yeah. Which melts at 900 degrees. Okay. And then you've got fermium, which melts at 1527 degrees. Okay, so it's a significant difference. Yeah, it's quite a jump. So we've got Einsteinium, rare, glows in the dark, low melting point, self-destructing. Yeah. I mean, it's definitely living up to its reputation, but... It's quite a character. Yeah, it is. But that also makes it really hard to study. Oh. I mean, you've got the short half-life. Einsteinium-253, right? Yeah, just over 20 days. Yeah. And then you've got the self-damage from the radiation. And we're talking minuscule quantities here. Right, so it's like a constant race against time. Oh, absolutely. Because it's decaying. It's decaying. Yeah. Into berkelium and then californium. Right, so even if you had, like, a pure sample, it wouldn't stay pure for very long. It's constantly changing. Yeah. About 3% of it decays into berkelium-249 every single day. Wow. And then that further decays into californium-249. Wow, so how do scientists even begin to study something that's literally changing before their eyes? That's a great question, and we'll get into that after a quick break. All right, we'll be right back. So, Einsteinium, this glowing, self-destructing metal, it's pretty wild. It is pretty wild. But it sounds like it's really hard to study. It's incredibly challenging. So, like, how do scientists, how do they even begin to... Well, they have to come up with some pretty creative techniques. I bet, yeah. Sometimes they'll take measurements immediately after a process called thermal annealing. Okay. And that helps minimize the effects of the self-radiation damage. So they're kind of like resetting it? In a way, yeah. Wow. And other times, you know, they study certain compounds of Einsteinium under specific atmospheres to try and slow down the decay. Ah, okay. And there are even techniques that use lasers. Wow, lasers. Yeah, to excite specific Einsteinium ions. Okay. And that allows them to observe very specific properties. That's pretty amazing. It is. Like, I just can't believe... It's remarkable what they've been able to learn. Yeah, I mean... Given all the hurdles. Right, given all the hurdles. Yeah. Okay, so... It's quite a testament to human ingenuity. Totally. Now, you mentioned before that the discovery of Einsteinium wasn't exactly a solo effort, right? It was another team. There was another team. That was hot on the trail. Yeah, a team at the Nobel Institute for Physics in Sweden. Okay. They were also synthesizing heavy elements around the same time. Okay. And they actually managed to synthesize lighter isotopes of fermium. Oh, wow. Which is element 100. Okay, so they were right there. They were right there with them. Wow. Yeah. So, I mean, how did the American team end up getting the naming rights for Einsteinium? It really came down to timing. Okay. So even though their findings were initially classified... Because of the Cold War. Because of the Cold War, that's right. Yeah. The American team, they published their results first. Ah. And that's how they earned the right to propose the names. Like Einsteinium and fermium. Einsteinium and fermium, yeah. In honor of... In honor of Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi. I mean, what a story. It's pretty incredible. Yeah, like an accidental discovery during a nuclear test? Mm-hmm. This scientific race against time. Yeah. A glowing, self-destructing metal. Yeah, it's got it all. It's got it all. It's like something out of science fiction. It really does. But beyond the spectacle, it's really fascinating to delve into... Absolutely. ...like the actual properties of this element. It's more than just a spectacle. There's some real science there. So let's talk about that. Okay, let's do it. So Einsteinium, you said it's a soft, silvery metal. It is. And it glows because of the intense radioactivity. We talked about that. The glow is just one of the visual demonstrations of its... Of its radioactivity, right? Yeah, of its intense radioactivity. And we talked about the low melting point. Right. But here's another curveball. Okay, hit me. It's less dense than californium. That's right. And californium is the element right before it. On the periodic table? Yeah, so you'd think, right, like as you move down the periodic table... You'd assume. Things just get denser. Yeah, generally. Yeah. But Einsteinium breaks a mold. Einsteinium likes to be different. Yeah, it does. So yeah, it's less dense than californium. So what does that actually... What does that mean? So it means that its density is actually closer to homeum, which is the element directly above it on the periodic table. So it's lighter than we would expect? Lighter than expected. Okay, so it's lighter than expected. It melts easily. Yeah. What about its structure? Ah, now that's where things get really interesting. Okay, lay it on me. So most of the lighter actinides, like californium, berkelium, curium, americium... Okay. They have a double hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. Okay, at room temperature. But Einsteinium, it's got its own thing going on. Does it? It does. What does it have? So while research is still ongoing, it appears that Einsteinium has a face-centered cubic structure at room temperature. At room temperature. Some reports suggest there might be a hexagonal phase, but it seems like it transitions to the face-centered cubic structure when it's heated. Oh, okay, so it could be both. It could be both. We're not entirely sure yet. Yeah. But, you know, with Einsteinium, everything is in constant flux. It's always changing. Always
