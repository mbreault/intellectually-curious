We'll trace its prediction by Mendeleev, its discovery by Marguerite Perret in 1939, and how scientists study it in tiny, fleeting bursts. Learn why francium, tucked under cesium in the periodic table, is predicted to be incredibly reactive, how it's artificially created for study, and what its short 22-minute half-life reveals about the mysteries at the edge of the periodic table.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. We're diving into the world of elements today, and this one, well, it's a bit of a phantom, you could say. A phantom element sounds intriguing. Oh, it is. We're talking about francium. Francium, huh? Okay, I'm listening. You know, you sent us those Wikipedia articles, and it's clear that francium is not exactly hanging out on every street corner, right? It's like one of the rarest elements out there. Rare, you say? Rare, like less than an ounce of it exists on Earth at any given moment. Wow, that's pretty scarce. So, where do we even begin with something so elusive? How was it even discovered if it's practically invisible? Well, that's the amazing part. Francium was actually the last element to be discovered in nature, not cooked up in a lab like so many others. Really? That's fascinating. So it's out there, but barely. It's out there, but it's playing a serious game of hide and seek. And it's not just about its rarity. It's also incredibly radioactive. Ah, radioactivity. That explains the disappearing act. Exactly. It's so unstable that its most stable isotope, francium-223, has a half-life of just 22 minutes. Wait, just 22 minutes? That's incredibly short. Right. I mean, imagine trying to study something that's constantly vanishing before your eyes. That's like trying to build a sandcastle during high tide. So what happens during this half-life? Where does it go? Well, it doesn't actually disappear into thin air. It decays into other elements. Oh, I see. So it transforms. Yeah, it transforms into astatine, radium, or radon. Poof. Like magic, but with a scientific explanation. It's almost like it's playing a game of elemental hopscotch, jumping from one form to another. So even though it's naturally occurring, it's incredibly fleeting. I'm guessing no one has ever actually laid eyes on a bulk quantity of it. You got it. It's like a ghost in the world of elements there, but not there. And this is where it gets even more intriguing. More intriguing. Okay, you've got my attention. Even though we haven't seen it in bulk, scientists have some pretty good ideas about what it might look like. Really? How is that possible if we've never seen a substantial amount? It all comes down to francium's place on the periodic table. It sits right below cesium in the alkali metal family. Okay, I see where you're going with this. The periodic table is all about patterns, right? Exactly. So based on those patterns, scientists believe that if you could somehow gather enough francium, it would appear as a highly reactive metal. A highly reactive metal, huh? Even more so than cesium, which is already pretty dramatic, right? Oh, absolutely. Cesium reacts explosively with water. It's a classic demonstration in chemistry. But francium is predicted to be even more reactive. Wow. It's amazing how we can predict things like that based on its position on the periodic table. It's almost like elemental fortune telling. It's more like scientific detective work, really. And it gets even wilder. You know, francium was actually predicted before it was ever discovered. Wait, predicted? How is that even possible? Well, Dmitri Mendeleev, the mastermind behind the periodic table, had noticed these patterns in the properties of elements and their positions. Right. I remember learning about Mendeleev and his periodic table. It's like a giant map of the elements. Yeah, exactly. And just like a map can show you where undiscovered lands might be, Mendeleev's table predicted the existence of elements that hadn't been found yet. So he was able to predict francium's existence and even some of its properties just by looking at the patterns in the periodic table. That's incredible. It is. He even gave it a temporary name, eccecesium, meaning one below cesium. So how did scientists go from predicting its existence to actually finding it? Did they just stumble upon it by chance? It was a combination of brilliant deduction and meticulous observation. The discovery of francium is a testament to the power of paying attention to the smallest details. Okay, I'm all ears. Tell me about this discovery. So in 1939, a young chemist named Marguerite Perret was working at the Curie Institute in Paris. The Curie Institute. Wasn't that where Marie Curie made her groundbreaking discoveries about radioactivity? The very same. Perret was following in the footsteps of giants. She was meticulously purifying a sample of actinium-227 when she noticed something unusual. What did she find? Was it like a giant flashing sign saying new element? Not quite that dramatic, but equally significant. She observed some decay particles with surprisingly low energy levels. They just didn't match up with what she knew about actinium. So she noticed a tiny anomaly, a detail that didn't quite fit. That's remarkable. Exactly. It was that tiny discrepancy that set her on the path to discovering a brand new element. She meticulously ruled out all other possibilities. Could it be thorium, radium, lead? She went through the entire list. Wow. Talk about a scientific detective. She didn't give up until she had exhausted every other option. And that's how she finally arrived at the conclusion. She had stumbled upon element number 87, a brand new element. That's incredible. And what did she name this mysterious new element? Well, initially she called it actinium K because it was a decay product of actinium. But later she chose a name that honored her home country, francium. Francium. It's amazing how even the names of elements can tell a story. Absolutely. But finding it was just the beginning, right? The real challenge is studying something that practically disappears before you can even blink. It's like trying to study a firework after it's already exploded. How do scientists even begin to work with something so fleeting? That's where the ingenuity of science really shines. Because francium's natural lifespan is so short, scientists have to create it artificially. Artificially. So they're essentially making francium on demand. Exactly. They bombard other elements like thorium or radium with particles in a process called nuclear transmutation. Nuclear transmutation. That sounds intense. It is. But that's what it takes to create even the tiniest amounts of francium for study. And even then, they're working with minuscule quantities, often just a few atoms at a time. So they're creating francium just to watch it disappear almost immediately. What kind of information can they possibly glean from such a fleeting existence? You'd be surprised. Scientists have developed incredible techniques to study francium in those brief moments, and what they've learned is nothing short of remarkable. Okay, now I'm really curious. What have they discovered about this ghostly element? What secrets has francium revealed? That's what we'll delve into next. Get ready for more fascinating insights into the world of francium. It's really mind-boggling, isn't it? We're talking about an element that's practically a ghost, and yet we've managed to learn so much about it. It's a testament to the ingenuity and persistence of scientists, for sure. They're like detectives, piecing together clues from the tiniest traces of evidence. And those clues have painted a pretty fascinating picture of francium, even if it is a bit blurry. We've talked about its predicted properties, its radioactive decay, and the challenges of studying it. Right, we've covered a lot of ground, but there's one area we haven't really touched on yet. It's chemistry. Ah, the heart of the matter. How does francium actually behave when it interacts with other elements? It's like trying to figure out the personality of a shadow. A shadow with a very short attention span. But we can make some educated guesses, right? After all, francium belongs to the alkali metal family, and those are known for their dramatic reactions. You bet. Think back to those explosive reactions of alkali metals with water. Well, francium is predicted to be even more reactive than its siblings, like cesium and sodium. Hold on, more reactive than those? I wouldn't want to be anywhere near that experiment. But I guess with francium's short half-life, any reaction would be more like a fleeting spark than a full-blown explosion. Exactly. It's like a burst of chemical energy and then poof, gone in an instant. But even though we can't observe these reactions on a large scale, we can use what we know about the periodic table to predict how francium might behave. So it's like we're using the periodic table as a guidebook, a sort of chemical roadmap to navigate the unknown territory of francium's reactions. That's a great way to put it. And based on what we know about alkali metals, we can predict that francium would readily react with halogens like chlorine and fluorine to form salts. Francium chloride, francium fluoride. It's fascinating to think about these fleeting compounds, these chemical whispers that exist for just a fraction of a second. And speaking of whispers, there's one particular molecule that has caused quite a stir among chemists, cesium francium, or CSFR. CSFR, huh? That sounds like a mouthful. What's so special about this particular combination? Well, it has to do with a concept called electronegativity. Electronegativity, right. That rings a bell from chemistry class, but it's been a while. Maybe you could give us a quick refresher. Sure. Electronegativity is essentially a measure of how strongly an atom attracts electrons in a chemical bond. Think of it like a tug of war between atoms over those shared electrons. Okay, that makes sense. So the higher the electronegativity, the stronger the pull on those electrons. Exactly. And based on periodic trends, you'd expect cesium to be more electronegative than franc
