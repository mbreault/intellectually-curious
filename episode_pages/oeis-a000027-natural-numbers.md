Learn about OEIS A000027 Natural Numbers

## Transcript

All right, so get ready. We're going deep today. We're talking about natural numbers. Natural numbers, huh? Those really basic math things. Exactly. And you know what? You sent over some stuff from the online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. The OEIS, yeah. Right, the OEIS. And some of the Wikipedia article about natural numbers, too. And honestly, it turns out there's a lot more to these numbers than I thought. Yeah, you learn them as a kid, but there's still a bunch of surprises in there. For sure. So let's start at the beginning, I guess. What exactly are we talking about when we say natural numbers? Well, both sources basically say they're the positive integers. 1, 2, 3, and on and on. Like, that's the core of what they are. But then there's this whole thing about zero. Oh yeah, right away we run into a bit of a problem. The OEIS keeps it simple with just the positive ones. But Wikipedia says, well, sometimes people throw in zero, too. Making them the non-negative integers instead. Yeah, exactly. And then sometimes you hear people calling them counting numbers or whole numbers, but those terms get used for other stuff sometimes, too. It's a little messy, to be honest. So lesson one is, even the definition of natural numbers isn't quite as simple as we might think. But that's what makes this so interesting. How about we step back and look at how people first started figuring these numbers out way back when? Well, think about it. We all start with our fingers, right? Like, that's the first calculator we ever use. Then you've got things like tally marks on bones. There's that amazing Ishango bone. Did you know about that one? It's like 20,000 years old. 20,000 years? That's incredible. To think that long ago people were already trying to figure out this stuff? It really puts things in perspective. And from there we start to see different ways of writing numbers. The ancient Egyptians had these cool hieroglyphs for different powers of 10. Ah, yeah. That's so different from how we think about numbers now. And then the Babylonians used a base 60 system, right? Can you imagine that? Same symbol for 1 and 60. It really shows you how many different ways there are to think about quantity. And of course a big step was figuring out zero as a concept and then as an actual number. Oh yeah, zero. Like, we use it all the time now, but it had to come from somewhere. Right. The Babylonians had this kind of placeholder idea around 700 BCE. But the Olmec and Maya civilizations actually had the concept of zero as a number way earlier. It wasn't until Brahmagupta in 628 CE that zero really became a part of math the way we use it today. So we've got fingers, tally marks, and all these different ways of writing numbers. Then zero pops up. What comes next? Well, things get really interesting with the philosophers. You've got people like Pythagoras and Archimedes, and they were thinking about numbers in a whole different way. Like, not just for counting stuff, but as these abstract ideas to explore on their own. And get this, some Greeks didn't even think 1 was a number. Wait, seriously? 1 wasn't a number? That's so weird. I know, right? Shows you how these things we take for granted were actually debated for a long time. And those debates kept going too. Like, in the 19th century, you've got PoincarÃ© talking about the power of the mind to think about things repeating forever. So infinity. Yeah, exactly. And then there's Kronecker, who said God made the integers, all else is the work of man. Wow. So even something as basic as natural numbers can lead to some pretty deep philosophical questions about what math even is. It really can. And all that debate kind of pushed people to come up with more rigorous definitions, which is where we get things like piano axioms, which are basically rules for how natural numbers work. And then set theoretic definitions, which use sets to represent each number. So from counting on our fingers to these whole systems of rules, the journey of natural numbers is kind of mind blowing. But there's more to them than just history and definitions, right? What about the cool things they do, the patterns they make? Oh yeah, totally. The OEIS entry is awesome for that. It's full of all sorts of interesting little facts and connections you wouldn't expect. Okay, give me an example. What kind of stuff are we talking about? Well, for instance, did you know that if you write out the natural numbers diagonally in a rectangle, it makes this visual pattern? And it connects to triangular numbers too. Hold on, let me picture that. Okay, yeah, I see. It's like there's a code hiding in the sequence or something. Exactly. And that's just one thing. The OEIS entry also talks about how there's a connection to the golden ratio. You know, the one represented by the Greek letter tau. Turns out there's this function that uses tau, and it only gives you the natural number sequence if you plug in tau or negative tau. It's this weird link between these totally different ideas. Oh wow, the golden ratio. That's not something I would have thought about with natural numbers. And then there's also the fact that every single natural number can be written as the product of some power of two and an odd number. Super simple, but kind of cool when you think about it. Yeah, that one's neat. I never really thought about it that way before. And then Wikipedia mentions some other cool properties. Like natural numbers are well-ordered. Did you know that? Well-ordered? What does that even mean? It means that no matter what set of natural numbers you pick, there will always be a smallest one. It's like guaranteed. No matter how random the numbers are, one of them will always be smaller than all the others. Huh, okay. That's a little trippy when you really think about it. It is. And then there's the idea of division with remainder. You know, like when one natural number doesn't divide evenly into another, you always end up with a specific quotient and a specific remainder. Every time. It's like basic elementary school math, right? Totally. But that idea is what gives us algorithms like the Euclidean algorithm, which is how you find the greatest common divisor between two numbers. So from ancient ways of writing numbers to the golden ratio to division with remainders, natural numbers are full of surprises. And it feels like we're just scratching the surface, you know? Oh yeah, definitely. And things get even wilder when we start looking at how to go beyond those basic counting numbers, like into generalizations and extensions. Okay, now you've got me really curious. What's out there beyond what we usually think of as natural numbers? Well, imagine taking the idea of natural numbers and pushing it further into things like cardinal and ordinal numbers. They let us talk about the size and order of sets, even when those sets are infinite. Wait, hold on. Are we talking about infinity now? Because that's a whole other thing. We are. It's how we can actually think about the size and order of infinite sets in a rigorous way. Super cool stuff. Okay, I'm hooked. Tell me more. Are there even more, like, abstract things beyond that? There are. We could get into things like Skolem's non-standard model of arithmetic and hypernatural numbers, but those are for another deep dive, I think. Those are where things get seriously weird. Okay, I'm adding those to the list. We could spend hours just talking about those. But for now, maybe we should take a minute to think about everything we've already seen about these supposedly simple numbers. So after all that, what's the one thing our listeners should really understand about natural numbers? So we've gone from, like, counting on our fingers to ancient Egypt to, like, the edge of infinity. That's a lot. What do you think is the most important thing to understand about all this? I think the big thing is natural numbers aren't just for counting, you know? They're, like, fundamental to all of math. They have this crazy history and all these weird properties, and they connect to these really deep ideas. It's like repealing back layers of an onion, right? Every layer, there's more to it than we thought. Like, we started with just counting. Then these ancient civilizations, then all these philosophical debates, then bam, infinity. Exactly. And that journey is what makes this so interesting, you know? It shows how these numbers, even though they seem simple, they've been making people think really hard for, like, centuries. And that's how we get new ideas in math, how we understand more and more. So the big picture is natural numbers are way more than just numbers, right? But what about the little details? What from these articles really stuck with you? Honestly, that connection to the golden ratio, that was wild. It's like, who would have thought? It shows you how these totally different parts of math can just, like, come together in these unexpected ways. It's like, there's always something new to find, even in stuff you think you already know. Totally agree. It's like finding a secret passage in your own house or something. But before we get too lost in the golden ratio, what about that quote? Kronecker, right? God made the integers. All else is the work of man. What do you think he meant by that, especially with everything we're talking about with natural numbers? Oh, yeah, that quote. People have been arguing about that one forever. I mean, in a way, he seems to be saying that natural numbers are, like, more real or
