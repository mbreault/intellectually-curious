## Description

A Nobel laureate explains how a trained cheese master uses a precise tap to listen for internal structure, uniformity, and potential flaws in Parmigiano-Reggiano without cutting. We compare this artisanal acoustic check with modern non-destructive methods like X-ray imaging and explore how traceability and broader sensory evaluation fit into authentic, high-quality cheese.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone, to The Science Corner. This is our series for, well, people like us, curious amateur scientists exploring the science behind everyday things. Glad to be here. Today, we're doing a deep dive into something maybe you've seen, the art of tapping Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Ah, yes, the tapping. It looks so simple, almost, I don't know, ritualistic. But there's real science under the surface, isn't there? How does that little tap tell us so much? That really is the core question. It's definitely not just for show. It's a highly developed auditory inspection technique. Auditory inspection. Yeah, honed over, you know, generations. It gives a non-destructive peek inside the cheese wheel. Guiding us through this is, well, we're incredibly fortunate to have a Nobel laureate with us today whose work actually touches on these very principles. Welcome. Thank you. Happy to discuss it. So you said auditory inspection. What exactly is the cheese master listening for when they tap that wheel? What information comes back? Okay, so think of it like this. They're listening for the quality of the sound. It's nuances. Nuances. Ideally, you want a sound that's consistent, resonant. It suggests the inside is uniform, aged properly. Like tapping a solid wall. Exactly, that's a good analogy. Like a well-built brick wall. Tap it, get a clear, solid tone. Right. But if there are issues inside the cheese, maybe weird protein clumps, uneven moisture, or actual voids, little gaps, those things disrupt the sound waves traveling through. So the sound might become duller or hollow or just less resonant. Ah, I see. And those acoustic variations, they flag potential textural problems. Yeah. Anomalies that, you know, affect the final quality. So the cheese is kind of talking back in a way. And the cheese master understands the language, that brick wall idea really clicks. Precisely. Now what about the tool? That little hammer? We've probably all seen clips of it. Is it just any small hammer? It looks kind of, well, tiny. Yes, tiny perhaps, but its design is very specific. The size, the material, it's all deliberate. Oh, really? Absolutely. It's built to deliver just enough force to create those sound waves effectively through a big, dense wheel of cheese. Without damaging it. Exactly, without causing damage. If the hammer were too big or too heavy, it could actually overwhelm or mask those subtle sound differences they're listening for. Right, you just hear the thump. Pretty much. Yeah. So it's really a precision instrument tailored for this specific kind of acoustic analysis. Fascinating. How tradition kind of naturally optimizes the tool for the job. Now thinking about this, you know, very hands-on, sound-based method, how does it fit with the more, let's say, lab-based scientific quality control we see today? We looked at a source, Control of Cheese Quality, that really dug into how complex just defining quality is. That's a really important connection to make. Defining cheese quality is multifaceted, isn't it? Definitely. It ranges from, you know, what the consumer experiences, taste, smell, how it feels in the mouth. Sensory stuff. Right. All the way to the cheese's underlying structure, its chemistry, its physical properties. Tapping gives us insight into some of those internal structural aspects. The uniformity. So as that source pointed out, ensuring quality needs, well, several approaches. You need sensory checks and objective measurements. Tapping is a valuable, non-destructive sensory input about what's happening inside. And that non-destructive part seems crucial. These wheels are huge, they're valuable. Immensely valuable, both in terms of cost and the time invested in aging them. You can't just be cutting them open left and right to check. Exactly. Imagine the waste, the cost. Tapping is efficient. It's reliable for getting a sense of internal consistency without sacrificing the product. It makes me think about other non-destructive methods. We saw some research, for instance, using X-rays to look inside Swiss-type cheeses to monitor the eyes forming. It's not Parmigiano-Reggiano, obviously, different structure, but it's that same idea, right? Seeing inside without cutting. That's a great parallel. X-ray analysis is another window into non-destructive assessment. In that Swiss cheese research, they used X-ray imaging to literally watch those gas bubbles, the eyes, develop over time, even when they overlapped. How did they do that? The overlapping bit sounds tricky. Well, it involves image processing. First, they pre-processed the image, basically make it black-and-white cheese versus eye. Then they used algorithms, often based on shape recognition, like match filtering, to detect the circular eyes and measure their size and number. Wow! Okay. So yeah, tapping gives you an audio picture of the inside. X-ray gives a visual one. Different tools, different cheeses sometimes, but same goal. Check internal quality without damage. And just quickly, those eyes in Swiss cheese, they come from bacteria making gas during ripening, right? Correct. Specific bacteria produce gas, typically carbon dioxide, which gets trapped as the cheese structure sets. The size, the number, the distribution of those eyes are key quality markers for those types of cheese. So even though Parmigiano doesn't have those big eyes, tapping could potentially pick up on unwanted gas pockets. It could, yes. If there were abnormal gas formation, maybe due to the wrong kind of microbial activity or problems in fermentation, tapping might reveal that as an inconsistency, a hollow sound, perhaps. So it indirectly connects to the microbial processes too. That's a really neat link. Okay, something else about Parmigiano-Reggiano, the strict rules, the traceability. Each wheel marked, you know exactly where and when it was made. How does that fit with quality control? Oh, it's fundamental. Those regulations, the whole traceability system, they're pillars of ensuring that consistent high quality. Right. If you can trace every single wheel back to its origin, the dairy, the date, even the specific vat, then if a quality issue does pop up, you can pinpoint where and when it might've started. It allows for targeted corrections in the process. It builds accountability. A whole system. A whole system, exactly. Quality is tracked constantly. Tapping then becomes sort of a final check performed by an expert within this very controlled framework. Like the human touch, the experienced ear validating everything else. We saw in the control of cheese quality source how expert assessors use all their senses, sight, smell, touch, taste. How does the very specific auditory check of tapping compare to that broader sensory evaluation? Tapping is highly specialized, isn't it? It's zeroed in on one thing, using sound to judge internal structure, integrity. Okay. The broader sensory evaluation done by those official assessors is more holistic. They're looking at appearance, feeling the texture, smelling the aroma, tasting the flavor profile, assessing the overall cheese against established standards, thinking about what the consumer will experience. So different jobs, both important. Precisely. Tapping gives that deep, though maybe narrow, structural insight. The wider sensory panel confirms the overall character and quality according to the official specifications. Both are vital for guaranteeing that authentic Parmigiano-Reggiano quality. This has been really illuminating. So pulling it all together. Yeah. This simple tap isn't simple at all. Not at all. It's a refined, non-destructive acoustic technique. Cheese masters use their experienced ears to listen for internal structural integrity, picking up potential flaws you just can't see. That's a great summary. It's this blend of age-old tradition, but it's grounded in the science of sound, the science of how cheese matures. And it works alongside all the other scientific checks and broader sensory tests. Exactly right. It's a beautiful example of how traditional craft often incorporates deep scientific principles, maybe without always calling them science. Yeah. That trained ear is like a highly sensitive biological instrument, decoding acoustic signals to understand the hidden story inside the wheel. A story written by ingredients, microbes, and time. It really makes you wonder, doesn't it? How many other practices in food making, things passed down, maybe look simple on the surface, but actually rely on some fascinating science we don't always recognize? A very interesting thought. Plenty to explore there. Definitely food for thought. Thank you so much for sharing your expertise today. This has been fantastic. Really shed light on the science behind the tap. The pleasure was all mine. A fascinating topic.
