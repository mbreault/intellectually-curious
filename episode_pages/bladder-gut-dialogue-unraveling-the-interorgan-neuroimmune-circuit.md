## Description

A deep dive into a groundbreaking communication pathway between organs: how inflammation in the bladder can heighten gut sensitivity without inflammation in the colon, via a shared network of sensory neurons. We explore a mouse model of ICPS, LL37-induced bladder inflammation, constipation-like gut changes, and increased colonic sensitivity, then reveal how retrograde tracing uncovers dual bladder/colon neurons in dorsal root ganglia and how in vivo calcium imaging confirms their functional role. Join us as we unpack the implications for ICPS and IBS comorbidity and what this could mean for future therapies.

## Transcript

It's amazing, isn't it, how interconnected everything is in the human body? Oh, absolutely. You know, we often think of our organs as these separate entities, like the heart does this, the lungs do that. Right, working independently. Exactly. But what if, and this is a fascinating concept, what if a problem in one part of your body, like say your bladder, could actually make you more sensitive to pain in a completely different area, like your gut? You're hitting on a really intriguing area of research, and actually, that's exactly what we're diving deep into today. Perfect. There's this emerging understanding of what's being called an interorgan neuroimmune circuit. Ooh, I like the sound of that. Yeah. It basically describes how inflammation in one of these internal organs, what we call visceral organs, can lead to a heightened sensitivity to pain in another one, even if that second organ doesn't show any signs of inflammation itself. Okay, so we're talking about like the bladder and the colon, two seemingly unrelated organs. But we know clinically that conditions like interstitial cystitis, ICPS, and irritable bowel syndrome, IBS, often occur together, right? You're absolutely right. The co-occurrence of ICPS and IBS is a well-documented phenomenon. In fact, some estimates suggest that between 30 and 75 percent of people with ICPS also experience symptoms that are very much like IBS. That's a huge overlap. It is. And it's something that has puzzled researchers and clinicians for a long time. So the big question has always been why? Why are these two conditions so often linked? What were some of the prevailing theories before this new research came along? Well, a lot of the thinking focused on these sort of global or systemic factors. So things like, you know, hormones that circulate throughout the body. Perhaps they were somehow playing a role in amplifying pain signals. Or maybe there was some kind of miscommunication happening within the central nervous system, you know, the brain and the spinal cord. Right, the control center. Exactly. The idea being that the brain might be misinterpreting pain signals from one area and kind of spreading that hypersensitivity to another. But this new research, what we're diving into today, points to something much more direct, doesn't it? It does. This research proposes a very exciting new hypothesis that there's actually a direct line of communication, a dedicated pathway, if you will, between these peripheral organs like the bladder and the colon. And that this communication is driven by these neuroimmune interactions happening locally, right there in the periphery, not necessarily involving the brain or hormones in a major way. This is really interesting stuff. So how did the researchers set out to explore this idea of bladder inflammation leading to problems in the gut? Did they like poke a bladder and then watch the colon? Well, not quite poking. Okay. But they did use a mouse model, very cleverly designed to mirror what we see in humans with ICPS. Okay. So what they did was they introduced this antimicrobial peptide called LL37 into the bladders of these mice. LL37 and why is that significant? Well, LL37 has been found in elevated levels in the urine of people with ICPS. Oh, interesting. So it's thought to be a trigger for the inflammation and pain that characterize that condition. So by putting it into the mouse bladders, they were essentially inducing an ICPS-like state. Exactly. They were creating a model that allowed them to study those early events, the mechanisms that might be driving the connection between bladder inflammation and the gut issues. And what did they observe? When they induced this bladder inflammation in the mice, what happened? Well, first of all, in the bladder itself, as expected, they saw classic signs of ICPS. Okay. So the mice started showing increased sensitivity to touch in the pelvic area. They call that allodynia. Oh, okay. Which basically means that even light touch is perceived as painful. They also saw edema, swelling in the bladder wall. And there was this infiltration of immune cells, these PMNs or polymorphonuclear leukocytes. PMNs. Yeah, those are the first responders, the hallmark of active inflammation. Oh, okay. And of course, the mice also exhibited urinary urgency, needing to pee more frequently. And very importantly, they became much more sensitive to their bladders being filled or distended. Right. Makes sense. The researchers actually measured this by looking at what are called visceromotor responses or VMRs, which are basically reflex contractions of the abdominal muscles that happen when an organ is stretched. So it's like a measurable physical response to that internal discomfort? Exactly. A way to quantify the sensitivity. So the bladder is clearly in distress. But what about the colon? Did it show the same kind of inflammatory response? And this is where it gets really fascinating. Despite the fact that there was all this inflammation going on in the bladder, the researchers found no signs of inflammation whatsoever in the colons of these mice. Really? Yeah. And not only that, the lining of the gut, what we call the epithelial barrier, remained completely intact. No leaks, no changes in permeability. So no direct inflammation in the colon, yet we know that these gut problems are often present in people with bladder issues. How did the researchers reconcile this? How did they know that the colon was actually being affected if it wasn't showing signs of inflammation? Well, they looked very closely at the colon's function, both in terms of its sensory perception, so how it senses stimuli, and its motor activity, so how it moves things along. And what they found was that even though there was no inflammation, these mice with bladder inflammation developed a phenotype that was similar to constipation. So it's a slowing down of the gut's normal movements. Exactly. They measured this by testing how long it took the mice to expel a small bee that they had put into the colon. And it took the mice with bladder issues significantly longer. Oh, wow. More importantly, they also found that these mice had an increased sensitivity to their colons being distended. Meaning their colons were more easily irritated. Exactly. And again, they measured this using VMRs, just like they did for the bladder. So basically they were seeing a heightened sensitivity in the colon, even though there was no direct inflammation there. It's like the bladder's distress was somehow being transmitted to the colon. That's a great way to put it. And this finding was really key, because it provided strong evidence that the bladder inflammation could indeed trigger these IBS-like symptoms in the gut, even in the absence of any local pathology in the colon itself. Okay, so the connection is becoming clear. Inflammation in one place leading to increased sensitivity in another. But how is this happening? How are these two organs, seemingly so distant from each other, communicating? Well, that's the million-dollar question, right? And this is where the concept of what are called polyorganic sensory neurons comes into play. So the researchers, based on their observations, they started to think, okay, maybe there's a direct neural circuit connecting the bladder and the colon. Maybe that's how they're talking to each other. So a direct line, like a phone line, between these two organs? Yeah, that's a good analogy. And how did they go about mapping these neurons? How do you even begin to see these microscopic connections? They used a really elegant technique called retrograde tracing. Retrograde tracing. Yeah, so they injected these fluorescent dyes, actually two different colors of cholera toxin B or CTB, into the bladder and the colon of the mice. Okay, two different colors, one for each organ. Exactly. So these dyes, they get taken up by the nerve endings in the organs, and then they travel backwards up the nerve fibers all the way to the cell bodies of those neurons, which are located in clusters called dorsal root ganglia or DRGs. DRGs, got it. And these ganglia are located near the spinal cord. That's right. They're kind of like relay stations for sensory information coming from the body. So essentially, if a single neuron had connections to both the bladder and the colon, it would light up with both colors. You got it. And that's exactly what they saw. Really? Yep. While most of the neurons were specific to either the bladder or the colon, they found that a significant portion, about 15.5% of the neurons they looked at, showed both colors. Wow, that's a pretty decent chunk of neurons. It is. And it really pointed to this shared neural pathway. Like these neurons are acting as these dual sensors, picking up information from both the bladder and the colon. Fascinating. And this wasn't the case with the autonomic nervous system. Right. So the bladder and the colon, they also receive input from the autonomic nervous system, which controls things like involuntary muscle contractions and heart rate. Okay. But when the researchers looked at the autonomic neurons that connected to these organs, they found very little overlap. So the autonomic nervous system wasn't really the key player in this inter-organ communication. It was those shared sensory neurons. Exactly. They seem to be the main conduit. But okay, just because these neurons are connected to both organs doesn't necessarily mean that they're actually firing in response to signals from both, right? How did the researchers test that? That's a great point. Anatomy is one thing, but function is another. Right. So they did these really cool experiments using in vivo calcium imaging. In vivo calcium imaging. Sounds complicated. It's a technique that allows them to visualize the activity of neurons in real time in living animals. So they used mice that had this special fluorescent calcium indicator gifted to their sensory neurons. And then they separately distended or stretched the bladder and the colon in these mice. And they watched to see which neurons lit up. Because when a neuron fires, it releases calcium, which then binds to this indicator and causes it to fluores
