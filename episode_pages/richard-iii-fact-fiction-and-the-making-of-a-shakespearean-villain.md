## Description

In this episode, we sift history from drama, peeling back Tudor myths to see what Richard III might have beenâ€”schemer, anti-hero, or something in between. We explore Shakespeare's portrayal, the sources, the role of propaganda, and the play's enduring lines, plus a curious link to Lincoln and the power of words.

## Transcript

You ever get the feeling that history's villains are almost like too perfect? Like they were practically born to be bad? Yeah, I guess it's easier to just label people like that, right? Right. Heroes and villains. Good and evil. Black and white. Exactly. Well today we are diving into a figure who basically embodies that villain archetype. Shakespeare's Richard III. Oh yeah. A scheming, murderous king described as literally deformed. You don't get much more villainous. He's got a reputation, that's for sure. Yeah, but is there more to the story? Well that's what we're going to try to find out today. Using Richard III's Wikipedia page as our guide. That's right. We're going to be separating fact from fiction, Shakespearean style. Right. By the end of this deep dive, you'll have a fresh perspective on Richard III. That's right. Understand what Shakespeare was really doing with this play. And maybe even pick up some trivia to impress your friends at your next party. You might even end up feeling a little sympathetic towards the so-called villain. Okay, so before we get into the really interesting stuff, let's set the scene. Okay. Richard III is the final play in Shakespeare's first tetralogy. Which means? That's a fancy way of saying it's the fourth play in a series of four. Focusing on this period of English history. We are smack dab in the middle of the Wars of the Roses, 15th century England. A bloody battle for the throne between the Yorks and the Lancasters. Okay. Talk about a dramatic backdrop. Oh yeah, shifting alliances, brutal power. Grabs enough intrigue to fill an entire library. So Shakespeare had a ton of material to work with. But he wasn't just recreating history, was he? We know he probably used sources like Holland's Chronicles. But he also took some liberties, especially when it came to Richard. Absolutely. So Shakespeare was writing during the reign of the Tudors. Who, let's just say, had their own reasons for making Richard III look bad. Yeah, definitely a vested interest. After all, their claim to the throne was directly linked to his downfall. So basically the Tudors wanted to make sure that everyone saw Richard as this tyrant who deserved to be overthrown. Convenient. Very much so. It makes their rule a lot more legitimate if the guy before you is like the ultimate villain. Okay, so knowing that Shakespeare may be playing a little fast and loose with history, let's meet the Richard he created. And I have to say, he doesn't exactly try to hide his villainy, does he? No, not at all. Right from that opening monologue, Richard tells the audience exactly what he's all about. I am determined to prove a villain, he says. Talk about setting the stage, and he really lives up to that promise. Richard is what you might call a Machiavellian mastermind. Now Machiavellian comes from Niccolo Machiavelli, a political philosopher who argued that sometimes you have to be ruthless to get what you want. Sound familiar? Richard is all about manipulation, intelligence, cold-blooded ambition. He is playing the game of thrones, and he's playing to win no matter the cost. And he's really smart about using his own perceived weaknesses to his advantage. He had scoliosis, which probably meant that he had a physical deformity, and he plays that up, trying to get sympathy and using it to kind of disarm his opponents. It's fascinating and also kind of disturbing to see how he takes what other people might consider a weakness and turns it into a weapon. He gets how to play the victim, how to make people underestimate him, and then bam, he strikes. Totally. He's a master manipulator, no question. And it's this blend of intelligence and ruthlessness that makes him such a captivating character. But as the play goes on, we see that charm kind of fade away, right? As his crimes get worse, he becomes more isolated, even alienated from his own family. He loses that playful, almost seductive energy. Yeah, there's definitely a shift. Yeah. It's like the weight of his actions. The consequences of everything he's done are starting to catch up with him. Which brings us to a really interesting question. Is he really just a villain, or is there something more? Some scholars even say that he could be considered like an anti-hero. That's a debate that has been going on for centuries. Really? Yeah. On the one hand, he's clever, witty, even entertaining at times. Right. But then again, he commits some truly horrific acts. Shakespeare was amazing at making his villains human. He was. Like giving them just enough depth and complexity to make you question your own judgments. Yeah, exactly. He doesn't give you easy answers. Right. But we have to remember, we're looking at a super fictionalized version of Richard III. Okay. Shakespeare really played around with the historical facts, so it's important to separate the myth from the man. Right. Like all those deaths that Shakespeare says Richard was responsible for. Was he really? Well, historians are still debating that today. Oh, wow. And it's unlikely that he was involved in every single one. Right. And then there's that mystery of the princes in the tower, you know? Oh, yeah. Those two young nephews who disappear. Yeah. Nobody knows what happened to them. Right. Richard's role in all that is still a huge question mark. It's one of those historical puzzles that keeps us coming back for more. Totally. And speaking of historical embellishment, even Richard's physical deformity might be exaggerated in the play. Right. We know he had scoliosis, but Shakespeare probably played up those physical differences to, you know, make him seem even more evil. Yeah, it all plays into that image of Richard as, like, twisted, you know, both physically and morally. It's really powerful imagery, but it's not necessarily true. So we're starting to see that the Richard III we meet in Shakespeare's play is more a product of Tudor propaganda and artistic license than a faithful representation of the actual historical figure. Exactly. But even as a fictional character, Richard III gives us a really powerful way to explore some timeless themes. Like this idea of fate versus free will. Yeah. Is Richard, like, destined to be evil? Or does he actually make his own choices? It's a question that comes up over and over again, right? You've got Queen Margaret, for example. Uh-huh. She's, like, constantly throwing curses at Richard. Right. Practically willing him to fail. Right. So it makes you wonder, is he fighting against something he can't control? Right, and then there's this whole idea of, like, divine punishment. Uh-huh. Shakespeare was writing in a time when people really believed in God's role in human affairs. Oh, yeah. So is Richard's downfall a result of, like, his own actions? Or is it, like, divine intervention? God saying, like, you know, this is what you get. Shakespeare definitely doesn't tell us for sure. Yeah. But it's interesting to think about how, like, that whole belief system may have affected the way the audience saw Richard. Right. Did they see him as, like, a pawn in some big cosmic game? It adds a whole other layer, doesn't it? Yeah. And then, of course, there's the whole theme of power and ambition. Of course. Richard is willing to do anything to get that crown. Uh-huh. Even if it means betraying his family. Right. Murdering his rivals. Terrorizing the whole kingdom. It's a classic story, right? Yeah. How power can corrupt even the best of us. How far would you go to get what you want? It's a good question. It really is. And, you know, it's not all doom and gloom. Yeah. Shakespeare manages to work in some humor. Oh, yeah. He was great at that, balancing the dark stuff with some light moments. Yeah. Like that scene where Buckingham tries to get the people of London to support Richard. Oh, yeah. He's, like, practically begging them to cheer. But they just stand there totally silent. It's so good. Yeah. Such a good example of Shakespeare's irony. Yeah. You've got Richard, you know. The supposed son of York. Exactly. He promised to end the winter of our discontent. Right. But he can't even get one person to clap for him. Oh, the audience would have been cracking up. For sure. And speaking of famous lines. Yeah. We can't forget some of Richard's most iconic quotes. Oh, yeah. They've become, like, part of our everyday language. Totally. Like, now is the winter of our discontent. Yeah. It's perfect. It captures, like, the mood of the whole play. Yeah. You know, that sense of unrest, that desire for something better. Right. And then there's my kingdom for a horse. Oh, yeah. Which has basically come to mean just, like, desperate longing. It's amazing how those lines have become so much bigger than the play itself. Yeah. They really have a life of their own. Okay. Now, before we move on, I have to bring up something that I always find fascinating about Richard III. Okay. The connection to Lincoln's assassination. Oh, yeah. Talk about a historical coincidence that gives you chills. I know. Yeah. Lincoln was a huge Shakespeare fan. Richard III was, like, one of his favorite plays. Yeah. And the man who assassinated him, John Wilkes Booth, was a Shakespearean actor who was actually known for playing both Richard and, get this, Richmond, the man who defeats Richard in the play. It's almost too strange to be true. I know. It really makes you think about the power of words. You know, how they can still have such a powerful effect even centuries later.
