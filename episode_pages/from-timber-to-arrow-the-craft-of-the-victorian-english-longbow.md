## Transcript

Have you ever felt that primal urge to craft something truly unique, something steeped in history and skill, and then actually use it? Like say, making your very own longbow and arrows, and then feeling that power as you send an arrow flying? Well, if that thought has ever sparked even a flicker of curiosity, you are definitely in for a treat today. We're taking a deep dive into the really fascinating world of traditional longbow and arrow making. And we'll be guided by insights from folks who haven't just mastered this ancient craft, but are really passionately dedicated to passing it on. Exactly. Yeah, our journey today, it goes right from the raw timber to a finely tuned piece of archery equipment. We're drawing on decades of experience, actually, from a family-run business and tracing the remarkable comeback of traditional bowyery. And understanding why every single step, you know, from selecting the wood to fitting the tiniest detail, is this profound blend of art, science, and, well, a whole lot of patience. Okay, right. Let's unpack this then. Our mission today, to uncover the secrets of crafting a traditional English longbow and its arrows. To understand the dedication it really takes. And maybe, just maybe, inspire you listening to pick up a raft yourself. What's fascinating here, I think, is that we're talking about a craft that almost vanished entirely. You know, when we think about traditional longbows, it's kind of easy to assume these skills have always been around. But the truth is, the intricate knowledge needed to make them almost completely disappeared. Modern equipment, with its efficiency and, you know, mass production, it really pushed these ancient crafts right to the brink. Making the demand for handmade bows and the artisans who made them incredibly scarce. That's right. And the turning point, maybe surprisingly, was fairly recent. We're talking the mid-1980s. What we saw then was this rapid rise in membership in the British Longbow Society, the BLBS. People weren't just interested in using longbows. A lot of them wanted to make them, too. And this resurgence really highlighted a pretty significant gap. There just weren't enough reliable sources for high-quality traditional kit. This is where Mr. Hugh Soar, who was secretary of the BLBS at the time, he recognized a critical need. Ah, okay. And he acted on it. He did. In 1987, Mr. Soar founded the Craft Guild. His vision was to bring together skilled craftsmen, people who could produce longbows and arrows that met really exceptional standards of quality and performance. Right, so it wasn't just about making stuff. It was about building a community. Exactly. Fostering a thriving community dedicated to preserving and elevating these standards, ensuring the craft's authentic legacy continued. And that commitment to passing on knowledge, that brings us nicely to the personal story of a modern bowyer, doesn't it? It does. How does a passion for something so niche, so historical, how does it actually take root and survive across generations now? Often it starts with a childhood spark. Take Richard Head, for instance. His journey began with that classic boyhood dream, you know, emulating Robin Hood. But he got frustrated by the lack of quality off-the-shelf longbows back then. So what did he do? He decided to make his own. Wow. And that fascination just grew into a lifelong devotion. And that's where it gets really captivating, that hobby turned into a full-time business. And then, in this amazing continuation of tradition, his son, Philip, became his apprentice. I mean, think about that. The first time a bowyer had apprenticed to his own father in literally hundreds of years. Quite something. Together, they've got over 35 years of combined experience now, and they're really dedicated to sharing that knowledge, making sure these vital skills aren't lost again. Yeah. And it's probably important to clarify the specific type of longbow we're focusing on today. We're talking about the Victorian English longbow. Now, this isn't the heavy medieval warbow you might picture from, say, Agincourt. Right. Different beast altogether. Completely. It's a recreational and sporting bow, often celebrated for its elegance, sometimes really exquisite beauty. Remarkably, it was even used in the Olympics for a time. No kidding. Yeah. And what's particularly noteworthy is how inclusive it was in the Victorian era. It was actually one of the few sports where women could compete directly alongside men. Huh. That's actually quite progressive for the time. It really was. Made it a very popular pastime. So, okay, if you're sitting there dreaming of crafting one of these beautiful things, where on earth do you begin? It has to start with the wood, right? It does. It all starts with the wood. And what's fascinating, as you hinted, is that getting bow wood isn't like popping down the local DIY store. You don't just buy it. You often have to kind of find it, understand its character. Exactly. You need to coax it into becoming a bow. Right. And you, of course, that's the iconic wood. It's the one everyone thinks of. But be warned, it's incredibly expensive, especially for top-quality stuff. And it's notoriously difficult to work with. Was it? Well, its grain patterns are unique, often irregular. Plus, it demands years, literally years, of careful seasoning before it's even ready to be worked. And just a gentle reminder, please respect ancient trees, especially in churchyards or protected areas. Their value is immense, far beyond just bow wood. Absolutely. Vital point. Okay, so for those of us just starting out, maybe not ready for the U challenge, what are the practical alternatives? Ash is an excellent choice. Great for a self-bow, that's a bow made from a single piece of wood. It's affordable, much more widely available, and you can often get it already seasoned. Okay, ash. Anything else? Lemonwood is another versatile staple. And if you really want to ease into it, ready-made kits are a fantastic way to, you know, get your hands dirty without sourcing the raw materials yourself. Kits sound like a good entry point. They can be, yeah. Now, when it comes to actually building the bow, you've basically got two main types of construction. There's the self-bow, like we said, one piece of wood. And then there's the laminated bow, which is constructed from multiple thin pieces or laminates glued together. Okay, laminated, is there an advantage to that? There is, particularly in performance. Laminating often involves curing the stave on something called a former. This forces the wood to bend opposite to how it will be strung. It creates what's called setback. Setback, bending it the wrong way first. Sort of, yeah. It sounds counterintuitive, but this pre-stresses the wood. It dramatically increases the bow's power, what we call cast. So you get a faster shot. And critically, it helps prevent string fallows. String fallows. That's where the bow limbs start to take a permanent curve in the direction of the string over time, losing power as the bow ages. Setback helps fight that. Got it. Okay, so you've got your wood. Maybe it's a stave, maybe it's laminates. What's next? Roughing out. That's one, roughing out. Imagine you've got a squared piece of timber. You need to transform it into a sort of D-shaped cross-section, flat on the back, rounded on the belly side. Right. You're gradually removing wood, shaping that belly side until it starts to curve evenly along its length. Tools. What are we using here? Basic hand tools, mostly. A spokeshave is key. A good rasp. Maybe a cabinet scraper for finer work. And the golden rule. Patience. Take your time. Seriously, rushing here is the quickest way to ruin a good piece of wood. Patience isn't just a virtue in bow making. It's essential. I bet. And this stage, roughing out, it presents particular challenges if you're brave enough to start with self-you. Ah, back to the tricky you. Yeah. You staves often have natural knots and lumps from where side branches grew. You can't just power through them or cut them out. You have to handle them with extreme care. Sometimes you need to leave a bit of extra wood around them to maintain the integrity, prevent future cracks. It's a delicate dance respecting the wood's character. Okay, this next part sounds like where the real alchemy happens. Tillering. You said it's the soul of bow making. It truly is. This isn't just a mechanical step. It's where the wood comes alive, where your intuition as a bowyer really takes center stage. Tillering is the art of changing a piece of wood into a functional bow. How does it work? It's a slow, iterative process. You're constantly observing how the limbs bend and develop an even, balanced curve as you apply pressure. Think of it like a conversation with the wood. You bend it slightly, see how it responds, and then you carefully remove tiny amounts of material, maybe with a scraper, from the stiffer areas until the stress is distributed perfectly along both limbs. Sounds subtle. It is incredibly subtle. And it's very hard to teach by formula because every single piece of wood is unique. Its density, its grain, everything. It genuinely takes years, maybe decades, to perfect your eye for tillering, that intuition. It's about coaxing the wood to reveal its stored power, not forcing it. Okay, so how do you actually do that? You need some kind of rig, right? A tillering stick. Exactly. You need a tillering stick or a tillering tree. It's the device you mount the bow on, usually horizontally. It allows you to draw the string to specific points and then stand back and observe the bow's curve under tension. Can you make one yourself? Absolutely. A simple DIY
