## Description

A clear, accessible dive into Wrightâ€™s Law and the experience curve: how cumulative production lowers unit costs, and the math behind the progress ratio and learning rate. We trace the idea from Ebbinghausâ€™s memory experiments to Curtis Wrightâ€™s aircraft data, then explore how learning happens at the individual, team, and organizational levels. Along the way we connect the concept to manufacturing, software, and automation, and discuss what this means for progress, efficiency, and innovation.

Welcome back to the Deep Dive listeners. Today we're diving into a fascinating topic, one that I think you'll find has some really interesting implications for understanding, well, progress and efficiency, I guess you could say, in a whole bunch of different areas. We're talking about Wright's Law. Wright's Law, okay. And to guide us through this, we have joining us a true expert on this subject. Welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. I'm excited to dive into this. It can be a little bit technical, but it's also really intuitive when you start thinking about it. And we'll be using for this deep dive, primarily the Wikipedia entries on experience curve effects and learning curve. Those give us a really good foundation for understanding this whole concept. Okay, great. So for our listeners who might not be familiar, what exactly is Wright's Law? I mean, when I first heard the term, I have to admit, it sounded a bit intimidating, like something out of an economics textbook. Yeah, it definitely has that kind of, you know, a technical ring to it. But at its core, it's actually a pretty straightforward idea. It's all about the relationship between how much of something we produce and how much it costs to produce each unit. Okay, so the more we make, the cheaper it gets. Is that basically it? You got it. That's the essence of it. And it's not just some random observation. It's been observed and studied across a huge range of industries and products, from airplanes to microchips, from cars to, well, you name it. So there's actually some data to back this up. It's not just a gut feeling. Oh, absolutely. And it goes back a surprisingly long way. Before we even get to Wright's Law itself, it's worth touching on some earlier work that laid the groundwork for this whole idea. Back in the late 1800s, a German psychologist named Hermann Ebbinghaus was studying memory, and he found something pretty remarkable. Oh, this is fascinating. Tell me more. So Ebbinghaus was doing these experiments where he tried to memorize lists of nonsense syllables, just random combinations of letters. And what he discovered was that the more he practiced, the easier it became to memorize those lists. Not only did it take him less time, but he also made fewer mistakes. So he was literally learning as he went along, and that learning showed up as a measurable improvement in his performance. Precisely. And this wasn't just about rote memorization. It was about his brain becoming more efficient at processing and retaining information through repeated exposure and practice. His work really highlighted that fundamental link between experience and improved performance, even in cognitive tasks like memory. So that's the seed of the idea. But how did we get from memorizing nonsense syllables to, like you said, airplanes and microchips? How did this idea of learning through experience make its way into the world of manufacturing and industry? Well, that's where Theodore Paul Wright comes in. He was an engineer working at Curtis Wright, an aircraft manufacturer, back in the 1930s. And he observed something pretty striking in their production data. He noticed that every time the total number of aircraft they had ever produced doubled, the amount of labor required to build a new aircraft fell by about 20%. Wow, 20%. That's a pretty significant drop. So just by virtue of having built more planes, they were getting much faster and more efficient at building them. And that's where the term Wright's Law comes from. Exactly. That specific 20% decrease observed in the aircraft industry became known as Wright's Law. It was really one of the earliest quantifications of this learning curve effect, which describes how costs tend to decline as cumulative production increases. So this learning curve is basically the same idea, just applied more broadly to different industries and products. I mean, is Wright's Law essentially an early example of a learning curve in action? Yeah, that's a good way to think about it. The learning curve is a more general model that captures this phenomenon of cost reduction with increased production. And while that initial 20% figure was specific to aircraft manufacturing at that time, studies across a wide range of industries have shown similar patterns. I mean, you see it in car manufacturing, shipbuilding, electronics, software development, you name it. The exact percentage might vary. Some industries might see just a few percent reduction per doubling, while others might see closer to 30%. But the trend is remarkably consistent. So it seems like this learning curve is kind of a universal principle, at least in a lot of manufacturing contexts. But what exactly is it about producing more that leads to these efficiency gains? I mean, what are the underlying mechanisms driving this effect? Right, it's not just magic. There are some very real factors at play. And the primary driver, as we hinted at with Ebbinghaus, is learning, but not just in the individual sense. It's learning that happens at multiple levels, at the individual worker level, at the team level, and even at the organizational level. Okay, so break that down for us. How does learning actually translate into lower costs and greater efficiency? Well, at the individual level, as workers repeatedly perform the same tasks, they naturally become more skilled and efficient. Think about it. The first time you try to assemble something, it probably takes you a while, and you might make a few mistakes along the way. But as you do it over and over again, you develop muscle memory, you figure out the best way to position things, you anticipate the next step, and you just naturally become faster and more accurate. That makes perfect sense. It's like any skill, really. The more you practice, the better you get. But how does that individual learning scale up to the level of an entire factory or a whole company? That's where things like standardization, specialization, and methods improvements come in. As companies gain more experience producing something, they often realize that certain parts or processes can be standardized, which reduces variability and makes things more efficient. They can also specialize their workforce, allowing individuals to focus on specific tasks that they become highly skilled at, rather than trying to be a jack-of-all-trades. So it's about optimizing the entire production system, breaking things down into smaller, more manageable chunks, and finding the most efficient way to do each one. Exactly. And it's not a one-time thing. Companies are constantly looking for ways to improve their methods, whether it's through process reengineering, implementing new technologies, or simply finding better ways to organize their work. And as they implement these improvements, they learn from what works and what doesn't, and that learning feeds back into further improvements. It sounds like a continuous cycle of improvement driven by this accumulating experience. And you mentioned technology. What role does technological innovation play in all of this? Oh, it's huge. I mean, think about the impact of automation, robotics, and advanced manufacturing techniques. These technologies can dramatically increase productivity and efficiency, often allowing us to do things that were previously impossible or prohibitively expensive. But technology itself is also subject to this learning curve effect. How so? I mean, isn't technology supposed to be about, like, breakthroughs and sudden leaps forward? It is. But even with breakthroughs, there's still a process of learning how to best implement and utilize those new technologies. Think about, say, the development of 3D printing. The initial hype was all about how it would revolutionize manufacturing, and in many ways it has. But it also took time for companies to figure out the best materials to use, the optimal printing parameters, how to design for 3D printing, and so on. So even with a radical new technology, there's still this learning curve as we figure out how to use it effectively and integrate it into existing production processes. It's not an instant game changer. Right, it's an evolution. And that evolution often involves a lot of trial and error, experimentation, and knowledge sharing within the industry. And as we gain more experience with a particular technology, we often find ways to improve its performance, reduce its costs, expand its applications. Okay, so we've got this idea of learning happening at multiple levels. Individual workers getting better at their tasks, companies optimizing their processes and adopting new technologies, and all of this contributes to this downward trend in costs as we produce more. But is there, like, a mathematical way to express this relationship, to quantify this learning curve effect? There is. And it's actually pretty elegant, though it might seem a bit intimidating at first glance. It all starts with what we call the progress ratio, which is usually represented by the letter B. Think of it as the percentage of the cost that remains after you double production. So B is 0.8. That means every time you double the total quantity you've ever produced, the cost to make the next unit is only 80% of what it was before the doubling. Okay, I'm following so far. So a lower B means a steeper learning curve, faster cost reductions. Exactly. And the flip side of that is the learning rate, which is just 1 minus the progress ratio. It tells you the proportion by which the unit cost decreases with each doubling of cumulative production. So if your progress ratio is 0.8, meaning your costs are 80% of what they were before, then your learning rate is 20%, meaning you're seeing a 20% cost reduction with each doubling. Okay, that makes sense. But how do we actually use this to calculate costs? I mean, is there a formula for this? There is. And it's a power function. It looks like this. cx equals c1 times x raised to the power of log base 2 of b. I'm going to be honest, that looks a little bit scary. Could you break that down for us non-mathematicians out there? Sure, no problem. So cx is the unit cost of producing the xth unit. c1 is the cost of the very
