## Transcript

Welcome back everyone to our deep dive into computer science. In this series, we've been sort of exploring all this really cool stuff happening at the cutting edge of software engineering. And today, well, we're going to take on something that almost feels like science fiction. We're talking quantum computing. Absolutely. And specifically, Microsoft just unveiled their Majorana 1 chip. Yes, they have. And, well, it's causing a lot of buzz in the tech world. A lot of excitement around this. Yeah, so I think to understand why everyone is so excited about this, let's take a step back for a minute. And for anyone who might not be familiar, just quickly explain what quantum computing is and why it's such a big deal. Yeah, absolutely. So you can think of it this way. Our current computers are kind of like really methodical swakers. You know, they're tackling problems one step at a time. They have to go through each step. Exactly. Quantum computers, they're more like helicopters. They can kind of explore a bunch of different possibilities all at once. So they're not limited by having to go through all the steps? Not in the same way. I see. They use these sort of strange rules of quantum mechanics to do calculations in ways that classical computers just can't. Oh, okay. So it's a totally different approach to computation. Absolutely, a totally different paradigm. So where does this Majorana 1 chip fit into all of this? Well, the Majorana 1 is special because it uses a new type of qubit. Okay. Now a qubit is like the basic building block of information in a quantum computer. The sort of quantum equivalent of a bit? That's a good way to think about it. Okay. And these new qubits that Microsoft is using are called topological qubits. Topological qubits. And this is where it gets really interesting. Okay. Because these qubits are built using particles that don't even exist in nature. Whoa, hold on. I got to stop you right there. Yeah. How is that even possible? Particles that don't exist in nature. It is pretty mind-blowing, isn't it? So these particles, they're called Majorana particles. Okay. And they are essentially coaxed into existence using a very specific mix of materials and conditions. So you're creating these particles artificially? In a way, yes. Oh, wow. Microsoft has actually built this new materials stack. Okay. And they've done it atom by atom using indium arsenide and aluminum. Hold on, atom by atom? That's got to be incredibly complex. It is a feat of engineering for sure. So what's the advantage of going to all that trouble? Why not just use particles that already exist? Well, it comes down to stability. Imagine trying to build a skyscraper on a foundation of sand. Yeah, that doesn't sound very stable. Not a good idea, right? No. Traditional qubits, they're notoriously fragile. Okay. And they're prone to errors. So they're kind of like that shaky foundation. So these topological qubits, they're more stable because they're built on these Majorana particles. Exactly. And that stability is absolutely crucial if you want to build larger, more powerful quantum computers. And that's why Microsoft is aiming for a million qubit quantum computer. That's right. They're thinking big. A million qubits, that's almost unimaginable. It's a huge leap forward. So why is that number so important, a million qubits? Well, a million qubits is kind of considered a magic number in the quantum world. Okay. Because it opens up the door to solving these really complex problems like the ones we talked about earlier. Like self-healing materials? Exactly. I see. And what's exciting is that Microsoft believes that their architecture, it actually gives them a clear path to fitting that many qubits onto a single chip. So you're saying that they could actually build a million qubit quantum computer? That's the goal. And they seem to have a pretty solid plan for getting there. Wow, that's incredible that that kind of density is just unimaginable with the current approaches to quantum computing. It's a game changer for sure. But let's take a step back for a second. Okay. We've been talking about these Majorana particles like they're something magical. Yeah. How do they actually work? What makes them so special? Well, Majorana particles have this really bizarre characteristic that are their own antiparticles. Wait, what? Yeah, it's a bit of a head scratcher. How can something be its own opposite? It's one of those strange things that comes out of quantum mechanics. Okay. But basically it means that a Majorana particle can be both a particle and its own antiparticle at the same time. My brain is definitely bending a little bit here. It's a lot to wrap your head around. But how does that relate to building more stable qubits? So think about it like braiding strands of hair. Okay. The way those strands are braided, that stores information, right? Right. And if one strand gets snagged, the whole braid doesn't unravel. It still holds together. Exactly. The information is kind of spread out. Okay. And that's kind of what's happening with these topological qubits. I see. The information isn't localized to a single point, which makes them much more resilient to errors. So by harnessing this unusual property of Majorana particles, Microsoft is essentially building a more robust foundation for their quantum computer. That's a great way to put it. It's like they're etching information into stone rather than writing it on a piece of paper. Wow, it's a much more durable approach. And that resilience is really a huge step towards making large-scale quantum computers a reality. This is all incredibly fascinating, but I'm curious, were people skeptical of this approach initially? Oh, there were definite doubts. I mean, Microsoft was essentially betting on a particle that doesn't even exist naturally. It was a bold move to put so much investment into something that was largely unproven at the time. So it was a big gamble. You could say that, but it seems to be paying off. They've essentially created a new type of transistor for the quantum age. That's a great analogy. One that's built on these exotic particles and their unique properties. And it's not just about the qubits themselves. It's also about Microsoft's unique approach to scalability. So they're really thinking long-term. Absolutely. They're not just trying to build a slightly better quantum computer. They're trying to create a whole new paradigm. They're aiming to completely change the game. It's amazing to think that we might be on the verge of a quantum revolution. It's an exciting time to be alive, that's for sure. Driven by a particle that we can't even see or touch in our everyday lives. It's a testament to the power of human ingenuity. It really is. And our relentless pursuit of understanding the universe at its most fundamental level. Well said. And it's a reminder that the future of technology is often stranger than fiction. I completely agree with you there. Well, on that note, let's maybe take a quick break. Sounds good. We'll come back and we'll talk a little bit more about some of the challenges ahead. All right. And the potential real-world applications of this mind-blowing technology. I'm looking forward to it. Me too. So it really is mind-boggling to think about what a million-qubit quantum computer could do. It's a lot of power. It really is. But you mentioned that there are still some challenges ahead. Oh, of course. What are some of the hurdles that stand between us and this quantum-powered future? Well, one of the biggest challenges, even with these more stable topological qubits, is maintaining that stability as we scale up. So even though they're more resilient than traditional qubits, they're not completely immune to errors. Exactly. It's kind of like building a giant house of cards. You know, the bigger it gets, the more likely it is to collapse. So noise and other disruptions can still cause problems. They can, especially as we try to pack more and more qubits onto a single chip. And that's why error correction is so important. Absolutely essential. So what does that involve in the quantum world, error correction? Well, it's basically developing sophisticated ways to detect and correct errors in the qubit states. So it's like having a team of tiny quantum mechanics constantly monitoring and repairing those qubits. That's a good way to think about it. Making sure that they stay in working order. Exactly. They're keeping everything running smoothly. So you're building safeguards into the system to compensate for that inherent fragility. Right. Because at the end of the day, quantum states are very delicate. They are. And so finding efficient and scalable error correction methods, that's a huge area of research right now. So it sounds like a constant push and pull, right? It is. You're trying to push the limits of what's possible, but at the same time, you have to make sure that the system remains stable and reliable. You have to find that balance. And then on top of all of that, there's also the challenge of developing the software and the algorithms that are actually needed to harness the power of these quantum computers. That's a whole other challenge altogether. So it's not enough to just build the hardware. No, it's not. You need the tools and the instructions to tell it what to do. You got to speak its language. And that's where the field of quantum software engineering comes in. Exactly. It's a brand new field, and it's just bursting with possibilities. I can imagine it requires a whole new way of thinking about programming. Oh, absolutely. It's like learning to communicate with an entirely new species. So we need a new generation of computer scientists and engineers. We do. Who are fluent in the language of quantum computing. People who can think in quantum terms. It's exciting to think that we're witnessing the birth of a whole new discipline. It's an incredible time to be involved in this field. One that could redefine the boundaries of what's possible
