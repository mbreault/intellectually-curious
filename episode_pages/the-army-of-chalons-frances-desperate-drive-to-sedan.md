## Transcript

Welcome to another deep dive. Today we're going way back in time to 1870s France. We'll be looking at the Army of Chalons. Yeah, it's a really fascinating story of this army that was, they had to like build it from scratch and they were really hoping it would save the entire country. It was during the Franco-Prussian War and didn't last long. But it's still a very important part of military history. Right. We're going to learn about some epic battles, political intrigue. We've got some great excerpts from Wikipedia to work from and even a timeline to keep everything straight. Should be fun. Okay, so first let's set the scene. It's August 1870 and France is, they're not doing so great. Not so great. The Franco-Prussian War is just raging on and on and their main army, the Army of the Rhine, is getting, well, it's getting trounced. Yeah, and it's kind of fascinating to see how quickly things really fell apart for the French, I mean. You know, they suffered these terrible defeats at Wissembourg, WÃ¶rth and Forbach. All in like just a few days. Just days, yeah. And that just puts so much pressure on the French leadership. Total, it was like total panic mode. Yeah. Empress Eugenie. Empress Eugenie. She steps up as regent. Yeah. While Emperor Napoleon III, he's like scrambling. Scrambling. Trying to reorganize the military. He ends up appointing Marshal Bazin. Bazin. To lead that Army of the Rhine. Right. Well, that was the plan at least, but that's not exactly how it all played out. Not quite. Bazin and all of his forces, they ended up getting trapped by the Prussians in Metz. Okay, so that is where the Army of Chalons comes in. Yeah. It was really a very desperate move trying to turn the tide to break that siege. So, where did all these, where did they get all these guys? It was kind of, you know, the sources say they just took leftover troops, reserves. Oh, wow. Even units they'd just put together. They all get sent to this camp at Chalons and put under Marshal McMahon. McMahon. Yeah. Okay. This all happened, it was like August 17th. August 17th. That's when the army was formed. So, you can imagine like chaos, right? Yeah. It was urgent. They needed an army. Fast. Makes sense. Well, we're talking about more than 120,000 men. 120,000 men. And who knows what kind of experience they all had and equipment, you know? A real mix. Yeah, that sounds like a logistical nightmare. Oh, yeah. And of course, you have Marshal McMahon who is leading the charge. But it looks like some other important people were there too. Oh, yeah. Definitely. We have Generals Ducreux, Feli, Lebrun, and Wimffen. They all played a part in all of this. They did. They did. And it's, okay, so this is where things get even more interesting. Because McMahon, he decides to try and relieve Bazin's trapped army. Oh, wow. I mean, talk about a risky move. Especially given the state of this army, you know? They were not ready. They actually set off from Rheims on August 23rd and started marching towards Sedan and Verdun. Trying to outmaneuver. Yeah, trying to outmaneuver the Prussians. The Prussians. So the timeline here gets really crazy. Yeah, it does. You have the French marching northeast and then the Prussian forces, people like General Von Der Than, right on their heels. Yeah, I mean, you have to keep in mind the Prussians, they had momentum. And they had a lot more soldiers. The sources say that they actually reorganized into the 3rd and Meuse armies. Combined force. A combined force of like almost 225,000 men. And they had more artillery. Yeah, so they were a force to be reckoned with. Oh, for sure. Okay, so then you have the clashes at Noir and Beaumont. Those were turning points, right? Huge turning points. The French 5th Corps under General Feli, they get absolutely destroyed at Beaumont. August 30th. August 30th. And that just totally shattered any hope they had of rescuing Bazin. Oh, yeah. Beaumont was, well, it was the end of the, I mean, can you imagine what that did to the morale of the entire army? It's hard to even imagine. I know. And McMahon, he has to concentrate his forces around Sedan. And then the very next day, they end up in these like crazy engagements at Bizet and Sedan itself. Wow. Talk about chaos and bravery. Oh, yeah. McMahon even gets wounded fighting. He was leading from the front, literally. Oh, yeah. But by this point, well, they're trapped. Trapped? The Prussians completely surrounded them. Surrounded. They put up a valiant last stand, you know. But it was hopeless. So it all ends on September 2nd, 1870. Yeah. The Army of Chalons surrenders at Sedan. What a loss. It was a crushing defeat for France. Absolutely crushing. The sources say 124,000 men were lost, captured, or just out of action. Yeah. And it pretty much sealed the fate of the Second French Empire. So we've gone from this army that was just like thrown together. Together, yeah. To this absolutely decisive battle that changed the course of history. It's amazing. You know, I think it's really interesting when you look at the Army of Chalons because it shows you how much politics can affect military decisions. Remember, Empress Eugenie. Empress Eugenie. Yeah, she was in charge, you know, acting as a regent at the time. And all those defeats at the beginning of the war, it created this, well, a climate of desperation, you could say. They needed a win. Yeah, they needed a win and they needed it fast. Something to boost morale. And that's where the idea of, you know, rescuing Bazin and Metz came from. It was a bold move. Very bold. But we were saying earlier, I mean, the army, the army wasn't ready for something like that. Oh, no, they were not ready. And it sounds like there were a lot of disagreements right from the start. I was reading that Marshal McMahon, the army's commander. Right. Well, he actually wanted to retreat to Paris. To regroup. Yeah, regroup, reinforce. Which makes sense. Yeah, I mean, McMahon, he was known for being cautious. And I think he had serious doubts about whether this whole plan would work. But the politicians, they had other ideas. Yeah, Empress Eugenie, she was insistent. She was, she was very insistent. They needed to do something, you know, take some kind of decisive action. She thought, well, she believed that even a risky victory would keep the public on their side. And maybe, just maybe, turn the tide of the war. It's interesting how often political goals end up getting in the way of what might make sense from a military perspective. Yeah. It happens a lot, you know. And with the Army of Chalon, it wasn't just that they were thrown together quickly and didn't have enough training. They also had problems on the inside. Like, what do you mean? Well, like different strategies, different ideas about what they should be doing. Some of the generals, they didn't agree with McMahon's decision to march toward Sedan. They wanted to play it safer. I see, yeah. So they didn't have a united front. No. And when you're fighting an enemy like the Prussians, you really can't afford to be divided. No, that makes sense. And then there's Beaumont. You were saying that was a decisive moment. Oh, absolutely. General de Faye, he was the commander of the French 5th Corps. He made some, well, some pretty bad mistakes that led to them being completely defeated. Okay. His positioning wasn't good, and he made some tactical errors. The Prussians, they saw that and took advantage of the weaknesses in the French lines. So Beaumont was really the end of any hope of getting to Bazin. It was a major setback for sure. It hurt them strategically, and it really hit their morale. They had to fall back to Sedan, and that's where they were surrounded and had to surrender. Yeah, you know, it's amazing how one battle can change the whole course of a war. It's almost tragic when you think about it. It really is. It shows how important leadership is. Yeah. And communication. And being able to adapt when things don't go as planned. And we can't forget, the defeat at Sedan, it wasn't just a military defeat. Right, it had huge political consequences, too. Huge. I mean, Emperor Napoleon III, he was captured at Sedan. That was a major blow, symbolically speaking. It pretty much marked the end of his reign. And the Franco-Prussian War itself, I mean, it really changed the whole landscape of Europe, geopolitically. Absolutely. Germany was unified under Prussian leadership. And that created a whole new power dynamic on the continent. Germany, with its military and its industries, became a real force to be reckoned with. And that changed things for a long, long time. So in a way, everything that happened with the Army of Chalons... That was your lived army. Yeah, it all played a part in shaping the future of Europe. It did. It's a good reminder that these things
