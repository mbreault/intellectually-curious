## Description

Join us for a deep dive into berkelium (Bk, atomic number 97): a synthetic, radioactive metal discovered at UC Berkeley in 1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg and his team. We explore how berkelium is made in tiny amounts, its key isotopes (Bk-247 and Bk-249) and what they reveal about decay and transmutation, its role in creating heavier elements like tennessine, and why this elusive element remains primarily a research tool with notable safety and production challenges.

## Transcript

Welcome to another deep dive, and today we're going on a journey into the world of berkelium. Berkelium. You got it. What's so special about that? Well, get ready, because it's got quite the story and some interesting properties to boot. We're going to be pulling from excerpts on Wikipedia. Okay. And trying to figure out just what makes this element so fascinating. So to get started, maybe you could give us a quick overview of what exactly berkelium is, you know, for those of us who haven't memorized the periodic table. We won't find berkelium just, you know, lying around. Right. Berkelium is a synthetic element. Oh, okay. Which means that we have to create it. Okay, so we're already starting off with a little bit of, you know, difficulty here. This is not something that's naturally occurring. Right. Yeah. So just for clarification, this is a synthetic radioactive element, atomic number 97, symbol BK. All right, so before we get into the nitty gritty of the science, I'm really curious about how it was discovered. Because it sounds like it's, you know, a bit of a process to make it. So I can only imagine the effort to discover it. So picture this. It's 1949. Okay. Just a few years after the world witnessed the power of the atomic bomb. So this is a time when nuclear science is buzzing with all sorts of new discoveries. Yeah. And we're at UC Berkeley. A team led by Glenn T. Seaborg is about to make history. They managed to synthesize and identify berkelium for the very first time. Oh, wow. Okay, so UC Berkeley, that's where the name comes from. Yes. Okay, I was going to say, that sounds awfully familiar. Exactly. So it's named after its place of discovery. Kind of like terbium was named after Ytterby, Sweden. You got it. Where they found those rare earth minerals. Exactly. So naming elements after the place where they were discovered, it's kind of a scientific tradition. It's a way to honor the institutions and locations that play a key role in advancing our understanding of the elements. I like it. It adds a little bit of a humanity to the periodic table. Absolutely. But okay, back to berkelium. I have a feeling it's not a simple process to create it. No, no. I mean, you're talking about, you said 1949. So that's, you know, we're just getting started with nuclear technology. And I can't imagine that the equipment and everything was, you know, quite as sophisticated as is today. Oh, no, not at all. So think nuclear reactors, incredibly high neutron fluxes, and using elements like uranium and plutonium as your starting materials. Wow. It's complex, the multi-step kind of dance between neutron captures and beta decays. And you're transforming these initial elements into something new. So you're basically, it is alchemy. It kind of is. You're turning one element into another. Yeah. But the catch here is only tiny, tiny amounts have ever been produced. Wow. Which makes berkelium incredibly valuable for research. Okay, so we've got this incredibly rare element that we've managed to create. What does it even look like? Imagine a silvery white metal, but with a radioactive twist. Yeah. That's berkelium. So just like, you know, your average metal, but don't get too close. Pretty much. Okay, and I'm guessing there's more to it than meets the eye. Oh, yeah. There's always more. I've heard something about multiple oxidation states. What's the deal with that? So berkelium, it can exist in multiple oxidation states. The most stable one is plus three. Okay. Especially when it's dissolved in a solution. But here's what's fascinating. Okay. Scientists can actually use the plus four state to separate it from other elements during the production process. Oh. So it's kind of like a secret handshake. Okay. It allows them to isolate berkelium from the crowd. Okay, so that's how they get it by itself. Exactly. Okay, so different forms of the element. So we got to talk about isotopes. I know berkelium has a bunch of them. It does. Are there any that really stand out? As you know, the most important ones are the most interesting ones. Well, there are a couple that are particularly interesting. Berkelium-247 takes the prize for being the longest-lived isotope. Okay. And then you've got berkelium-249, which may not live as long, but it is the easiest to synthesize. Okay. So it's kind of the go-to isotope for a lot of berkelium research. Okay, now hold on a second. Berkelium-249, doesn't that decay into californium-249? Exactly. That's kind of cool. That's right. It decays into its neighbor on the periodic table. And that's not just a fun fact. That decay process is really valuable for scientists who are studying californium. Oh, okay. Because it allows them to see how the element transforms over time. It's like having a front-row seat. Exactly. To the radioactive show. To the radioactive show. So it's constantly changing. Now, it gets even cooler, doesn't it? Because berkelium-249 is also used to create even heavier elements. That's right. Oh, wow. It's like a stepping stone on the path to expanding the periodic table. Remember element 117, tennessine? Berkelium-249 played a crucial role in creating that. Wow. Which was a huge scientific triumph. So even though we only have tiny amounts of this element, it's a powerhouse. It is, as far as scientific discovery goes. Absolutely. But, you know, all of this has been in the lab. So what about outside of the lab? What kind of practical applications are there for berkelium? Well, that's the million-dollar question, isn't it? Right. At this point, it really is primarily used in research. Okay. But who knows what the future holds? Right. I mean, scientific exploration is all about pushing boundaries. Yeah. And uncovering that hidden potential. Yeah. So we'll see what happens. That's the beauty of science right now. You never really know where discovery might lead. Yeah. Now, you might be thinking, if it's made in nuclear reactors, could we use it as fuel? Yeah, it makes sense. You would think that maybe we could. Right. Something tells me it's not that simple. You're right. The thing is, its nuclear properties aren't ideal for a fuel source. You know, take berkelium-249, for example. It's much better at absorbing neutrons than splitting apart and releasing energy. So instead of creating energy, it's just soaking it up. Yeah, pretty much. Most of it would end up transforming into berkelium-250, which then quickly decays into californium-250. Oh, oh. It's not exactly efficient for power generation. No, not really what we're looking for there. So I guess that makes sense. But what about berkelium-247? Right. That's the one that you said was the most stable. It's the most stable isotope, yeah. So could that potentially be used? So it could theoretically sustain a chain reaction in both thermal and fast neutron reactors. Okay. But the problem is producing it is incredibly challenging. Yeah. And we just don't have enough of it readily available. Okay. So for now, it's mainly a research star. But I do have to ask, because we are talking about a radioactive element, what about safety? Do scientists need, like, hazmat suits to work with this stuff? That's a great question. And when it comes to berkelium-249, the electrons that it emits have fairly low energy. Okay. Which means it's actually relatively safe to handle. Okay. Compared to some of its other actinide cousins. Okay. So no full body protection needed. Well, precautions are always necessary. Right. Of course. Right. When you're dealing with radioactive material. But the real concern isn't so much berkelium-249 itself, Okay. but rather what it decays into, californium-249. Ah, right. You know, the alpha emitter. Exactly. So that one's a little bit more intense. Californium-249 requires a whole other level of care and handling in a specialized lab setting. So the parent's kind of tame, but the offspring is a little wild. A little bit, yeah. It's interesting how, you know, it's like a radioactive family tree. Yeah, it really highlights how interconnected the periodic table is. Yeah. And how these elements are constantly transforming. Yeah. But that gradual transformation from berkelium-249 to californium-249 actually presents a unique challenge for researchers. Oh, how so? Well, imagine trying to study a sample of berkelium, but it's slowly changing into californium right in front of you. Oh, wow. It's like a moving target. Yeah. It introduces, you know, chemical contamination. It throws off your measurements. Right. Plus, those alpha particles from californium-249 can actually damage the berkelium sample itself. Really? And generate heat. Wow. So it's like a race against time. It kind of is. But scientists have developed some clever techniques to account for this. You know, taking measurements over time. Right. Extrapolating the data. It's all part of the, you know, challenge and excitement of working with such a unique element. Right. Well, speaking of challenges, we talked about how, you know, the amount of berkelium that's ever been produced is tiny. Yes. Do we have, like, a number on that? Like, how tiny are we talking? Let's just say it makes diamonds look common.
