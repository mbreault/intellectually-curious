## Transcript

Welcome back to our series on modern supply chain methods. Yeah, always great to be back. Today we're tackling a challenge, you know, all too well, demand forecasting. Right. Specifically, how do you use cluster analysis when, like, Swiss cheese, your data is full of holes? Oh, yeah. You've got your spreadsheets ready. You're eager to segment those customers and forecast like a pro. But then, bam, missing data or small sample sizes? Oh. What do you do? It's a more common problem than you might think. Yeah. You know, new product launches, seasonality, all those disruptions we've all been experiencing recently. Yeah. These can lead to gaps in your data. Makes cluster analysis tricky, right? Absolutely. We're talking about grouping similar customers for targeted forecasting. Yeah. But if data is missing, how do you even determine those similarities? Exactly. The article we're diving into today uses this great example of market research consultants, and they're rating client priorities. Okay. And each consultant only rated a subset of statements. So you end up with tons of missing data. So how do you cluster them in any meaningful way? Right. It highlights five different methods, some more effective than others. So let's start with the seemingly easy ones. Okay. Complete case analysis, you just ignore the rows with missing data. Right. Tempting. But is it a good idea? Not really. Okay. It assumes that the data is missing completely at random, or MCAR for short. Meaning the missingness has nothing to do with the data itself. Yeah. This rarely holds true. Okay. Often the fact that data is missing tells us something about those customers or those products. Interesting. You know, the article uses a simple example, eight people, four variables. And you can see how by focusing only on the complete cases, you could miss entire clusters. So ignoring the problem doesn't work. No, it does not. Okay. So what about a variation that SPSS uses complete case analysis followed by nearest neighbor assignment? Right. Does that solve it? Well, it tries to be clever, but it's still built on that shaky complete case foundation. You're forcing data points into clusters based on potentially incomplete information. Right. And again, this can be very misleading. You know, imagine a new product with limited data. Yeah. You could end up with very inaccurate segments. Okay. So no shortcuts there. No. What about replacing missing values with the average for that variable? Right. On the surface, that seems logical. It might, but this can really distort relationships in your data. Okay. Imagine you're clustering customers based on order frequency and average order value. But if someone is missing an order value, replacing it with the average could make them seem more similar to high value customers than they truly are. Right. The article is another good example showing how this leads to kind of artificial similarities, inaccurate segments. So far, the easy fixes are out. Yeah. They're not really fixes, are they? What are the approaches worth exploring? This is where it gets interesting. Okay. Partial data cluster analysis. Okay. You cluster based on what you do know, preserving those actual relationships in the data. That sounds promising. There's a great case study in Displayer's documentation that shows this in action. And the other option is imputation, right? Yes. Filling in those missing values with educated guesses. Precisely. Okay. Think of it as filling in the blanks intelligently. Yeah. But this requires sophisticated tools. Okay. And a very careful approach. So potentially using variables not even in your cluster analysis. Exactly. We're talking about our packages like mice and mice to handle this complexity. Right. Now you mentioned multiple imputation creating several data sets with different guesses for the missing data. Yeah, that's an interesting one. Wouldn't that be even better? It's great for some analyses, but not ideal for cluster analysis. Why is that? You end up with multiple clustering solutions. I see. And there's no statistically sound way to combine them. Okay. So you're left with multiple answers and it's tough to choose the right one definitively. Okay. We've covered a lot of ground here. We have. But let's be honest, you're a busy supply chain professional, not a statistician. Yeah, that's true. How do you actually use this information to make better decisions? That's a great question. Yeah. I think the first step is to really understand your data. How much is missing and where is it missing? Okay. This will tell you about the nature of the problem. So no shame in starting simple, but be aware of the trade-offs. Exactly. If you're limited by software or time and have to use simpler methods, just be very aware of their limitations. Okay. And document your choices carefully. What else should listeners keep in mind? If possible, explore both partial data clustering and imputation and compare the results. Okay. Do they kind of paint a similar picture of your customer segments? So are they telling the same story? They're telling the same story. Yeah. And critically, don't treat those clusters as gospel. Right. They're a starting point for deeper analysis and refining those forecasts. A jumping off point. Exactly. Okay. Yeah. And it's important to remember that even with the best methods, these clusters are a guide, not a crystal ball. You'll still need your expertise to interpret those segments in the context of your supply chain. Right. Because even with perfect segmentation, there's more to forecasting than just grouping customers, right? Oh, absolutely. What other factors come into play? Well, you have to think about things like external forces that can impact demand. For example, you know, economic conditions. Right. A recession could completely change consumer behavior. Yeah. So even the most sophisticated segmentation would be useless if it doesn't consider that kind of shift. I see what you mean. And what about things like competitor actions? Oh, yeah. If a rival suddenly drops their prices, your forecasts could be thrown off no matter how well you've segmented your customers. Absolutely. And then there are all the emerging trends and technologies that constantly reshape the landscape. Yeah. Look at how e-commerce has transformed retail. Your demand forecasting models need to adapt to these changes or you'll fall behind. It's like you need to be able to predict the future, but the rules of the game keep changing. That's a great way to put it. And all of this is compounded by the speed of information today. Right. You know, think about social media sentiment, people sharing their opinions and experiences online in real time. Yeah. That can have an immediate impact on demand. So how do you even begin to capture and analyze all of that? Well, you need tools that go beyond those traditional forecasting methods. Okay. You know, the ones that rely solely on historical data. Yeah. Things like sentiment analysis, social listening tools, even things like weather data can all play a role in improving those forecasts. It sounds like demand forecasting is becoming more complex than ever before. It is. And that's why it's so crucial to have a holistic approach. It's not just about crunching numbers anymore. Okay. You need to understand the broader context. Yeah. The nuances of your market and how all these factors kind of interact with each other. Yeah. And that's where I think human expertise still plays a vital role. You need people who can interpret the data, make those judgment calls, and adjust the models based on their knowledge of the business and the industry. So even with all the advances in technology and data analysis, we can't discount the importance of human intuition and experience. Precisely. It's a balance between leveraging the power of data and algorithms while recognizing the value of human insight. Right. And I think that means fostering a culture of collaboration within your supply chain organization. Okay. You know, supply chain professionals need to work closely with sales, marketing, product development, even finance. Yeah. To get that complete picture of what's driving demand. It's a team effort. Breaking down those silos is essential for creating accurate and reliable forecasts. It is. So as we strive for this perfect data in these sophisticated models, we also need to remember that demand forecasting is both an art and a science. Couldn't agree more. Yeah. And as we kind of wrap up this deep dive, I want to leave you with this thought. Demand forecasting is an ongoing process of continuous improvement. You know, embrace new technologies, stay curious, and always be willing to challenge your assumptions. Because in the world of supply chain management, the only constant is change. And those who can adapt and evolve their forecasting methods will be the ones who thrive. Exactly. But before we move on, let's take a moment to imagine the ideal scenario. What if we could wave a magic wand and eliminate missing data entirely? What kind of possibilities would that unlock in demand forecasting? That's a fascinating question. Yeah. To consider a world without missing data would certainly change the game for demand forecasting. It would be a dream come true for any supply chain professional. Oh, yeah. Imagine the level of precision we could achieve if we had complete and accurate information about every customer, every product, every transaction. It would open up so many possibilities. For one thing, think about hyper-personalized forecasts. Okay. Instead of grouping customers into these broad segments, you could tailor your predictions to their individual needs and preferences. That's right. We could anticipate demand with incredible accuracy, minimizing waste and stockouts while optimizing the entire supply chain. Absolutely. And don't forget about the potential for innovation. Oh, right. With perfect data, you could identify those emerging trends and patterns that were previously hidden. Yeah. You could proactively develop new products and services that perfectly align with those evolving needs and preferences. It would be like having a crystal ball that shows you the future of customer demand. Exactly. But even in that ideal scenario, I believe human intuition and judgment would still play a vital role. Right. We can't discount the importance of experience and expertise when it comes
