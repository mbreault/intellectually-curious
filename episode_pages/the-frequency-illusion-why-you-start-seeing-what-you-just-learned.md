An exploration of the Baader-Meinhoff phenomenon (frequency illusion): how selective attention, confirmation bias, and the recency illusion shape our sense of frequency. Weâ€™ll cover two cognitive accounts, the split category effect, and real-world impacts in science, medicine, data science, and financeâ€”plus practical tips to guard against bias.

## Transcript

Ever notice how after you learn something new, you start seeing it everywhere? Yeah, for sure. That's the frequency illusion. It's also known as the Bader-Meinhof phenomenon. Oh, yeah, I've heard of that. And today we're going to dive into the science behind this illusion. I'm okay. Sounds good. And our source for today is a Wikipedia article simply titled Frequency Illusion. Okay. Pretty straightforward. So this is something that affects everyone. Right. But especially I think those of us in STEM fields, imagine researching a scientific concept. Yeah. And then suddenly you just see it everywhere. Yeah. Like in unrelated papers. Right, right. Or even in casual conversations. It's so weird. And it's all the time. I know. And actually the name Bader-Meinhof phenomenon itself is a great example of the illusion in action. Oh, interesting. Yeah, so back in 1994, someone wrote into a newspaper about repeatedly encountering this name, the name of this German terrorist group. Oh, okay. After they had just learned about it. Right. Makes sense. So it really shows how our brains just become primed to notice certain things. You know, it's not that the name was actually appearing more. Right. But it's just that the reader's focus shifted. Yeah, yeah. Right. And so this is due to something called selective attention. Okay. Which is basically our brain's filter. Gotcha. For the just constant influx of information. Yeah, there's just so much out there. There really is. Think about like you buy a new car. Right. And then suddenly you see that same model everywhere. Uh-huh, classic example. Right. It's not that there are suddenly more of those cars on the road. Right. You're just noticing it more. Exactly. Your brain is just like tuned into it. Yeah, yeah. So it sounds like our brain's kind of filtering what we see, leading us to focus on stuff we've like recently learned. Right. Is that related at all to confirmation bias? Definitely, yeah. Confirmation bias really strengthens this effect. So like once we start to believe that something is more common, we actively like look for evidence to support that belief. Right. Which, you know, just further fuels the illusion. Yeah, yeah. It's like our brain is playing tricks on us. Yeah, in a way. It is, right? Like it's reinforcing this perception. Yeah, exactly. Even though it might not be true. Right. And is this also like tied into the recency illusion? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Okay, so for those who aren't familiar. The recency illusion is this tendency we have to think that things we've noticed recently are new. Okay. Which, you know, it makes sense, right? Because like the more recent something is, the more likely it is that it's actually new. But, you know, that's not always the case. Right, right. And this amplifies the frequency illusion because we tend to give like more weight to those recent experiences. I see. So far we have like, you know, we have selective attention. Right. Which makes us notice things. Yeah. Then we have confirmation bias. Yeah. Solidifying that perception. And then the recency illusion making it all seem new and frequent. Right, exactly. It sounds like a recipe for like powerful cognitive bias. It really is. And there's another element too. Okay, what's that? It's called the split category effect. Okay. And like imagine trying to estimate the number of dogs in a city. Okay. You might give like a general estimate, right? Yeah, for sure. But if you break it down into specific breeds like beagles, poodles, or golden retrievers, the sum of those individual estimates would likely be higher than your initial one. Interesting. It's because like subcategorizing makes us think there are more individual elements within that larger category. Oh, that's a great way to explain it. Yeah. Can you give me an example of how this split category effect relates to the frequency illusion? Sure. So imagine you're a researcher studying a particular protein. Yeah. You might start seeing it mentioned in all sorts of different studies. Right. Leading you to believe that it's like way more important. Than it actually is. So just by like subcategorizing its function. Exactly. We might like overestimate its overall relevance. Yeah, that's the idea. Wow. Now beyond these cognitive biases, are there any like theoretical frameworks? There are actually. That explain, you know, why our brains function this way. Okay, I'm curious. One of them is called cognitive information processing, which suggests that the errors in our frequency judgments are due to how our brains process information. Okay. Especially for those less common events. I see. That sounds super complex. It is. Is there like a simpler way to think about it? Well, think about like trying to grasp the vastness of space. Okay. Our brains like really struggle to comprehend those magnitudes, which leads to errors in our perception of scale and frequency. Okay. We tend to like overestimate the frequency of those rare events. Yeah. Simply because they stand out against, you know, all the common stuff. Right. Makes sense. So it's not like we're intentionally distorting the information. No, not at all. But it's just that our brains have these inherent limitations in processing it, right? Right. Especially when it comes to those less frequent occurrences. Exactly. Wow. And what are the second theory? Right. So the second theory is called the information loss account. Okay. And this theory suggests that the frequency illusions arise from errors in processing, like skewed distributions of information. Okay. Basically, our brains try to simplify all that complex data, which can lead to overestimations of those rare events. Interesting. So it's almost like our brain is trying to create like a balanced picture. Yeah, exactly. Even if that means distorting the actual frequency of things. Right. Think of it as our brain just trying to smooth out the data. Okay. That makes sense. So we're smoothing out the data, but we're potentially creating inaccuracies. Exactly. In our perception of frequency. Wow. And you know, what's really interesting is that this might seem like just like a simple cognitive quirk. Right. But it can have really profound real world implications. Yeah, absolutely. I can imagine. Especially in fields like scientific research or data analysis. For sure. So let's delve into these implications a bit more. Okay, sounds good. Welcome back. All right. So before we kind of got sidetracked with all the cognitive mechanisms of the frequency illusion. Yeah. We were talking about like its potential impact in the real world. Exactly. And, you know, as someone who works with data and analysis daily, I'm like really curious to see how this illusion might affect my work. Yeah. And of course, our listeners work too. For sure. What are some like specific examples of this in STEM fields? So one area where it's really relevant is in scientific research. Okay. Let's say a researcher is studying a particular gene mutation. Uh-huh. After they learn about it, they might start seeing it in like all these different research papers. Right. Creating this perception that it's more common or significant than it actually is. Makes sense. The researcher's focus has kind of shifted. Exactly. Leading them to notice this mutation more frequently. Even if the actual prevalence hasn't changed at all. Right. So it really highlights the importance of being aware of this illusion. Yeah. When we're interpreting research findings. Absolutely. It's crucial to rely on robust statistical data. Right. And not just our perception of frequency. For sure. So it's not just about the data itself, but it's also about how our perception of that data can be like totally skewed by this bias. That's a great point. Another interesting example I can imagine is in the field of medicine. Oh, absolutely. Imagine a doctor who recently went to like a conference on a rare disease. Right. They might start seeing potential cases of that disease. Yeah. Everywhere in their patients. Even if those symptoms could also be attributed to like way more common conditions. Yes, that's true. That's a little concerning, right? It is a bit, yeah. It seems like the frequency illusion could lead to like misdiagnoses. Yeah, that's definitely a possibility. In situations like that. But, you know, it can also have a positive impact in medicine. Okay, how so? Well, once a doctor learns about a rare disease, they become more attuned to its symptoms, which could lead to earlier and more accurate diagnoses in actual cases. So it's kind of like a double-edged sword. Yeah, I think that's a good way to put it. Increasing awareness, but also the potential for bias. Right, you got to find that balance. It underscores the need for doctors to be aware of this bias. For sure. And to really maintain that balance between heightened awareness and objective judgment. Absolutely. Beyond research and medicine, are there other areas in STEM where this illusion plays a role? Oh, yeah, for sure. In data science and machine learning. The frequency illusion can influence the selection of features or variables that are used to train models. Yeah, so if a data scientist gets fixated on a particular variable, they might overestimate its importance in predicting outcomes. That's a great point. So we need to think about using like feature selection techniques to kind of mitigate that potential bias. Right, exactly. And how about something like financial modeling? Oh, yeah, good example. Imagine an analyst tracking a specific economic indicator. Right. They might overestimate its predictive power. Yeah. Just because they've been like super focused on it. Right, they've been watching it so closely. Leading to, you know, potentially bad investment decisions. Absolutely. It sounds like this illusion can have some pretty serious consequences. Yeah, it can. In fields where data interpretation
