## Transcript

All right, let's dive deep into the liver bird, this iconic symbol of Liverpool. You know, everyone wants to know more about its history, the myths, what it means to people there. Right. And we've got a ton of material to really dig into. Articles about Liverpool's history landmarks, even a look at how the liver bird shows up in pop culture. Yeah, and we'll be pulling in some insights from pieces about what the liver bird represents to the city itself. So to get started, let's go back to the very beginning. We're talking the 13th century, 1207 to be exact. King John's granting Liverpool its royal charter needs a seal for official documents. And what does he choose? A bird. Now, this bird wasn't necessarily the liver bird as we know it today. Most likely an eagle representing John the Evangelist, who was King John's patron saint. Basically a figure of special significance to him. The seal also includes a sprig of broom, a symbol of the Plantagenet dynasty, the royal family John belonged to, and even a star and crescent moon, one of his personal badges. So right from the start, this bird is linked to royalty and authority. But as we move forward in time, that eagle starts changing. It morphs into something called a lever or a cormorant, which is more like what we think of as the liver bird. How did that happen? Well, language is constantly changing. You know, words shift their meanings and interpretations evolve. In this case, the term lever was likely a medieval term for a type of water bird, which over time became associated with the specific image on the seal. It makes you wonder if people back then started to see the eagle on the seal more as this lever bird, because the way language was changing. It's possible, yeah. And there's another fascinating twist. Remember that sprig of broom on the original seal? Well, that transformed into laver seaweed. Now, laver is a type of edible seaweed found locally. Okay, I see where this is going. A visual pun on Liverpool. That's pretty clever. It is, and it suggests a deliberate effort to connect the bird more directly to the city. Instead of just being a symbol of royal authority, it's becoming something unique to Liverpool. And it's not just the image that's changing. The stories about the liver bird are evolving too. Speaking of stories, we can't talk about the liver bird without mentioning those iconic statues on top of the Royal Liver Building. Bella and Birdie, right? Yes. The Royal Liver Building was completed in 1911. And those statues perched high above the city really solidified the liver bird's place in people's minds. They weren't just looking at an old seal anymore. They had these imposing figures watching over them. They are pretty impressive. 18 feet tall with a 24-foot wingspan. Seeing them for the first time back then must have been quite something. Did people start to think of them as protectors of the city? It's certainly possible. Think about it. Liverpool was a bustling port city at the time. A gateway to the world, but also a place of danger and uncertainty, especially for those who made their living at sea. Having these mythical creatures looking out over the city could have been a source of comfort and reassurance. That makes a lot of sense. And those legends about Bella and Birdie really play into that idea of protection, don't they? Bella gazing out to sea, watching over sailors while Birdie keeps an eye on things back home. And of course, there's always that touch of Liverpudlian humor in those legends. Right, like Birdie making sure everyone's behaving themselves at the pubs. Exactly. It adds a lighthearted element to the myths, reminding us that even these mythical creatures are connected to the everyday lives of the people. But the legends have a darker side, too. One myth suggests that if the birds ever mate and fly away, Liverpool will cease to exist. That's a pretty high-stakes myth. It is. And then there's the one about them being chained down because if they escape, the Mersey will flood. It seems like there's a real mix of hope and fear tied up in these stories. Hope that the birds will protect the city, but fear of what might happen if they leave or lose control. That tension is definitely there. And it reflects a deeper connection between the people of Liverpool and the River Mersey, this powerful force that has shaped so much of their history and identity. It's incredible how those statues on the Royal Liver Building have become almost like the definitive image of the liver bird. But they're not alone, are they? There are liver birds all over Liverpool. Oh, absolutely. And they're not all grand and imposing like Bella and Birdie. They come in all shapes and sizes and are tucked away in all sorts of places. It makes you wonder if those statues on the Royal Liver Building inspired people to incorporate the liver bird into different parts of the city, almost like they were saying, we want our own piece of this symbol, this protector. That's a fascinating thought. And it really speaks to how deeply ingrained the liver bird is in the fabric of the city. For example, there's a stone liver bird at the Museum of Liverpool that was originally from the old St. John's Market. And then there's that really cool 3D sculpture on Water Street. And let's not forget the one at the entrance to the Queensway Tunnel, almost looks like it's waving goodbye. It's like a treasure hunt for anyone visiting the city, trying to spot all the different liver birds. It is. And each one has its own story to tell its own connection to the people and places of Liverpool. Speaking of stories, did you know there was even a British sitcom called The Liver Birds? It aired in the 70s and had a revival in the 90s. Yes. It was about two young women sharing a flat in Liverpool. The title itself is a nod to the liver bird statues, Bella and Birdie, and their contrasting personalities. It seems like the liver bird has really permeated popular culture. And it's not always without controversy, is it? Think about that time Liverpool FC tried to trademark the liver bird. That sparked quite a debate. It did. The city council pushed back pretty hard, arguing that the liver bird belongs to everyone in Liverpool, not just one organization. That really highlights how important the liver bird is to the entire city. It's a symbol of shared heritage, a source of civic pride, and something that goes beyond any one group or entity. It's amazing how something that started as a simple mark on a seal has evolved into such a powerful symbol. From royal connections to local legends to pop culture references and even trademark disputes, the liver bird has really taken flight. It has. And that journey tells us a lot about how symbols can change and adapt, taking on new meanings and becoming intertwined with the lives of the people who embrace them. But we've only just scratched the surface. There's so much more to discover about the liver bird and its impact on the city of Liverpool. We'll be back after a short break to delve deeper into the world of the liver bird. We've been exploring the history and the legends surrounding the liver bird. But now I'm curious about its deeper significance. What does this symbol truly represent to the people of Liverpool? That's a great question. It's like asking what any powerful symbol means. The answers are going to be as diverse as the people themselves. But we can definitely see some common threads. For many Liverpudlians, the liver bird embodies a sense of protection. Almost like a guardian angel watching over the city. Precisely. Think about those legends we discussed. Bella looking out for the sailors while Birdie safeguards those on land. It speaks to a desire for safety and security, especially in a city so closely tied to the sea where danger was a constant reality. That makes sense. And it goes beyond just physical safety, doesn't it? There's an element of emotional security too, a feeling of belonging and being looked after. Absolutely. That sense of community is a big part of what the liver bird represents. It's a symbol that unites people from all walks of life, reminding them that they're part of something larger than themselves. Beyond protection, the liver bird also seems to represent Liverpool's rich history and its maritime heritage. Definitely. Liverpool has always been a city shaped by the sea, a global hub for trade and cultural exchange. The liver bird, often depicted with seaweed in its beak, serves as a constant visual reminder of that connection. It's like the bird itself embodies that spirit of adventure and exploration that's so central to Liverpool's identity. And that sense of pride in their history and heritage is something that Liverpudlians carry with them. The liver bird is a badge of honor, a way of saying, this is where I'm from and I'm proud of it. You see that pride manifested in so many ways, from the liver bird tattoos to the countless souvenirs featuring the bird's image. It's become synonymous with the city itself. And that strong association has real-world implications, particularly when it comes to the city's economy and tourism. It's interesting to think about the liver bird as a brand almost. People come from all over the world to see those statues, buy those souvenirs, and experience the city that the liver bird represents. You're right. That kind of cultural capital is invaluable. It draws people in and boosts the local economy. But the liver bird's influence extends beyond just Liverpool. It's become internationally recognized as a symbol of the city putting Liverpool on the map and contributing to its global image. It's fascinating how this mythical creature has had such a tangible impact on the real world. This bird is more than just a pretty face. It's a force to be reckoned with. It shapes the city's identity, its economy, even its reputation on the world stage. And that speaks to the enduring power of symbols. They have the ability to transcend time and space to connect us to something larger than
