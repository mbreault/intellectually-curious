Learn about OEIS A000104

## Transcript

Welcome back to our deep dive into the OEIS. You know it, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Today, we're going to be tackling A000104, which might sound a bit abstract at first, free polyominoes without holes. It does have that kind of ring to it, doesn't it? But like many of the sequences we look at, it hides a surprising amount of complexity. Yeah, it does seem like that's kind of a recurring theme with the OEIS. Simple rules, but then you get these fascinating mathematical rabbit holes you can just dive right into. Oh, absolutely. And A000104 is like a prime example. It's really all about counting how many different ways you can arrange squares, you know, edge to edge to form a solid shape, no gaps allowed. So, kind of like Tetris pieces. Yeah. But they can be any shape, as long as there's no holes in the middle. So those are our free polyominoes without holes. Exactly. Think of it like dominoes, right? Those are like two-celled polyominoes. Then you have your trominoes with three squares to trominoes with four, like in Tetris and so on. And the sequence A000104 lists out, like, how many unique shapes you can make for each number of squares. I'm looking at the entry now. And the first few terms are 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 12, 35, 107. Those numbers get big fast. They really do. They explode in size so quickly. You know, it's a phenomenon we call combinatorial explosion. Wait, so you're saying there are like over 100 different ways to arrange just seven squares together? There are. And it just keeps getting more complex. It's kind of wild how this seemingly simple act of just connecting squares reveals just how many possibilities, like, spiral out of control as we add more squares. It does make sense, though, right? I mean, I can already imagine just thinking about it, how tricky it must get to figure out all the different shapes. Especially as you get into those larger numbers of squares. Yeah. It's definitely not something you can just do with, like, pencil and paper after a certain point. Mathematicians, they have to rely on algorithms and computer programs just to even begin to count these things. So there's no, like, easy formula. You can't just plug in a number and it calculates the next number in the sequence. Unfortunately not, no. That's what makes the sequence so challenging. And honestly, it's why it's still an active area of research even today. So how do they do it, then? Like, how do they actually count these shapes when they get so complex? Well, it's a pretty fascinating blend of, you know, math and computer science. There are, like, a few different approaches, but even the most efficient algorithms kind of, they struggle as the number of squares increases. I mean, the OEIS entry, it lists the sequence up to 28 squares. So they've mapped out, what, millions of unique shapes? Yeah, they have, which is honestly pretty amazing. It's a real testament to the power of computational techniques. But, you know, even with all that, finding the next number in the sequence, so the number of distinct polyominoes with 29 squares, it's still an open problem. Wow, that's incredible. Like, this deceptively simple concept, it just keeps unfolding, right? Deeper and deeper layers of complexity. It does. It really highlights the, like, the beauty of number theory. You start with something that seems so basic, you know, it's just connecting squares, and it leads to these, like, really profound questions that just push the boundaries of what we understand, even our computational abilities. It also makes me think about, like, real-world implications. We've talked about Tetris, but are there other areas where understanding these polyomino shapes is actually useful? Like, does this have applications outside of just, you know, theoretical math? Oh, there are. Believe it or not, polyomino enumeration, it has applications in fields like chemistry and computer science. Okay, now that's really surprising. How so? Well, like in chemistry, imagine molecules as polyominoes. Understanding how, you know, how different atoms can bond together to form specific shapes, that can really help chemists predict the properties of new molecules or design more efficient reactions. So the way those atoms connect, their structure, it's like arranging squares into those different polyominoes. That's a cool analogy. Yeah, it is. And then, like, in computer science, you know, polyominoes come up in problems related to packing and tiling. So think about things like optimizing data storage on a hard drive or designing, you know, the most efficient layout for components on a circuit board. So understanding how to fit these shapes together, like in the most efficient way, it has practical applications in how we design and build technology. Exactly. Yeah, it might seem abstract at first, but the seemingly simple act of counting polyominoes, it really does open doors to solving some pretty real-world problems in a lot of diverse fields. This has been a real eye-opener, you know. I came into this thinking we were just going to be talking about arranging squares, but A000104, it touches on so much more. It really does, and that's the beauty of the OEIS, right? It's a gateway to all these interconnected areas of mathematics, and A000104 is like a perfect example. It highlights not just the elegance of, you know, combinatorial thinking, but also, like, the power that it has in solving problems, real-world problems. It also makes you realize how much we just don't know. We're talking about connecting squares, like something a child can understand, and yet we still haven't figured out how many unique shapes you can make with 29 squares. Yeah, exactly. And who knows what other mysteries are hidden within, you know, what seem like simple concepts just waiting to be uncovered. That's what makes number theory so exciting. Well said. I think we've done a good job navigating this world of free polyominoes without holes and found some pretty fascinating insights along the way. Any final thoughts for our listeners before we wrap up this deep dive into A000104? Well, you know, if this sequence has piqued your curiosity, I really encourage you to explore the OEIS further. There are countless other sequences out there, and each one has its own, like, story to tell, you know, hidden depths to explore. You never know what you might find, what mathematical rabbit hole you might stumble upon next. That's a great suggestion. And hey, maybe one of our listeners will be the one to finally crack the code, figure out how many 29-celled polyominoes there are out there. Until next time, keep exploring the fascinating world of numbers.
