## Description

A close look at space blanketsâ€”the lightweight Mylar sheets that trap heat and reflect heat away. We explore how biaxially oriented BOPET film, aluminum metallization, and surface texture give them their heat-shielding powers, their NASA origins from Skylab to Echo 2, and practical uses for hikers, campers, and amateur scientists today.

## Transcript

Ever notice how some of the simplest things can be the most useful? Like, think about paperclips or duct tape, you know? Just incredibly practical. Today we're gonna delve into another one of those surprisingly versatile items, the space blanket. Oh, definitely. Yeah, I mean, at first glance, a space blanket might just look like a flimsy, quickly sheet of foil, really. But there's a lot more to it than meets the eye. There's actually some fascinating material science behind these things, and a history that traces back to the early days of space exploration. For real. We're gonna take a deep dive today into how they actually work and all the different situations where they can really be a lifesaver or just a really handy tool to have around, especially for the amateur scientist. Absolutely, because like you said, they're lightweight, compact, and surprisingly effective for a variety of purposes. Exactly. So for this deep dive, we've gathered info from a bunch of different sources, scientific papers, survival guides, NASA documents, you name it. Wow, sounds comprehensive. We're talking about the materials they're made of, the physics behind why they work so well, their origins at NASA, and all the unexpected ways they're used. We're aiming to get a complete picture of this simple yet effective technology. I like it. Unraveling the mysteries of the space blanket. Exactly. So, first things first, what is a space blanket? Good question. I mean, most people have probably seen them or at least heard of them. They go by a whole bunch of different names. Yeah, you'll hear them called space blankets, mylar blankets, emergency blankets, thermal blankets, sometimes even just foil blankets. Right, right. But regardless what you call them, the one thing that's immediately apparent is how incredibly lightweight and compact they are. Like they fold down to practically nothing. Oh, for sure. Definitely a big plus for portability. Absolutely. And their primary function is pretty much summed up by the name thermal blanket. They're designed to minimize heat loss from the body. Makes sense. Now this happens through a few different processes, which to be honest are at play all the time. There's thermal radiation, which is basically like the heat you feel radiating off a hot stove. Then there's evaporation of moisture, which is how sweating rolls you down. And then there's convection, which is heat transfer through the movement of air or fluids. Space blankets are designed to address all three of these. So they're kind of like a multi-pronged approach to staying warm? Exactly. You know, when you first see that shiny surface, it's easy to assume it's just like regular kitchen foil, but I'm guessing it's a bit more sophisticated than that. Oh yeah, definitely a bit more going on there. The real star of the show here is a special type of plastic film called biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate. Biaxially oriented what now? Yeah, it's a mouthful. We can just call it BOPET for short. Okay, BOPET still doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. True, true. But you might be more familiar with one of its trade names, Mylar. Oh, okay, Mylar. Yeah, I've heard of that. Right, you might also see it as Melanex, Lumir, or Hostapham. But essentially, it's all the same stuff, BOPET. And it's important to note, this isn't just your typical flimsy plastic wrap. BOPET film has been stretched in a very specific way during manufacturing, and that's what gives it its unique properties. Interesting. We're talking about a polyester film. I know that's used in things like plastic bottles. What makes the polyester in a space blanket so special? Right, so it's the biaxially oriented part that's key here. Imagine taking a piece of cafe and stretching it, not just lengthwise, but widthwise at the same time. That's essentially what's happening with BOPET, but at a molecular level. The long chains of polymers that make up the material were aligned in two directions parallel to the surface of the film. And this biaxial orientation has a huge impact on its properties. Okay, so how does stretching it in two directions make it so much different from regular polyester film? Well, for starters, it makes it way stronger and less likely to tear. It also boosts its chemical stability so it doesn't degrade as easily. And then there's its dimensional stability, which means it won't shrink or stretch out of shape when the temperature changes. So it's basically tougher and more resilient than your average plastic film. That makes sense for something that's supposed to be used in emergency situations. Absolutely. And in its base form, BOPET is transparent. But of course, space blankets have that characteristic metallic sheen that comes from a process called metallization, where a very thin layer of metal, usually aluminum, is deposited onto one side of the film. Aha, so that's what gives it that mirror-like finish. Exactly. This metallic layer does a few things. First, it makes the BOPET much less permeable to gases, which can be important for certain applications. But most importantly, it makes it highly reflective. Like some sources say it can reflect up to 99% of light, including a good chunk of the infrared spectrum. 99%? That's impressive. It is. And the infrared spectrum is just heat energy, so that's what gives space blankets their thermal properties. Sometimes other metals like gold are used, but aluminum is the most common because it's cheap and very reflective. I see. So it's this combination of the BOPET and the metallization that creates the unique properties of the space blanket. Exactly. Now, I've noticed that these blankets sometimes feel kind of powdery. Is there a reason for that? Good observation. That's because if BOPET film were made completely smooth, the layers would actually stick together when rolled up, like two pieces of really clean glass. To avoid that, manufacturers add microscopic particles, often silicon dioxide, to the film during production. These particles are inert, meaning they don't react with anything, and they create tiny bumps on the surface that prevent the layers from clinging to each other. Ah, that makes sense. It's like giving the surface a little bit of texture. Exactly. So we've talked about the materials. Now let's get into how they actually work. From what I understand, the shiny surface acts like a mirror reflecting heat energy. Is that right? That's the basic idea. It reflects infrared radiation, which is heat. So if you wrap yourself in a space blanket with a shiny side facing in, it reflects your own body heat back towards you, helping you stay warm. Like a personal heat shield. Exactly. And if you flip it around and face the shiny side out, it reflects external heat sources like the sun, which can help keep you cool. Wow, so it's like a two-way heat manager. Pretty much, yeah. And this brings us to their origin story, which I found really interesting. These blankets weren't originally intended for campers and hikers, right? Nope, not at all. Their roots are firmly in the space program. Space blankets were first developed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center back in 1964. For the U.S. space program? Uh-huh. Wow, that's pretty cool. Yeah. Back then, the focus was on thermal control for spacecraft. The extreme temperatures in space meant that NASA needed to figure out ways to either retain heat or reflect it away, depending on the situation. And they needed a solution that was lightweight and effective. Of course, weight is a major factor in space travel. Every ounce counts. For sure. And that's where space blankets came in. One of the most dramatic examples of them in action was during the Skylab mission in 1973. I've heard about that. Didn't Skylab, the first U.S. space station, have a problem with overheating? A major problem, yeah. A critical part of its heat shield was damaged during launch, and this caused the internal temperature to skyrocket. We're talking 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Yikes. That's not exactly comfortable working conditions. Not at all. And more importantly, it was a serious threat to the mission. The engineers were worried about the equipment malfunctioning, the food spoiling, and even the possibility of toxic gases being released. So what did they do? They needed a quick fix, a way to reflect the sun's heat away from the station. So they turned to National Metallizing, a company that had been working with metallized films. For space applications? Not exactly. Up to that point, they'd mostly used metallization for, believe it or not, things like toys and Christmas decorations. Really? That's a far cry from saving a space station. It is, but NASA recognized the potential of these shiny, thin, metallic sheets for reflecting heat. So they worked with National Metallizing to create a giant reflective parasol made of, you guessed it, metallized BOPET. Wow. And it worked. Like a charm. The Skylab crew had to do some tricky maneuvers during spacewalks to deploy it, but once it was in place, it brought the station's temperature back down to a safe level. Incredible. It's amazing to think that something designed to save a space station is now a common item in emergency kits. So this was the origin of the space blanket as we know it. Yeah, you could say that. Skylab was a real turning point. It proved that this technology could be used effectively in real-world situations, not just theoretical ones. And it paved the way for the widespread adoption of space blankets for all sorts of purposes. Fascinating. Aside from Skylab, were there any other early uses of Mylar in space? Oh, absolutely. Even before Skylab, NASA launched Echo 2 in 1964, which was this huge balloon, 40 meters in diameter, made from a very thin Mylar film sandwiched between layers of aluminum foil.
