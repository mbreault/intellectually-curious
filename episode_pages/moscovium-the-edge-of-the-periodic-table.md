## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. Ready to dive into something truly extraordinary? I think we've got something pretty special lined up for this deep dive. Today, we're venturing into the world of moscovium, element 115 on the periodic table. Ah, moscovium. Now, that's not one you hear about every day. Not at all. It's synthetic, super heavy, and so radioactive that it makes uranium look tame. We're talking about an element that pushes the boundaries of what we know about matter. And so elusive that much of our understanding is based on predictions and really quick calculations. Oh, yeah. It doesn't exist naturally. It's got to be created in a lab, atom by atom. Atom by atom, wow. And even then, we're talking about fractions of a second of existence. Fleeting glimpses. That's what we get with moscovium. So, how do scientists even create something like that? I came across this thing about smashing atoms together, which, well, sounds kind of chaotic. It does sound a bit dramatic, doesn't it? Yeah. But there's a lot of precision involved. We take ions of americium, that's element 95, and calcium, element 20. And then we use a particle accelerator to ramp them up to crazy high speeds. Like a super-powered atomic demolition derby. You could say that. When those ions collide with just the right energy, there's a chance they'll fuse together. And that's how you get moscovium. Bingo. A brand new, heavier nucleus. It's amazing, really, that we can even manipulate stuff on such a tiny scale. But I gotta ask, are we creating tons of moscovium this way? Not exactly. Ah, figured as much. It's not the easiest process, you see. The chances of those atoms fusing are, well, pretty slim. I can imagine. Scientists call this the cross-section of the reaction, the probability of it happening. Think of it like hitting a bullseye on a dartboard that's constantly moving. And you only have a split second to throw the dart. Exactly. Only a handful of moscovium atoms have ever been created, which makes studying it a monumental challenge. That brings us to something I've always been fascinated by, the island of stability. Ah, yes. One of the most intriguing ideas in nuclear physics. It's this theoretical region where certain super-heavy elements, like moscovium, could be much more stable, right? That's the idea. Some combinations of protons and neutrons might just hit the sweet spot. And instead of fractions of a second, we might be talking minutes, days, even years. It's mind-blowing to think about. Imagine a moscovium isotope that sticks around long enough to really study. That would be incredible. But why do we think moscovium is near this island? What's so special about it? Well, we have to look at its place on the periodic table. Moscovium sits right below bismuth in the nitrogen group. Okay, right. Elements in the same group usually share some family resemblances, chemically speaking. You got it. But with super-heavy elements, it's not that straightforward. Because things get really wild down there at the bottom of the periodic table. Exactly. Super-heavy nuclei are incredibly dense, and their electrons are zipping around at a good chunk of the speed of light. Talk about a high-energy environment. It leads to what we call relativistic effects, which can really shake things up in terms of an element's behavior. So the rules change when we're dealing with these heavyweights. You could say that. One of these relativistic effects is called the inert pair effect. Inert pair? What's that all about? Imagine moscovium's outermost electrons being so drawn to the nucleus, with its massive positive charge, that they're almost reluctant to bond with anything. Like they're too busy hanging on to dear life. It makes moscovium act quite differently from its lighter family members in the nitrogen group. So it's not just its size, it's the crazy physics happening inside the atom that makes it so fascinating. Absolutely. And it gets even weirder. Because of these relativistic effects, moscovium might even behave like an alkali metal under certain conditions. Wait, hold on. Alkali metal, like sodium or potassium? You sound strange, I know. But it all comes down to that single, loosely bound outer electron, just like the alkali metals have. Wow. So we have this element that might be near the island of stability, could have longer-lived isotopes, and its behavior is all over the place, thanks to these mind-bending relativistic effects. Moscovium definitely keeps us on our toes. It sounds like it's breaking all the rules of the periodic table as we know them. It's a bridge between our classical understanding of chemistry and the extreme world of super-heavy elements. And that bridge leads to some really interesting questions. Like, what actually are moscovium's chemical properties? How does it react? How does it bond? Those are the million-dollar questions. And the real challenge is, how do you study something that exists for less than a second? That's what I want to know. How do they even begin to figure this stuff out? Well, that's where the real ingenuity of these scientists comes in. I am all ears. Tell me, what kinds of tricks do they have up their sleeves? One of the most amazing experiments just happened this year, actually. Oh, wow. At the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Germany. Catchy name. They managed to study how moscovium sticks to gold surfaces. Wait a minute, you mean like they got individual atoms of moscovium to, like, stick to gold? That's right. But how is that even possible? We're talking about something that blinks out of existence in a fraction of a second. It's pretty remarkable. They used this technique called gas-phase chromatography. Okay. And they combined it with a detection system that can literally see a single atom. Wow. So they made this stream of moscovium atoms and sent it through this special column coated with gold. I see. And by tweaking the temperature and other conditions, they could observe how moscovium interacted with gold. So it's like they're manipulating these atoms with incredible precision. It really is. So what did they learn from this? Did it back up any of those predictions about moscovium's behavior? It did, actually. They found that moscovium is less reactive than bismuth, which is its lighter counterpart in the nitrogen group. Okay. But it's more reactive than copernicium and fluorovium, even heavier elements in the same group. So it falls somewhere in the middle. Right. Why is that so important? Well, it's like direct proof of those relativistic effects we were talking about earlier. Right. You know, those super speedy electrons in moscovium, they're being tugged around by the massive nucleus. And that directly affects how it interacts with other elements. Fascinating. This experiment gave us a glimpse into the chemistry of an element we barely understand. It's like they're piecing together a puzzle one atom at a time. That's a great way to put it. And revealing this whole new picture of chemistry at the edge of the periodic table. Exactly. And it makes you wonder what other surprises are waiting out there as we explore these super heavy elements. Yeah. What if we could actually reach that island of stability and make isotopes that last for hours or days? Can you imagine what we could learn then? It would completely change our understanding of moscovium and its neighbors. Absolutely. More stable isotopes would certainly make things a bit easier, wouldn't they? Definitely. But even with all the progress we've made, there are still some big challenges when it comes to studying these super heavy elements. Like what? Well, just creating enough of the element to study is a huge hurdle. Yeah. It's not like you can just whip up a batch of moscovium in a beaker. We're talking about atoms created just a few at a time. Even figuring out basic things like melting point or boiling point becomes a huge task. I guess it's kind of like trying to understand a rare gemstone. Uh-huh. When you only have a few tiny grains to work with. That's a perfect analogy. And then there's the equipment. Oh, right. I bet those experiments require some pretty specialized gear. Oh, absolutely. We're talking powerful particle accelerators to smash those atoms together at insane speeds. I can imagine. And super sensitive detectors to even catch a glimpse of those reactions. So exploring this world of super heavy elements requires a lot of brain power and serious resources. You could say that. And even when you have all that, you're still battling with predicting how these elements will behave. Because of those relativistic effects we talked about. Exactly. They can really throw a wrench in our traditional understanding of chemistry. So you need the tools and you need to rethink the rules. That's right. It's like we're rewriting the textbook as we go further down the periodic table. And we can't forget about the elephant in the room. The radioactivity. Oh, yeah. These super heavy elements are intensely radioactive. That must make things even trickier. For sure. Safety is absolutely paramount. Researchers have to work in specialized labs. I bet. With strict protocols, shielded equipment, remote handling techniques. It's a high-stakes game, pushing the limits of our knowledge, but with real risks involved. It sounds like a constant balancing act. It is. But with all those challenges, what would you say are some of the biggest wins that have come from this research? Well, for me, one of the most exciting breakthroughs has been getting closer to proving the island of stability. Oh, yeah. The discovery of elements like fluorovium and livermorium. They
