## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. Ready to dive into some quirky physics from 2024. Absolutely. Always up for exploring the more offbeat side of physics. Yeah, I think it's a good reminder that physics isn't just about the big, like black holes or quantum mechanics, but it's also in the everyday stuff around us. Right, and Physics World Magazine always does a great job of highlighting those fun, quirky applications of physics. Yeah, and those are exactly what we'll be diving into today. So where are we headed first on this deep dive? Well, how about we start with something everyone loves? Champagne. Sounds good to me. Specifically, the physics of that iconic pop when you open a bottle. Ah, yes. Researchers in Austria actually used high-speed cameras and get this, they studied the formation of a mock disk as the cork pops out. A mock disk? Yeah, it's a supersonic shockwave. They found by analyzing it, you can actually determine the pressure inside the bottle before it was opened. Wow, so next time I'm popping a bottle, I'll be thinking about those supersonic shockwaves escaping. Me too. Though maybe not quite as glamorous, some other researchers looked into, well, cicada pee. Cicada pee, that sounds interesting. Yeah, they found these cicadas don't just pee normally, they actually expel it in these high-speed jets. High-speed, I mean, they're so small, how do they manage that? Well, that's the thing. Scientists always thought it would be impossible for insects that size to do that because of surface tension. Oh, right, surface tension. But it turns out these cicadas evolved a way around that. They use what's called super propulsion. Okay, I have to ask, how does that work? Super propulsion. Basically, they create these tiny, really well-timed pulses of fluid, and when those pulses come together, they form a much larger, more powerful jet. It's actually pretty amazing. Wow, so nature found a way to make a pee jet. That's something. Yeah, and it's more than just a cool fact. Think about the potential applications, maybe even for biomimicry. We could design more efficient nozzles for everything from printers to medical devices. It's crazy how these little things can lead to big innovations. But let's shift gears from pee to a more, shall we say, enjoyable beverage. Beer. Oh, right, the research from Belgium. They were using machine learning, right, to study beer? Exactly. They actually analyzed the flavor profiles of over 250 different beers, and by combining the chemical data with tasting notes, they trained an AI model to actually predict how a beer will taste. So basically, they're teaching AI to be a beer connoisseur. Kind of. It makes you wonder, could AI design the perfect beer someday? Possibly. This research definitely opens up some exciting avenues for breweries. Like, imagine creating new flavors or even making really good alcohol-free beers. Yeah, it's really cool how physics, with some help from computer science and chemistry, can impact something as enjoyable as beer. It goes to show, physics really is everywhere. It really is. But speaking of things that are not so enjoyable, how about we talk about paper cuts? Paper cuts, those are a classic. Everyone's experienced them. Exactly. And some researchers in Denmark actually decided to study the mechanics behind them. I mean, you wouldn't think there'd be much to study, but... Right. But it turns out the thickness of the paper is really important. If it's too thin, it buckles instead of cutting cleanly. And if it's too thick, it just indents the skin. So there's a sweet spot for paper cut pain. Yeah, apparently. There's a thickness that gives you the perfect paper cut. Ouch. But I read they took this research even further and actually built something called a paper machete. It's true. They 3D printed it, and the cutting edge is made of, you guessed it, paper. Wow, so they turned a paper cut into a tool. Pretty much. Shows you, even something annoying can lead to some interesting innovations. Okay, how about we move on to something a little more abstract, like quantum mechanics? Sure. Though I think we all agree that quantum mechanics can be pretty intimidating. Yeah, it can be really hard to wrap your head around. But there's this really cool initiative happening in Germany, in Dresden, that's trying to make quantum mechanics more accessible to the public. Have you heard of the Kitty Q Escape Room? Oh yeah, that sounds familiar. It's based on Schrodinger's cat, right? Exactly. You have to solve puzzles based on actual quantum principles to figure out if Kitty Q is alive or dead. I love that idea. Using games to teach about complicated science. Me too. It's a fun and interactive way to introduce people to something that might otherwise seem too complex. Definitely. And you know, speaking of complex ideas, have you ever heard of the infinite monkey theorem? Yeah. The idea that if a monkey typed randomly for an eternity, eventually it would write Shakespeare. It's a pretty classic thought experiment. And some Australian mathematicians decided to put it to the test. Really? How did they do that? Well, they used computer models to simulate monkeys typing randomly. They wanted to see, could they really produce Shakespeare? What were the results? Well, they found that even with a whole army of monkeys typing nonstop for like the entire lifespan of the universe, the chances of them writing all of Shakespeare's works are still incredibly low. So basically you're saying relying on monkey labor to write a masterpiece probably won't work. Pretty much. It seems real creativity needs a bit more than just random chance. Well, that's probably a relief to all the writers out there. Definitely. It does seem that way, yeah. You know, while we're talking about physics in the public, we can't forget about the U.S. Postal Service's contribution this year. Oh, yeah. Those stamps with the images from the James Webb Space Telescope. Yeah. Those were really neat. Definitely. And they're more than just pretty pictures too. It's a big deal for bringing science to the public eye. Like, you've got images of the cosmic cliffs, the pillars of creation. Right. It's a way of showing that these wonders of the universe, they're not just for scientists. They're for everyone to enjoy. It's a great way to bring art and science together too. I mean, who knew sending a letter could get you thinking about nebula? And speaking of making science accessible, I keep thinking about that quantum escape room in Dresden. It's a really creative approach, isn't it? Using games to make complex topics more engaging, like you said. Yeah. It makes you realize learning doesn't always have to be about textbooks. Sometimes you need to experience it. But let's get back to fluids for a second. We've talked about champagne and cicada pee, but what about squirting cucumbers? What's going on there? Well, it's a pretty amazing example of how nature solves problems. You know, when the cucumbers ripe, it basically blasts its seeds out in this high-pressure jet of, well, mucilage. Yeah, I've seen videos. It's pretty wild. It is. Researchers in the UK did a whole study on it, high-speed cameras, math modeling, the works. And they found out that pressure builds up inside the fruit, but then some of that fluid goes into the stem right before launch, makes it longer and stiffer. Oh, so it's like priming the launch. Exactly. It helps the fruit rotate so the seeds are launched at the best angle to travel as far as possible. Clever. It's incredible how these plants figure that out. It's like they've got their own little physics labs going on. Right. Speaking of efficiency, we have to mention the research on whirligig beetles. Those little guys are crazy fast swimmers. Yeah, I read they can move like 100 times their body lengths every second. That's insane. It is, right? It turns out they use lift-based thrusts to do it. Something we used to think only much bigger animals could do. Like dolphins. Exactly. So basically, these tiny beetles are flying underwater. That's so cool. It really shows you just how diverse life is and all the different ways physics comes into play. Okay, ready for something a little more down to earth? How about pistachios? Pistachios? What about them? Well, some physicists in France decided to tackle a question that's actually relevant to things like how particles pack together. Think granular materials, even cells. Okay, I'm intrigued. What was the question? It's a simple one. How much space do you need to store leftover pistachio shells? You know, after you've eaten a bowl of them. Huh, I never thought about that. So what did they find? Turns out the best container size depends on how tightly the pistachios were packed to begin with. Tightly packed nuts only need a container about half the size. Loosely packed, more like three quarters. So there's a science to pistachio shell storage. Who knew? Right. It's proof you can find physics everywhere, even in a bowl of nuts. I guess that's true. It also shows how simple questions can lead to insights into some pretty fundamental principles. You know what, I'd love to hear a bit more about that Kitty Q escape room. Like, how did they actually turn quantum mechanics into, well, an escape room? It's really interesting, actually. The team who made it, they're called the CT.MAT team, and they actually started with a mobile app called Kitty Q. Oh, so they adapted the app for the escape room. Yeah, they took those concepts and brought them into the real world. So you have four different rooms to explore with 17 puzzles in total. And each puzzle focuses on a specific quantum idea. So instead of, like, equations and stuff, you're actually
