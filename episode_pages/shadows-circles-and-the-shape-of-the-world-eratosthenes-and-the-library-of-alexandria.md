## Description

A journey to ancient Alexandria and Syene where Eratosthenes, head librarian, uses a simple shadow and a distance measured by bematists to estimate Earth's circumference with astonishing accuracy. This episode explores how cross-disciplinary curiosityâ€”from geometry to surveying to astronomyâ€”redefined our understanding of the world and highlighted the Library of Alexandria as a crucible of ideas.

## Transcript

All right, buckle up because today's deep dive takes us straight back to ancient Egypt. It sounds impossible, right? We're talking about a time long before GPS, satellites, even reliable maps. Imagine, if you can, trying to figure out the size of the entire Earth with nothing but your brain and a few simple tools. But that's exactly what a brilliant scholar named Eratosthenes did, and with startling accuracy. It's a story that takes us to the heart of the Library of Alexandria, one of the greatest centers of learning the world has ever known. Think of it, scholars from all corners of the known world gathered in this bustling hub of knowledge, debating, sharing discoveries, pushing the boundaries of what was possible. You've probably heard of it, a treasure trove of scrolls and a magnet for the sharpest minds of the ancient world. And our man Eratosthenes, he wasn't just hanging out in the library stacks. He was the head librarian. Talk about a dream job for a history buff. But here's the thing, being surrounded by all that knowledge, it sparked a question, a curiosity that would lead him to achieve something remarkable. It all started with a simple observation. Okay, picture this. You're in Syene, it's the longest day of the year, the sun is blazing, and boom, you look down a well and there's no shadow, just a perfect beam of sunlight hitting the water at the bottom. Eratosthenes knew that on the summer solstice at noon, the sun shone directly down a well in the city of Syene, which is modern day Aswan. Now, most people would probably just find this curious and move on with their day, but Eratosthenes, he saw something more. Talk about a light bulb moment. He realized that the simple observation held the key to unlocking a much larger mystery, the circumference of the Earth. But how do you go from a shadowless well to measuring the entire planet? That's where Eratosthenes' genius really shines through. He knew that Alexandria, where he was, was located almost directly north of Syene. Like two perfectly placed push pins on a map. Exactly. And that detail was crucial because it meant that the two cities were on nearly the same meridian, a line running north to south on the globe. So he's got Syene with its shadowless well on the summer solstice, and he's got Alexandria, a good chunk north on that same line. This geographical relationship was the foundation of his entire calculation. What's the next step in this ancient world experiment? Well, on that same summer solstice at noon, Eratosthenes set up a simple experiment in Alexandria. He took a gnomon, which is essentially a stick placed upright, and measured the angle of the shadow it cast. So no fancy equipment, just a stick and the sun. It sounds almost too basic, doesn't it? Don't let the simplicity fool you. So it's like geometry class just got real. This was a clever move. You see, the angle of the shadow in Alexandria compared to the no-shadow situation in Syene told Eratosthenes something crucial. It revealed the difference in the sun's angle between the two cities at that exact moment. He's got this angle figured out, but he still needs to know the actual distance between these two cities, right? Like, how far apart are his two push pins on the map? And that's where things get even more interesting. Wait, hold on, stadia. He relied on the measurements taken by bematists, professional surveyors of that era. That's not exactly a unit of measurement we use every day. They had determined that the distance between Alexandria and Syene was approximately 5,000 stadia. You're right. A stadia was an ancient Greek unit of length, roughly equivalent to 600 feet. Of course, there's some debate about the precise length of a stadia as it varied somewhat depending on the time and place. But for Eratosthenes' purposes, this was the most accurate measurement available. All right, so let me get this straight. Eratosthenes knows the angle of the sun in Alexandria thanks to his trusty stick, and he knows the distance to Syene thanks to those meticulous bematists. But how does he go from these two pieces of information to the Earth's circumference? That's the beauty of it. What's the missing link? With these two seemingly simple pieces of information, Eratosthenes had everything he needed to perform a brilliant calculation. And for that, we'll have to delve a bit deeper into the world of ancient geometry and the power of deduction. Okay, so we've got sticks and shadows and ancient surveyors. It's like a giant puzzle where he's found the crucial missing piece. It sounds like the setup to a history riddle. Precisely. But I have a feeling this is where things get mind-blowingly brilliant. He had the angle, the slice of the pizza, he had the distance between the cities, the crust of the slice. Tell me, how did Eratosthenes use all of this to pull off what seems like an impossible measurement? And with a bit of math wizardry, he could calculate the circumference of the entire Earth, the whole delicious pie. That's incredible. He understood a fundamental geometric principle, the relationship between angles, circles, and proportions. Just thinking about the elegance of that solution, using simple geometry to unlock a secret about the entire planet. Remember, Eratosthenes knew the Earth was curved. So after all that calculation, after measuring shadows and pacing out distances, what was the verdict? He also knew that a circle has 360 degrees. How big did Eratosthenes determine the Earth to be? By measuring the angle of the shadow cast by the gnomon in Alexandria, he was essentially measuring a tiny slice of that 360-degree circle, the slice between Alexandria and Syene. Okay, I'm visualizing a pizza here. Exactly. He's got a slice, but he needs to know the size of the whole pie. Eratosthenes realized that the angle he measured, that slice of the Earth between Alexandria and Syene, represented a proportion of the Earth's entire circumference. Okay, let me see if I can follow this. He's comparing the angle he measured, that sliver of the Earth, to the whole circle of the Earth, right? And since he knew the distance between those two cities, thanks to those diligent bematists, he could set up a simple proportion to figure out the whole circumference. You've got it. He's like... He reasoned that the ratio of that small angle to the full circle of 360 degrees was the same as the ratio of the distance between the cities to the Earth's total circumference. He arrived at the astonishingly accurate figure of 252,000 stadia. Hold on, I'm pulling up the actual circumference of the Earth right now. Now, if we convert that to modern units, that's roughly 24,860 miles. Okay, Google tells me it's about 24,860 miles. Okay, Google tells me it's about 24,901 miles. He was only off by a fraction of a percent. Less than 2% error, in fact. And remember, this was achieved with sticks, shadows, and the best estimates of distance available at the time. It's mind-blowing. No satellites, no fancy measuring devices, just pure brainpower and a deep understanding of geometric principles. It really makes you appreciate the ingenuity of these ancient scholars. But it's more than just a cool math trick, right? Absolutely. This wasn't just about getting the right answer. It was about challenging the very way people understood the world. Before Eratosthenes, the prevailing belief among many was that the Earth was flat. His calculation provided one of the first definitive proofs that our planet is, in fact, a sphere. Talk about a paradigm shift. Precisely. So he not only accurately measured the Earth, but also fundamentally changed how people perceived their place in the cosmos. His work was a testament to the power of observation, deduction, and the importance of challenging accepted beliefs. Eratosthenes' legacy extends far beyond a single measurement. It's a shining example of the human thirst for knowledge and our ability to achieve extraordinary things with limited resources. It's inspiring to think about. But here's something that's been rattling around in my brain. We've been talking about Eratosthenes as this brilliant mathematician, surveyor, and astronomer. But he was also the head librarian at the Library of Alexandria, right? You're right, and that's not a coincidence. Eratosthenes was clearly a man of diverse interests, a polymath who excelled in many fields. He wasn't just a numbers guy stuck in a single discipline. Okay, let's unpack this idea a bit more, because it seems like it's about more than just one man's curiosity. So we've got this incredible story of scientific discovery, but it's all happening within the walls of one of the most legendary libraries in history. It makes you wonder what was in the water at the Library of Alexandria. It's almost like they were light years ahead of their time. It's fascinating to consider, isn't it? You had mathematicians rubbing shoulders with poets. The library wasn't just a repository for scrolls. It was a dynamic center of learning. Astronomers comparing notes with philosophers. Scholars from different cultures and disciplines came together there, exchanging ideas, debating theories, inspiring one another. That kind of cross-pollination of ideas must have been incredibly fertile ground for innovation. Absolutely. And Eratosthenes, as the head librarian, was at the epicenter of it all. And Eratosthenes, as the head librarian, was at the epicenter of it all. He wasn't confined to a single department or field of study. He was immersed in a world of knowledge that spanned the known world and encompassed countless disciplines. It makes you think about how we often compartmental
