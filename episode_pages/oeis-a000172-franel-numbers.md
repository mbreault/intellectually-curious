## Transcript

All right, welcome back to the deep dive. You know, if you've been with us for a while now, we've been taking a pretty deep look at the OEIS and some of those entries out there, they just, they really grab your attention. Today, we're going to dive into one of those, Ed A00172, the Franell numbers. Yeah, it's a really great sequence. Anyone out there listening who's seriously following along with us and going deeper into number theory, well, you're going to find a lot to like with Franell numbers. They seem simple enough when you first see them, but wow, there's just so much there. So let's start there then. What exactly are these Franell numbers? How are they defined? Yeah, so they're also sometimes called the third order Franell numbers, just to be specific, and they're defined using a sum. Pretty straightforward at first glance. We write the nth Franell number as A of n, and it's just the sum of the cubes of the binomial coefficients. Cubes of binomial coefficients. Okay, so we're cubing those and then adding them all up. Right, exactly. And the lower index in that sum, that goes from zero up to n. So could we write that out formally? Yeah, so formally we write it as A of n equals, and then we use the summation symbol with k equals zero at the bottom and n at the top of open parenthesis, n choose k, closed parenthesis, all cubed. Okay, so n choose k, all cubed, and then add all those up from k equals zero to n. Exactly. Got it. So what are some of the first few terms of the sequence? Sure, so if we start with n equals zero, the first few terms are 1, 2, 10, 5, 6, 3, 46, 22, 52. It keeps going from there, and the numbers start to get really big pretty fast. The OEIS entry has a lot more terms listed out, but as you can see, they really take off. Yeah, wow, they do get large quickly. So in our deep dive today, what's the big question we're trying to answer about these numbers? What's so special about them? Well, the interesting thing about Franel numbers is they show up in a ton of different areas of math. I mean, the definition is really simple, right? But we find them in combinatorics, number theory, analysis, even geometry. So we're going to take a look at some of these places where they pop up and try to figure out why they're so important to mathematicians. It sounds like we have a pretty interesting journey ahead of us. So we've talked about how they are defined. Let's start in an area where it seems like they have a natural connection, combinatorics. You know, the art of counting and arranging things. The OEIS entry mentioned something called Strael's identity. Strael's identity is really interesting. It gives us another way to write the Franel numbers, and it's kind of surprising when you first see it. It says that A of n, that nth Franel number, it's also equal to the sum from k equals 0 to n of, well, we have a square of a binomial coefficient here, so open parenthesis, n choose k, close parenthesis, squared times another binomial coefficient, open parenthesis, 2k choose n, close parenthesis. Wow, that's pretty interesting. So you're saying that adding up the cubes of the binomial coefficients gives us the same exact sequence as this other sum with squares of binomial coefficients and a different binomial coefficient term. It seems like there has to be some kind of connection between those two, like maybe we can prove that they are the same using a combinatorial argument. Exactly. That's what we often find in combinatorics. When we have two different ways to count something, there's often a deeper meaning behind it. It would be really interesting to find a direct way to connect those two sums, but that's still an open problem. So maybe one of our listeners out there can take a crack at that. Maybe. So sticking with this combinatorics theme, the OEIS entry also mentions a connection to something called Nash equilibria. Yeah, Nash equilibria. So that's a concept from game theory. It turns out that the nth Franel number, A of n, it tells us something about games with three players. Specifically, it gives us the largest possible number of totally mixed Nash equilibria when each of the players has n plus one pure strategies. Okay, now how is that possible? How can a sum of binomial coefficients tell us something about strategies in a game? That seems like we're moving to a totally different area of math now. Well, it turns out that when you're trying to figure out these Nash equilibria, you end up needing to solve systems of polynomial equations, and sometimes figuring out how many real solutions these equations have, well, it involves combinatorial stuff. And in this case, for this specific type of game, the number we end up with is a Franel number. It's pretty amazing, actually, how all these different areas of math connect together. It really is. Now, I also noticed that the OEIS entry mentioned something about directed path enumeration and semi-magic squares. What's that all about? That's a really cool connection, but it's a little bit more specialized. The OEIS entry links to a paper on the Arxiv, which is a preprint server where math and petition share their research. Basically, what's going on is that if you imagine a grid, like a checkerboard, and you try to count certain kinds of paths on that grid, and those paths have something to do with semi-magic squares, which are these special kinds of squares with numbers in them, well, it turns out that the number of those paths can be a Franel number. Okay, so we're really seeing this theme of counting popping up again and again with Franel numbers. We can think of them as counting all sorts of different things, like paths or equilibria. Now, how about actually generating this sequence? The outline mentions something called recurrence relations, which I think are pretty cool, if I remember correctly. Recurrence relations, they are really cool. They give us a way to calculate the next number in the sequence, just using the ones that came before it. So we don't have to use that original sum every single time, which can be a huge time-saver. For the Franel numbers, we have a second-order linear recurrence relation. It says that open parenthesis, n plus 1, close parenthesis squared times A of n plus 1 equals open parenthesis, 7n squared plus 7n plus 2, close parenthesis times A of n plus 8n squared times A of n minus 1. Okay, so that's quite a bit more complicated than just that simple sum, isn't it? How do mathematicians figure out these kinds of relationships? It often involves using tools from different parts of math, things like combinatorial identities, generating functions, or the theory of special functions. And it turns out that this guy, T.W. Cusick, he figured out a really general way to get these recurrence relations, not just for third-order Franel numbers, but for other Franel numbers too. There's actually a whole family of them. A whole family of Franel numbers, wow. Okay, so now let's move over to number theory. I know from the outline that there's a connection between Franel numbers and prime numbers, which seems pretty cool. It is really cool. A mathematician named Z. Wei Sun, he proved this really amazing result that shows how Franel numbers and primes are connected. He showed that for any prime number p, if you take the pth Franel number, so A of p, and you divide it by p cubed, well, the remainder is always 2. Really? Always 2? That's a pretty precise relationship. It is, and it's not at all obvious just by looking at the definition of Franel numbers. The proof uses some really clever ideas from number theory and combinatorics. I remember reading that there's a conjecture out there related to this result, something by Gary Detlefs? Yeah, Detlefs conjectured that the opposite is also true. So if you find a number, call it n, and if the nth Franel number, A of n, has a remainder of 2 when you divide it by n cubed, well, then n has to be a prime number. So basically a way to use Franel numbers to find prime numbers. Exactly. But this is still a conjecture. It hasn't been proven yet. It would be a pretty amazing result if it turns out to be true, though. That would definitely be huge. Yeah. Okay, now moving on, I see in the outline that Franel numbers are sometimes called Apery-like. What does that even mean? Apery-like, yeah. That term is used to describe a bunch of different integer sequences that show up in number theory, especially when you're talking about this thing called the Riemann zeta function. Now, the most famous example of an Apery-like sequence is, well, the Apery sequence. A mathematician named Roger Apery used this sequence to prove that a certain value of the Riemann zeta function, zeta of 3, is irrational. Okay, so kind of like Franel numbers. These Apery-like sequences have some pretty deep connections to number theory. Yeah, exactly. And even though we don't have a strict definition for what it means to be Apery-like, we know that they usually have these linear recurrence relations with polynomial coefficients. And they often have combinatorial interpretations and connections to these things called modular forms. So Franel numbers fit in with all these other important sequences in number theory.
