## Description

We explore the recordâ€‘breaking giant radio galaxy Porphyrionâ€”seven megaparsecs acrossâ€”and the physics of cosmic jets, redshift-space distortions, and how these behemoths sculpt the cosmic web. From LOFAR surveys and the Radio Galaxy Zoo crowdsourcing to a catalog of over 11,000 giants, we unpack what these giants tell us about the early universe and galaxy evolution.

## Transcript

Okay, so get this. Imagine a structure, like created by a black hole, but it stretches across a vast portion of the universe. Wild, right? Well, that's what we're diving into today. Giant radio galaxies. What's fascinating is we're talking about these incredibly powerful jets. Jets of energy and matter blasted out by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies. And get this. Scientists have just discovered a new record breaker. Oh, wow. They've nicknamed it Porphyrion using the LOFAR telescope. And it's not just its size, though it is mind-bogglingly huge. But what it tells us about the early universe, like how these cosmic jets even work. Yeah, Porphyrion is a cosmic titan, no doubt about it. It spans, get this, seven megaparsecs. Seven? But before we get lost in just how huge that is, let's take a step back for a second. How do we even measure these objects across such vast distances? You're talking about redshift space, right? I'm like, hmm, how do I explain this? Imagine trying to hit a moving target, but you're on a platform that's moving too. I see what you mean. The universe itself is expanding and everything is in motion, so. It distorts our observations for sure. Makes it incredibly tough to pinpoint an object's true size and position. Actually, one of the research papers we're looking at today by Korea and their team, they tackled this problem head on. I was just going to ask you about that. They focused on how redshift space affects how we study cosmic voids, basically vast underdense regions in the cosmic web, you know. Like the empty spaces between those galaxies, Thalman. Exactly. They developed this really clever mapping technique, basically connecting what we see in redshift space back to the real universe. So, correcting for the distortion. Precisely. They found that large voids that we identify in, you know, observational data, they almost always have a real space counterpart. So they're not just an illusion caused by redshift. Exactly. They're really out there. But let's get back to these giant radio galaxies. Okay, yes. Seven megaparsecs. Can you, like, put that into perspective? How big is that, really? Okay, so Porphyrion is about 66% of a typical cosmic void's radius at that redshift, of course. Now imagine shrinking Porphyrion down to the size of a human hair. Okay. Okay, I'm imagining it. A typical galaxy would be about the size of a grain of sand. That's the scale we're dealing with here. That's mind-blowing. And you know, it used to be thought that these giant radio galaxies, they were incredibly rare. But there's a new study out by OE and their team, and they completely challenged that assumption. Yeah, they've compiled this incredible catalog. Over 11,000 giant radio galaxies. It completely changes our understanding of how common they are. It does. So how did we miss so many for so long? The answer lies in how these objects were identified. They used a really interesting combination of, well, advanced techniques, you could say. Machine learning, for one, to sift through these massive data sets from telescopes like LOFAR. Right, and LOFAR scans huge portions of the sky, right? Exactly. And they also used citizen scientists. Wait, really? Everyday people were involved in this discovery. They harnessed the power of something called the Radio Galaxy Zoo project. Volunteers, everyday people, helped classify these objects just based on their radio images. That's amazing. It just goes to show you how collaborative science can lead to these groundbreaking discoveries. Absolutely. So back to Porphyrion, our cosmic record breaker. How did they manage to capture such a detailed picture of this thing? It was real teamwork. It wasn't just one telescope. They combined data from LOFAR, the upgraded Giant Metrewave radio telescope, and even optical observations from the Keck Eye telescope. So each telescope provided a different piece of the puzzle. Precisely. And what they found really challenged what we thought we knew about how these giant radio jets work. Because it was active when the universe was much denser. You got it. Scientists thought that in the early universe, these jets would be disrupted by the surrounding environment. But Porphyrion's jets, they remained stable across these incredibly vast distances. So what does this tell us about jet physics? It tells us we still have a lot to learn. There are aspects of jet formation, propagation, and stability that we just haven't fully grasped yet. Porphyrion is making us rethink our models. And these giant radio galaxies, they're not just pretty lights, are they? No, they're not. They play this crucial role in shaping the cosmic web. They're like cosmic architects. A perfect way to put it. They're powerful forces, heating up and pushing matter around. They influence where new galaxies form and even how the cosmic web evolves over, well, billions of years. Owee's team calculated that Porphyrion, just this one giant radio galaxy, released as much energy as entire galaxy cluster mergers. Wow, that's insane. So it's not just a single object. It's changing how we understand the evolution of, well, everything. Exactly. That's the beauty of studying these extreme objects. They push the limits of our knowledge and open up all these new avenues for exploration. And the really exciting part is Porphyrion's discovery hints that there's a whole bunch more of these giants out there, just lurking too faint for us to see right now. A whole universe of hidden giants waiting to be discovered. As our telescopes get more powerful, we're going to be uncovering even larger structures. It's like we're constantly pushing the boundaries of what we thought was even possible in the universe. Which brings us back to Owee's research, right? You mentioned it changes our understanding of giant radio galaxies. Oh, absolutely. So tell me, how did they even find over 11,000 of these giant radio galaxies? Well, they started with this thing called the Lofar 2 Meter Sky Survey, LSS for short. Catchy. Right. It's this ongoing project. Basically, they're mapping the northern sky in crazy detail using these low radio frequencies to pick up these really faint signals from super distant objects like these giant radio galaxies. Okay, so even with a telescope as powerful as Lofar, trying to find these giant radio galaxies must be like, what, finding a needle in a haystack? But like a cosmic haystack. That's a great analogy. And you're right, it is a monumental task. That's where the machine learning comes in. Oh, right. You said they use machine learning. They did. They basically trained this algorithm to recognize the telltale signs of a giant radio galaxy, all within the LSS data. So the algorithm was like a super efficient cosmic detective. Exactly. Scanning through millions of images, searching for the most promising candidates. That's wild. But they didn't rely solely on this algorithm, did they? You're right, they didn't. They wanted to be extra sure. So they combined the machine learning with, get this, citizen science. Wait, really? Yeah. They used a project called Radio Galaxy Zoo. Thousands of volunteers, just regular people looked at these images, helping to classify these objects based on, well, how they looked in the radio images. It's amazing, really. Combining human intuition with cutting-edge technology led to this major breakthrough. That's incredible. I love that people can contribute to these huge discoveries. So this new catalog, it must be a treasure trove of information. What are some of the key things astronomers are learning from it? One of the most surprising, I think, is that giant radio galaxies, well, they might actually be way more common than we originally thought. Really? Yeah. Their results suggest the number of these giants could be comparable to other luminous but smaller radio galaxies. So the idea that giants are rare is being completely challenged. It really is, and that has huge implications for how we think about how galaxies evolve and how these giant radio jets influence their surroundings. Speaking of influence, let's talk about how these giants shape the cosmic web. You call them cosmic architects earlier. Yeah, it's a good analogy. So think of the cosmic web like this giant network, right? Filaments, clusters of galaxies, all interspersed with these giant voids. Most of the universe's matter, it lives in these filaments. Right, right. And they're incredibly dynamic, always changing. And these giant radio jets, they inject energy into these filaments, right? Sort of like shaking things up a bit. That's it, exactly. Imagine these jets just blasting through the intergalactic medium, heating it up, creating shock waves, pushing matter around. Like giant cosmic bulldozers just reshaping the cosmic landscape. Perfect. And this process, it really impacts where new galaxies form, how those galaxy clusters evolve. It's even possible these jets help magnetize the cosmic web, like seeding the magnetic fields we see today. Wow, so they're not just amazing to look at. They're fundamental to how our universe as we know it even came to be. That's the thing they are. Now remember how we talked about cosmic voids? The vast empty spaces. That's, well, always team. They suggested that these giant radio galaxies might be super important to how those voids are shaped. They calculated that Porphyrion, it released as much energy as galaxy cluster mergers. And those are some of the most energetic events in the universe. So these jets, they're powerful enough to influence the evolution of entire cosmic voids. That's incredible. It is. And it gets even more interesting. They proposed that a bunch of these giants, they were around when the universe was a lot smaller. Oh, wow. So back in the early universe, these jets would have had a proportionally larger impact on their
