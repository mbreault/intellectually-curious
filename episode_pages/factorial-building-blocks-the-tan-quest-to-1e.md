## Description

A deep dive into the TAN functionâ€”the largest minimum factor in a factorization of n!. We trace the Erdosâ€“Selfridgeâ€“Strauss conjecture, the mystique of the lost proof, and Terence Taoâ€™s asymptotic bounds showing tn/n â†’ 1/e. Along the way we unravel how primes just above n/e constrain decompositions and what the convergence rate reveals about the hidden structure of factorials.

## Transcript

Welcome back everyone for another deep dive. Today we'll be exploring a rather curious corner of mathematics. Those of you who've dabbled in math probably remember factorials, right? Yes, factorials. You know that concept where you take a number and multiply it by all the positive whole numbers smaller than it? Like five factorials, five times four times three times two times one? Exactly. Five factorial, which we write as five with an exclamation mark equals 120. But here's the twist. We're not just interested in calculating factorials. We're going deeper. We're asking, how can we express a factorial as a product of numbers that are all relatively large? It might seem counterintuitive at first, right? I mean, we usually think of breaking things down into smaller pieces. Exactly. Breaking them down, not building them up from larger chunks. But that's where things get interesting. See, factorials grow so quickly. Exploring the limits of their factors gives us a new perspective on their structure. So it's kind of like looking for the biggest possible building blocks for a factorial? That's a great way to put it. We're trying to find the largest possible building blocks if we want to express n factorial as a product of several integers that are all at least a certain size. Okay, now to make this a little more concrete, mathematicians have come up with a specific function. They call it TAN. And it represents the largest number such that n factorial can be written as a product of integers all greater than or equal to that number, TN. There's even a sequence in the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS. It's A034258. It lists the values of TN for small values of n. I was looking at that sequence earlier, and it's pretty interesting. What struck me was that some numbers are missing, like 36, 49, 52, 55. You don't see them in the sequence at all. What's up with that? It hints at some underlying structure, right? Some hidden constraints on how factorials can be decomposed. So it's not as simple as just picking any large number and seeing if it works. Not at all. Maybe an example would help. Let's take 6 factorial, which is 720. You can factor as 24 times 30. Those are fairly large numbers, right? Yeah, definitely bigger than 1, at least. But T6 isn't 24. It's actually 2. You can write 720 as 2 times 360, and all the factors there are at least 2. So even though you can find a decomposition with larger numbers, the largest possible minimum factor is actually much smaller. Exactly. And if you tried to use a larger minimum factor, say 3, you wouldn't be able to find a decomposition of 720 where all the factors are 3 or greater. That's really interesting. It shows that finding this largest possible minimum factor, it's a bit more nuanced than you might initially think. Precisely. And as n grows larger, n factorial becomes absolutely enormous. Oh yeah. I remember trying to calculate factorials for larger numbers back in school. They blow up really quickly. They do. And we can get a rough estimate of how quickly they grow using something called Stirling's formula. From Stirling's formula, you can actually derive a simple upper bound for tn. An upper bound, meaning tn can't be bigger than this value. Right. It can't be bigger than the nth root of n factorial. Written mathematically, that's n factorial raised to the power of 1 over n. So that gives us a starting point, a sort of ceiling for how large tn can be. Exactly. It's a very crude boundary, though. The real challenge lies in figuring out how close tn can actually get to this upper bound, or more interestingly, to some fraction of n itself. So that's the real heart of the problem, understanding the relationship between tn and n as n grows very large. Precisely. And this leads us to some fascinating mathematical history. Back in the day, mathematicians Paul Ergens, John Selfridge, and Ernst G. Strauss made a bold conjecture. Oh, this is going to be good. I love a good mathematical conjecture. They conjectured that the ratio of tn to n, this tn over n, approaches 1 over e as n becomes very large. 1 over e, for those who don't remember e, is that special mathematical constant roughly equal to 2.718. Right. So 1 over e is approximately 0.3679. So their conjecture was essentially saying that even as factorials get unbelievably huge, the largest possible minimum factor tn maintains a certain proportional relationship with n. That's a pretty remarkable idea when you think about it. This hidden connection between the size of a factorial and the size of its largest minimum factor. And what's even more remarkable is that they apparently had a proof for this conjecture, but it was lost? Ah, yes, the lost proof. It's a bit of a mathematical mystery. A real shame, because their proof likely contained valuable insights into the nature of factorials. So for a long time, this fundamental question about the behavior of tn remained unanswered. Thankfully, more recent work has shed light on this problem. Oh, really? So someone finally picked up the torch and made some progress on this lost conjecture? Yes, mathematician Terence Tao, you might know him. Oh, wow, Terence Tao, a Fields Medalist. That's some serious mathematical firepower. He's done some groundbreaking work in many areas of mathematics. And in this case, he made significant progress on understanding the behavior of tn. So what did Tao discover? Did he manage to prove the Erdos-Selfridge-Strauss conjecture? He didn't prove the conjecture in its original form, but he did something even better. He established asymptotic bounds for the ratio tn over n. Asymptotic bounds? Can you explain what those are? Asymptotic bounds essentially describe how a function behaves as its input grows towards infinity. So in this case, it's telling us how the ratio of tn to n changes as n gets larger and larger. Exactly. And the remarkable thing is that Tao's bounds for tn over n confirm the essence of the Erdos-Selfridge-Strauss conjecture. They tell us that this ratio does indeed approach 1 over e, but they give us much more precise information about how it approaches that value. That's amazing. So even though the original proof was lost, the core idea of the conjecture was correct. It was. And Tao's work gives us a much deeper understanding of why it's correct. So tell me, what are these bounds that Tao found? How close does tn over n get to 1 over e as n goes to infinity? Tao proved both a lower bound and an upper bound. The lower bound says that tn over n is greater than or equal to 1 minus big O of 1 over log n. Okay, hold on. Let's break that down a bit. What's big O of 1 over log n? Big O notation is a way to describe the growth rate of a function. In this case, big O of 1 over log n means that the difference between tn over n and 1 is bounded by some constant times 1 over the natural logarithm of n. So as n gets larger and larger, that difference shrinks at least as fast as some constant divided by log n. Exactly. It means tn over n gets closer and closer to 1 over e from below. The lower bound guarantees that you can always find factors that are a substantial fraction of n, and that fraction gets closer to 1 over e as n increases. So the lower bound tells us we can get pretty close to 1 over e. What about the upper bound? Does it also approach 1 over e? The upper bound is even more interesting. It says that tn over n is less than 1 minus c0 plus little o of 1 all divided by log n. Okay, another piece of notation to unpack. What's c0 and what's little o of 1? c0 is a specific constant, approximately equal to 0.3044. And little o of 1 represents a quantity that goes to 0 as n becomes infinitely large. So the upper bound tells us that tn over n also approaches 1 over e as n grows, but it does so from below. Exactly. And the gap between tn over n and 1 over e is not arbitrary. It's tied to this constant c0 and the logarithm of n. This gives you a much finer picture than just knowing the limiting value. It tells you something about the rate of convergence, how quickly tn over n approaches 1 over e. It's like having a speedometer for the convergence. It not only tells you where you're going, but also how fast you're getting there. That's a great analogy. And this refined our understanding of how tn behaves for a very large n is a major contribution of Tao's work. Now I'm curious about the why. Why can't tn over n get arbitrarily close to 1 over e? What's preventing it from crossing that threshold? The key insight lies in understanding the role of prime numbers. Specifically, the primes that are slightly larger than n over e. Prime numbers always seem to sneak their way into these kinds of problems, don't they? They do. They're the building blocks of all integers after all. Now think about this. Any way you break down n factorial into factors must include these prime factors just above n over e in one of those factors. Because every prime number up to n is a factor of n factorial. Right. So if a prime number p is just a little bit bigger than n over e, then any multiple of p that's at least as large as tn will have to be at least p itself. This puts a constraint on how small the other factors in your decomposition can be. Hmm. Let me see if I understand this
