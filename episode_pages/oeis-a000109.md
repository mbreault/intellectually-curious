## Transcript

Welcome back to our deep dive into the OEIS. That amazing online encyclopedia of integer sequences. It's a treasure trove. It really is. For any number theory enthusiast. And that's who we're really focusing on today. Absolutely. With a sequence that's going to be particularly relevant for you number theory folks out there. It bridges the gap between number theory and some really cool geometry and graph theory concepts. So we're talking A000109 today. We are! Okay, so let's start with the basics. A000109 begins with 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 14. And just keeps growing rapidly. It takes off. Right away. That gives us a clue that something complex is going on. For sure. What exactly is this sequence counting? Well, it's counting simplicial polyhedra. Okay. Think of them as 3D shapes. Okay. Where every face is a triangle. So like pyramids. Like pyramids, exactly. But they can get a lot more intricate. Oh yeah, they can get much more complex. I'm intrigued. But how does that tie back to number theory? Here's where the connection to graph theory comes in. This sequence also counts a very specific type of graph. Simple planar graphs with n vertices and 3 and 6 edges. I see. So imagine drawing a network of points and lines on a flat surface without any lines crossing. That's a planar graph. Okay. Simple just means no loops. Got it. Or double lines between the same points. Okay. And that 3 and 6 part is key. Okay. It makes these graphs maximal, meaning you can't add more lines without them crossing. I see. So the number of these special graphs with n points is the same as the number of simplicial polyhedra with n vertices. That's exactly it. That's pretty cool. And there's even more to this connection. Okay. The OEIS entry mentions that every planar triangulation with at least 4 vertices, which is a way to divide a shape into triangles, has a corresponding 3-connected cubic planar graph. Can we unpack that a bit? Sure. What exactly does 3-connected mean in this context? It means that you would need to remove at least 3 lines from the graph to break it into separate pieces. Think of it as a measure of how strongly connected the graph is. And cubic means that every point in the graph has exactly 3 lines connected to it. So we're talking about really well-connected networks here. Exactly. Wow. And the fact that these 3-connected cubic planar graphs have this direct relationship with planar triangulations and simplicial polyhedra highlights the deep connections between these different mathematical concepts. It's really remarkable how it all ties together. It's amazing how these seemingly different areas of math intertwine. The OEIS entry even mentions some heavy hitters in geometry and graph theory like Grunbaum and Toot, who have worked on this sequence. Yeah, their work has been foundational in this area. And it looks like there's even a reference about architectural applications. I saw it. Imagine using the math of simplicial polyhedra to design buildings. That's pretty cool. It's wild. The applications go beyond architecture, though. There are connections to chemistry, computer science, even physics. It's really a testament to how a seemingly abstract sequence can have such far-reaching implications. It speaks to the power of mathematics. That's what makes the OEIS so cool. Absolutely. Okay, so we've got this sequence that counts these intricate shapes and graphs. Right. But how do we actually calculate the terms? That's the million-dollar question. Is there a formula? Well, that's where things get even more interesting. Okay. The OEIS entry provides us with some clues in the formulas section. All right. We don't have an exact formula for every term, which is often the case with sequences that grow this rapidly. Right. But we do have lower bounds and an asymptotic formula. Okay, for our number theory students listening, could you break down what those mean and why they're important? Sure. So lower bounds give us an idea of the minimum value for each term in the sequence. Okay. It tells us that the sequence grows at least this fast. And the asymptotic formula describes how the sequence behaves in the long run. It tells us the sequence grows roughly proportional to 2,627n2 divided by some factors involving n as n gets very large. So even if we don't have a perfect formula, we can still get a sense of how this sequence behaves as it grows. Exactly. And for number theorists, that connection to asymptotic behavior and automorphism groups, which basically describe the symmetry of the graphs, is really valuable. Really valuable insight there. That makes sense. Yeah. And speaking of clues, let's look at the keywords section. Okay. We've got non, which I assume means the terms are non-negative. It does. Makes sense. You can't have a negative number of polyhedra. Right. You can't have negative shapes. But there's also the keyword hard. Ah. What does that tell us? Hard indicates that calculating the terms of this sequence is computationally challenging. It's not something you can easily do with pen and paper as n increases. Right. It gets very complex. So how do we even know what the later terms in the sequence are? That's where sophisticated algorithms, computer programs, come in. Okay. The OEIS entry mentions a program called PlanTree. PlanTree. Yeah. Have you heard of it? I have now. It's a powerful tool. Ah, PlanTree. I'm guessing that's the key to unlocking more of this sequence. It is. Okay. PlanTree uses clever algorithms to generate these specific types of planar graphs. I see. Which, as we've discussed, are directly related to simplicial polyhedra. Okay. This allows mathematicians and computer scientists to extend the sequence far beyond what we could calculate by hand. That's pretty remarkable. We've covered a lot of ground in this first part of our deep dive into A000109. We have. We've gone from counting shapes to exploring complex graphs and even touched on some pretty advanced mathematical concepts. It's a lot to take in. It is. But it's all connected. It is. And that's the beauty of it. Exactly. But we'll be back in the next part. Okay, sounds good. To explore even more facets of A000109. I'm looking forward to it. You know, it's fascinating how this one sequence, A000109, acts as a bridge between these different mathematical worlds. It does. We've got geometry with the polyhedra. Yeah. Combinatorics with the graph theory. And, of course, the number theory underpinning it all. It really highlights how interconnected math is, doesn't it? It does. It's not just isolated branches. No. But a web of relationships. A web. Exactly. And understanding these connections can lead to some pretty surprising applications. I bet. For instance, remember those planar triangulations we talked about? Oh, yeah. They're not just theoretical curiosities. The way we can divide a shape into triangles. Right. What kind of real-world applications do those have? Well, they're used in computer graphics to create 3D models and render images. Oh, wow. Imagine you're designing a video game or a special effect for a movie. Okay. To make those 3D objects look realistic, you need to break them down into smaller, simpler shapes. And triangles are often the most efficient way to do that. So the math we're discussing is literally helping to create the visual world we see on screen. It is. It's incredible. And the applications go even further. Oh, wow. Okay. Remember that reference to chemistry in the OEIS entry? Oh, yeah. It turns out that the structure of certain molecules, like fullerenes. Fullerenes. Yeah. Remind me what those are. They're molecules made entirely of carbon atoms arranged in these beautiful symmetrical structures that resemble geodesic domes. Hmm. Think of a soccer ball. Okay. That's a classic example of a fullerene structure. I see. And the way those carbon atoms are connected can be represented by these planar graphs we've been talking about. Precisely. By understanding the properties of these graphs, chemists can gain insights into the stability, reactivity, and other characteristics of these molecules. Wow. So we've gone from counting shapes to video games to chemistry. We have. All thanks to this one sequence. It's amazing how these connections ripple outwards. It really is. And remember, we've only just scratched the surface of A000109. Right. Calculating the terms of this sequence gets really tricky very quickly, even with computers. Right. That hard keyword really stood out. It's a tough one. Yeah. But we did mention that program PlanTree. We did. Can you tell us a bit more about how that works and why it's so important for studying this sequence? Sure. PlanTree is a fantastic tool that allows mathematicians to generate these specific types of planar graphs we've been talking about. Okay. It does this by cleverly exploring all the possible ways you can connect vertices with edges while maintaining the planarity and other properties we've discussed. So it's like a systematic search through all the potential graphs that fit the criteria for A000109. Exactly. And it's incredibly efficient. Wow. PlanTree allows us to extend the sequence far beyond what we could calculate by hand or even with less sophisticated computer programs. It makes you wonder how many terms of this sequence we could compute if we had even more powerful algorithms and computers. It's an exciting thought. It is. And it highlights the ongoing challenge and excitement in this field. Yeah. As technology advances, we can push the boundaries of what we know about these fascinating sequences. Who knows what new discoveries and connections await us. This whole discussion has really sparked my curiosity. I'm starting to see these integer sequences in a whole new light. I'm glad to hear that. They're not just lists of
