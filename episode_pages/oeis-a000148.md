## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone, to another deep dive into the OEIS. Yes. Today, we're going to be tackling a sequence that, well, it puts a unique twist on something that we've been talking about quite a bit, which is integer partitions. Yeah, that's right. We're going to be going beyond just those neat whole numbers and looking at partitions into non-integral powers, so specifically OEIS sequence A000148. Okay, I have to admit, when I hear the phrase non-integral powers, it sounds a little bit intimidating. Yeah. Can you break it down for me a little bit? What exactly does that mean? Sure. So usually when we talk about powers, we're dealing with whole number exponents, like 2 squared or 5 cubed. Right. But non-integral powers involve exponents that are fractions or decimals. So instead of like 2 to the power of 3, it might be 2 to the power of 2 thirds or something like that. Exactly. And these fractional exponents have interesting applications. For instance, remember the binomial theorem? Yeah. It helps us expand expressions like x plus y raised to a power. Well, it turns out that the binomial theorem can be generalized to work with non-integral powers as well. Wow. Yeah. So that opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Exactly. But how do these non-integral powers connect to the idea of partitions? Well, that's where sequence A000148 comes in. Okay. This sequence is all about counting the solutions to a particular inequality involving fractional exponents. Okay. So how does this inequality work? So imagine you have an inequality that looks like this. x1 to the 2 thirds plus x2 to the 2 thirds is less than or equal to n, where x1 and x2 are integers and x1 is less than or equal to x2. Okay. The nth term of A000148, denoted as A of n, tells you how many pairs of integers satisfy this inequality for a given value of n. So let me see if I'm following this correctly. Sure. If n is, say, 3, to find its 3, we would need to find all the pairs of integers where 1 is less than or equal to x, which is less than or equal to x2, and the sum of their 2 thirds powers is less than or equal to 3. You got it. Okay. So we're not adding the integers themselves like we would in a normal partition. Right. We're adding their 2 thirds powers. That's right. Okay. That's really interesting. So before we get too far into A000148, maybe we should do a quick recap on integer partitions, just for people who might need a refresher. Sure. So at its core, an integer partition is simply a way of expressing a non-negative integer as a sum of positive integers. Right. For instance, number 4 has 5 partitions, 4, 3 plus 1, 2 plus 2, 2 plus 1 plus 1, and 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1. Yeah, and we can even represent those visually, can't we, using things like Ferrer's diagrams. Exactly, where each row of dots represents a part of the partition. Right. So we're taking this familiar idea of breaking down integers into sums and applying it to this world of non-integral powers. Yes. Which makes A000148 so interesting. Exactly. And there's a lot more to explore there as well. I bet this is already blowing my mind if we've only just started. Yeah. So now that we've kind of got a good grasp on the definition of A000148, what about the actual numbers in the sequence? Yeah, so according to the OEIS entry, the first few terms are 1, 2, 7, 15, 28, 45, 70. Okay. It's clearly growing, but not in a simple, predictable way. Yeah. Like a linear sequence or something. Right, and that's where things start to get really interesting. Unlike some sequences where you can easily find a formula to generate the terms, A000148 is a bit more elusive. In fact, even finding a closed-form expression for the partition function for just standard integer partitions is a famously unsolved problem in mathematics. Wow, so we're dealing with something that really doesn't reveal its secrets easily here. Yeah. It's kind of like we're explorers venturing into, like, uncharted territory. Exactly. So looking at the first few terms, I'm not seeing an obvious pattern jumping out at me. Are there other tools that mathematicians use to tackle sequences like this? Yeah, so that's where things like asymptotic analysis and generating functions come into play. Asymptotic analysis helps us understand how a sequence behaves as the index goes to infinity. So it's kind of like zooming out to get a bird's-eye view of the sequence's overall trajectory. Okay, so instead of getting bogged down in the individual numbers, we're trying to see, like, the bigger picture of how it grows over time. Exactly. Okay. And generating functions are another powerful tool. They provide a way to encode the entire sequence into a single function, which can then be manipulated and analyzed to reveal hidden patterns and relationships. Yeah, we've talked about generating functions before on this show, haven't we? And how incredibly useful they can be for understanding these sequences. It's almost like a secret decoder ring or something like that. Right. That helps you unlock the sequence's hidden message. Exactly. Do we know anything about the generating function for A000148? Unfortunately, our sources don't explicitly provide that. Okay. It's possible that it's out there in the vast sea of mathematical literature. Right. But it seems like it might be an open question. So there's still a lot of mystery surrounding this sequence. But I'm starting to appreciate just how deep and complex it really is. Right. And remember we mentioned earlier that there's some Mathematica code available that can calculate terms of this sequence. Oh, that's right. So even without a neat formula, we can use computational tools to kind of explore its behavior and search for patterns. That's fascinating. So it's like we have a powerful lens that allows us to see further into the sequence than we could with just our own calculations. Yeah. It makes me wonder what kind of patterns might emerge as we compute more and more terms. That's a great question, and it's one that mathematicians are still actively investigating. Yeah. Remember, the OEIS isn't just a static collection of sequences. It's a living, breathing entity that's constantly being updated and expanded as researchers uncover new insights. It's like a collaborative treasure hunt with mathematicians from around the world all contributing to our collective understanding of these sequences. Exactly. I love that. Yeah, me too. And speaking of exploration, we mentioned earlier a research paper by Agarwala and Alluk. Yeah. That might be of interest to our listeners. Yes. It delves into the connection between number theory and statistical mechanics. That's right. I mean, statistical mechanics, isn't that the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of large systems of particles? Yeah. Like gases and liquids? Yes. What does that have to do with number theory? You'd be surprised. It turns out that the tools and concepts from statistical mechanics can be applied to problems in number theory, including understanding partitions. Wow. That's incredible. It's like using a telescope to study microscopic organisms. Yeah. Borrowing tools from one field to illuminate another. Precisely. And in their paper, Statistical Mechanics and Partitions into Non-Integral Powers of Integers, Agarwala and Alluk use these statistical mechanics techniques to explore partitions into non-integral powers, which is directly relevant to our discussion of A000148. So for those listeners who really want to go down the rabbit hole and delve into the deeper theoretical aspects of this topic, this paper provides a more rigorous and in-depth treatment. Yeah. It's like the bonus level for the truly dedicated number theory enthusiasts out there. Absolutely. And even if you don't feel ready to tackle a paper like that just yet, it's still amazing to know that these connections exist. Yeah. And that researchers are actively exploring them. Absolutely. It really highlights that interconnectedness of knowledge and how seemingly disparate fields can actually illuminate and enrich each other. Yeah. But you know, as fascinating as all this theoretical discussion is, I'm also kind of curious about, like, the practical side of things. Are there any, like, real-world applications of non-integral powers? Yeah, that's a great question. So remember when we talked about the binomial theorem being generalized to handle non-integral powers? Yes. That has implications in areas like probability and statistics. You might need to calculate the probability of a certain number of successes in a series of trials. So non-integral powers can help us model and analyze situations where the outcomes aren't always clear-cut or easily predictable. Exactly. And they also pop up in fields like finance, where you might use fractional exponents to calculate compound interest or model the growth of investments over time. Wow. So these seemingly abstract mathematical concepts actually have tangible applications in the real world. Yeah. I love how this deep dive into A000148 has opened up so many new avenues of exploration. Me too. And that's the beauty of the OEIS. It's not just a list of numbers. Right. It's a gateway to a vast and interconnected universe of mathematical ideas. I think we've covered a lot of ground today in our exploration of A000148. We've discussed its definition, its connection to other sequences, the challenges of finding a formula for its terms, and the potential insights that techniques like asymptotic analysis and generating functions could provide. We even touched on its connection to statistical mechanics and its real-world applications. Yeah, it's been quite a journey. It really has. And I think it highlights how much there still is to discover about even seemingly simple mathematical objects like
