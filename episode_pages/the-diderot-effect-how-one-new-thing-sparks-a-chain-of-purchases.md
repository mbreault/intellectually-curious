## Transcript

Okay, so have you ever noticed this thing where, like, you get something new? You know, it could be anything, like a new phone or a pair of shoes. And then you kind of look around, and suddenly everything else seems old. Yes. That's the sneaky thing about consumption. Sometimes one new possession can trigger, like, a whole chain reaction of purchases, like a domino effect. Yeah. And there's a name for it. Okay. It's called the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect. It's named after 19th century French philosopher Denis Diderot. 18th century. All right, now you've really got my attention. Oh, this one is a classic. Yeah. So picture this. It's 1769. Okay. Diderot, a leading Enlightenment thinker, known for his simple lifestyle. Right. He receives a gift. Okay. It's a luxurious scarlet dressing gown. Imagine, like, rich, probably velvet fabric. Oh, wow. A real statement piece. I can already see him, like, swanning around in his luxurious robe. Yeah. Initially, he's absolutely delighted. But then something happens. He starts to feel like his old possessions just don't measure up to the elegance of his new robe. Oh, I see. His straw chair seems too rustic. Okay. His desk too drab. Yeah. Even his artwork starts to feel out of place. So it's almost like this robe created, like, an identity crisis. His belongings. Diderot himself described this feeling as a sense of dissonance. A need for his surroundings to match the perceived status of the robe. I see. So what does he do? What does he do? He ends up replacing his furniture. Wow. His desk. Oh, my God. Even his beloved prints. No way. This, my friend, is the Diderot Effect in action. So he goes on a full-blown shopping spree all because of one fancy robe. It happened. So is this Diderot Effect basically just about vanity then? It's deeper than that. It's not just about wanting to look good. It's about a desire for consistency. Okay. For a sense of completeness or harmony among our possessions. I see. Think about it. How many times have you bought something new and then felt the need to get other things to go with it? Oh, all the time. Like, if I get a new dress, I suddenly feel like I need new shoes and a matching bag. Right. It's like my brain is trying to create a little outfit universe. And that, my friend, is a perfect example of what we call Diderot Unities. Diderot Unities. These are groups of items that we perceive as belonging together. Oh. And you know who else understands these Diderot Unities really well? Who? Marketers and advertisers. Oh, okay. So let's talk about that. Sure. Because you know they're not just passively observing this phenomenon. Right. They're actively leveraging it. Okay. Think about furniture sets designed to be bought together. Right. The must-have accessories for your new car or how tech companies create entire ecosystems of products. You buy a new phone and suddenly you need the latest case, wireless charger, headphones. It's all very strategically designed. So they're basically creating these Diderot Unities for us. Right. Playing into our desire for things to feel complete. Yeah. Or matching. And what's really interesting is that these Diderot Unities, they aren't fixed. Even our own personal preferences. I see. What might be a complete set for one person could be totally different for someone else. That's true. Which brings us to a crucial question. Okay. What does this 18th century philosopher have to do with us in the 21st century? Good question. Especially in a world where we're bombarded with targeted ads and social media influencers telling us what to buy. Okay, yeah. Diderot didn't exactly have to deal with Instagram ads. Right. So how does this effect play out in our modern world? Well, think about it. We're constantly exposed to curated images of ideal lifestyles. And there's immense pressure to keep up with the latest trends. That's true. Is it any wonder that the Diderot effect is arguably even more powerful today? That's a scary thought. Like Diderot on steroids. And I'm guessing this constant pressure to upgrade and match and compete can't be good for our wallets. Or the planet, for that matter. You're hitting on something really important. Like this constant cycle of upgrading and acquiring can have serious downsides. It can. Financial strain, clutter, and of course environmental impact of all this consumption. And it's not just about the physical stuff either. Oh. The Diderot effect can also like seep into other areas of our lives, like our experiences. I see. Even our relationships. Oh, wow. Okay, like how so? Think about it. You start a new hobby. Okay. Let's say photography. And suddenly you feel the need to buy all the latest equipment. Yeah. Even though you could probably enjoy it just as much with a simpler camera. Yeah, that's true. Or maybe you meet someone new and you start feeling pressure to change your style or interests. Yeah. To better fit in with their social circle. Wow, I never thought about it that way. It's almost like the Diderot effect can create this ripple effect that extends beyond just our material possessions. It's like in our heads. Recognizing this is the first step towards like taking back control. Okay. Because here's the good news. Yeah. Once you understand this effect, you can start making more intentional choices. Okay. It's about curating your own Diderot unities. So you're saying. If you will. Okay. Based on your own values and needs, not what advertisers or influencers are telling you to buy. So it's not about rejecting new things altogether, but being more mindful of the ripple effects of our choices. Precisely. It's about asking yourself. Yeah. Is this purchase going to spark a chain reaction of spending? Yeah. Or am I truly content with what I already have? Sometimes simply rediscovering a forgotten item or repurposing something you already own can be more satisfying than buying something brand new. Yeah. I love that. It's about shifting our mindset from one of constant acquisition to one of appreciation for what we already have. And there's actually a psychological concept that ties into this. Okay. It's called the endowment effect. The endowment effect. Studies have shown that people tend to value things they own more highly than things they don't. Which even if the items are objectively the same. That makes sense. Like I've definitely hung on to things for way too long just because they were mine. But okay, let's get practical. How can we actually break this cycle? Sure. You mentioned being more mindful. Yeah. But are there any like concrete steps we can take? Absolutely. One helpful strategy is to think about the long-term consequences of a purchase. Before you buy something, ask yourself, will I still be using this a year from now? Will this item add value to my life in the long run? Or is it just going to end up cluttering my home? So it's about looking beyond that initial excitement of a new purchase and really considering the long-term impact. Right. And it's also about being aware of the tactics marketers use to play on the Diderot effect. Okay. So like what? For example, they often use something called anchoring. Anchoring. Which is a psychological bias where we tend to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive. Okay. So if you see a ridiculously expensive item first, even if you don't buy it, everything else suddenly seems more reasonable in comparison. That's so sneaky. It's like they're setting a high bar. They are. On purpose. Yeah. So everything else looks like a bargain. Exactly. So knowing about these tactics can help you make more informed decisions. Okay. Another practical tip is to create a waiting list. A waiting list. For purchases. If you see something you want, don't buy it right away. Right. Write it down and wait like a week or two. Okay. If you're still thinking about it after that time, and you've carefully considered whether you really need it, then you can make a more deliberate decision. I love that idea. It's like giving yourself a cooling off period to avoid those impulse purchases. And remember, breaking free from the Diderot effect isn't about deprivation. Yeah. It's about finding satisfaction and contentment in what you already have. Right. Making mindful choices that align with your values and focusing on experiences and relationships that bring you true joy. So it's not about demonizing consumption altogether, but rather about being more conscious and intentional about our choices. Precisely. And recognizing that true fulfillment doesn't come from the endless pursuit of more, but from cultivating a sense of contentment and gratitude for what we already have. Beautifully said. Now, before to wrap things up, I want to pose a question to you, dear listener. Think about your own Diderot unities. Are there areas in your life where you've gotten caught up in that cycle of upgrading and completing? Yeah. And more importantly, is there something you already own, something you've maybe forgotten about, that could bring you just as much joy, if not more, than any new purchase? That's such a great point. Sometimes the simplest things can have like the biggest impact. Right. Maybe it's rearranging your furniture to create a fresh perspective. Yeah. Or finally framing those travel photos that have been sitting in a box for years. It could even be as simple as dusting off that old guitar in the corner and rediscovering the joy of playing music. I love that. It's about looking at what we already have with fresh eyes and finding the beauty and value in those things. And, you know, the
