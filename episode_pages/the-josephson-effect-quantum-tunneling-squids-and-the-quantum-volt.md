## Transcript

Welcome back to Science Corner. Yeah. You know, as always, we love to take these really fascinating scientific concepts and break them down for all of you intellectually curious folks out there. Absolutely. And today we are diving deep into something that sounds like something straight out of science fiction. It's called the Josephson Effect, but trust me, this is a very real phenomenon. Oh, yeah. And it has led to some pretty incredible advancements in technology. It has. And it all stems from this like interplay between superconductivity and quantum mechanics. That's right. It's really amazing. And to help us navigate this intricate world, we have a leading expert in the field with us today. I'm happy to be here. Welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. I'm always excited to talk about the Josephson Effect. Me too. Me too. And we're going to be mainly using the Wikipedia article on the Josephson Effect as our main source for this deep dive. Sounds good. So to kind of set the stage for our listeners, imagine we have two superconductors, materials that can conduct electricity with zero resistance. And they're separated by this really tiny, tiny barrier. Okay. Now what happens next is where things get really interesting. It does get interesting. So can you walk us through like what is the Josephson Effect and how does it actually work? Sure. So the Josephson Effect describes how a current made up of these special electron pairs, they're called Cooper pairs, can flow through that barrier between the two superconductors, even without any voltage pushing it along. Wow. Yeah. It's as if the Cooper pairs are tunneling right through the barrier. It's a purely quantum phenomenon. So we've got superconductivity. We've got quantum tunneling. Yeah. That's already a lot to wrap our heads around. It is. Can you expand a bit on that quantum tunneling aspect? Like what is actually happening there? Well, in the world of quantum mechanics, particles can behave like waves. Okay. And just like a wave can kind of spread out and pass through a narrow opening, a particle's wave function can extend beyond a barrier, even if the particle doesn't have enough energy to overcome it classically. So in a Josephson junction, the Cooper pairs' wave functions overlap in the barrier region, allowing them to essentially tunnel through and maintain that supercurrent. That's incredible. And what's even more fascinating is that this isn't just some theoretical concept. Right. The Josephson Effect has real-world applications. Exactly. One of the most well-known applications is in squids. Squids? Or superconducting quantum interference devices. These devices are incredibly sensitive to magnetic fields. They're thousands of times more sensitive than conventional magnetometers. Wow. So how does the Josephson Effect play into that sensitivity? So squids use Josephson junctions in a loop configuration. Okay. And when a magnetic field passes through the loop, it creates a change in the supercurrent flowing through the junctions. By measuring this tiny change in current, we can detect incredibly weak magnetic fields. That's remarkable. And I'm guessing this sensitivity has led to some pretty impactful applications. Oh, absolutely. Squids are used in a wide range of fields from medical imaging, where they can detect tiny magnetic fields produced by brain activity, to geology, where they help map subterranean structures, to material science, where they can analyze the magnetic properties of materials at an extremely fine scale. It's amazing to think that something that relies on these quantum phenomena we can't see directly can have such tangible effects on so many different areas of science and technology. It really is. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Wow. The Josephson Effect also has a fascinating history full of initial skepticism, groundbreaking experiments, and eventually widespread acceptance and application. That's actually something I wanted to touch upon. I read that Brian Josephson, who predicted this effect, was only 23 years old at the time. That's right. He was a graduate student when he made this groundbreaking prediction in 1962, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics just a few years later. It's incredible to think that someone so young could make such a significant contribution to science. I know, it's amazing. But as you mentioned, his theory wasn't immediately embraced by everyone, right? Yeah. Even John Bardeen, a renowned physicist who had already won a Nobel Prize for his work on the theory of superconductivity, initially doubted Josephson's predictions. Wow. It took a few years and further experimental confirmation for the scientific community to fully accept this revolutionary idea. It's a good reminder that even in science, new ideas, especially revolutionary ones, can face resistance. Absolutely. It often takes time, rigorous experimentation, open-mindedness for those paradigm-shifting concepts to become mainstream. Yeah, you're absolutely right. So we've talked about these amazing squids and the history behind the effect. I'm curious to learn more about the different types of Josephson junctions. Sure. What are these weak links that separate the superconductors made of? So there are actually three main types of Josephson junctions, each with its own unique characteristics. Okay. SIS, SNS, and SCS junctions. Okay, let's unpack those acronyms. What do those letters stand for? Sure. So S stands for superconductor, I for insulator, N for normal metal, and C for constriction. Gotcha. So an SIS junction has a thin insulating layer sandwiched between two superconductors. Okay. While an SNS junction uses a normal metal as the link. Makes sense. And in an SCS type, there's actually a physical narrowing or constriction in the superconducting material itself, creating that weak link. And how do these different junction types affect their properties and applications? Well, the type of weak link influences the junction's critical current, which is the maximum supercurrent it can carry. For instance, SIS junctions tend to have lower critical currents compared to SNS junctions. This in turn affects their sensitivity and the types of applications they're best suited for. It sounds like there's a lot of fine tuning involved in designing these junctions to achieve specific performance characteristics. Exactly. Choosing the right materials and fabrication techniques is crucial. Right. For example, in SIS junctions, aluminum oxide is often used as the insulator, while niobium is a common choice for the superconductors. But researchers are constantly exploring new materials and combinations to improve performance and tailor the junctions for specific applications. So it's not just about understanding the theory behind the Josephson effect. It's also about mastering the art of creating these intricate junctions with the right materials and structures. Right. It's this fascinating intersection of fundamental physics and precision engineering. Absolutely. And what's even more remarkable is how, despite relying on these delicate quantum phenomena, the applications of the Josephson effect extend far beyond those highly sensitive squids we discussed earlier. Oh, wow. It even plays a crucial role in defining a fundamental unit of measurement, the volt. Wait, really? How does the Josephson effect tie into defining the volt? That's a bit mind-boggling. It has to do with something called the AC Josephson effect. Okay. When you apply a constant voltage across a Josephson junction, it generates an alternating supercurrent. Okay. And the frequency of this oscillation is precisely proportional to the applied voltage. Okay, so we've got this perfect relationship between voltage and frequency. How does that translate into defining the volt? Because that relationship is so precise and predictable, we can use it to create a device called a Josephson voltage standard. By applying a known, highly stable frequency to a Josephson junction, we can generate an extremely accurate and stable voltage. Wow. This allows us to define the volt in terms of fundamental physical constants, rather than relying on less stable physical artifacts. So essentially, the Josephson effect provides a quantum mechanical basis for the volt. That's right. Linking a fundamental unit of measurement to those mind-boggling quantum phenomena we've been discussing. Exactly. It highlights how understanding these seemingly abstract concepts in quantum mechanics can have a profound impact on our ability to make precise measurements in the macroscopic world. It's a beautiful example of how fundamental physics research can lead to unexpected but incredibly practical outcomes. It's like uncovering a hidden connection between the vast universe and our everyday lives. And there's still so much more to explore about the Josephson effect, its unique properties, its wide range of applications, and its potential to revolutionize technology in the future. I completely agree. We've only scratched the surface today, and there are many more fascinating aspects of the Josephson effect to delve into. Well, let's delve in. Let's keep going. You mentioned that we've only scratched the surface. I'm curious about this concept I came across while I was prepping for this deep dive. It's called Josephson inductance. Oh, yeah. Is that anything like the inductance that we see in coils? That's a great question. It does show behavior similar to inductance in a coil, but the underlying mechanism is completely different. So in a coil, inductance arises from the magnetic field generated by the current flowing through it. Right. But with Josephson inductance, it's all about the kinetic energy of those Cooper pairs. Okay. You know, those paired electrons that are responsible for superconductivity. Yeah. So instead of magnetic fields, it's the motion of those Cooper pairs that creates this inductance. Okay. So could you give us like a concrete example of how Josephson inductance might be used? Certainly one area where Josephson inductance plays a crucial role is in superconducting circuits. Okay. These circuits are designed to operate at extremely low temperatures where resistance essentially vanishes. Right, right. And because of Josephson inductance, these circuits can exhibit unique and valuable properties like being able to store energy in a very compact space or switching between different states extremely quickly. So it sounds like Josephson inductance opens up a whole new world of possibilities in circuit design, especially when working with superconductors. Exactly. And as we delve deeper into the quantum realm,
