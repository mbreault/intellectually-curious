## Description

Join us as we chase astatine, the rarest halogen that almost vanished from Earth. Weâ€™ll trace its century-long huntâ€”from Mendeleevâ€™s eka-iodine prediction to its lab-made birth in cyclotronsâ€”and explore its unusual properties, including hints of metallic behavior and even superconductivity. Most of all, we dive into targeted alpha therapy using astatine-211: how it can seek out cancer cells with precision, the delivery and stability hurdles, and the production bottlenecks scientists are racing to overcome.

## Transcript

Okay, so get this, we're diving deep into astatine today. Astatine. You know that element that's so rare it basically doesn't even exist. Right. We've got research here saying that there's like barely a handful of this stuff on the entire planet at any given time. Less than 30 grams. Oh, wow. To be precise. Talk about elusive. Yeah. Astatine makes a ghost look common. Seriously. But here's the kicker. Yeah. This ghostly element might hold the key to like revolutionizing how we treat cancer. Absolutely. So we've got a pile of fascinating research to unpack here. Yeah, it's really a head scratcher. Astatine is a halogen. Okay. Like the chlorine in your pool or the iodine in your salt. Okay. But it also kind of flirts with being a metal or maybe something in between. Interesting. And it's so radioactive that a visible chunk would, well, vaporize itself from the heat of its own decay. Wait, it would just disappear. Like, oof, gone. Okay, now that's a science experiment I want to see from a very safe distance. Right. But back up a second. How do you even begin to search for an element that basically doesn't exist? You start with a prediction. Okay. Back in 1869, Dmitry Mendeleev. Mendeleev. The mastermind behind the periodic table predicted astatine's existence. Wow. He even gave it a placeholder name. Yeah. Eka iodine. Eka iodine. Meaning one spot below iodine on the table. Okay, so scientists knew it should be out there, they just couldn't find it. Exactly. And for decades, they kept coming up empty. Really? There were a few false alarms in the early 1900s. Oh. Where researchers thought they had isolated astatine. Interesting. They even gave it names like alabaman and dakin. Wow. But turns out they were just misidentified elements. So a classic case of mistaken identity in the world of elements. Right. It sounds like a pretty intense scientific treasure hunt. It really was. But eventually someone must hit the jackpot, right? Yes. In 1940. Okay. A team at UC Berkeley. Uh-huh. Corson, McKenzie, and Seagre. Okay. Finally made a breakthrough. They found it. Well, not exactly. Where was it hiding this whole time? They didn't find it, they created it. What? They bombarded bismuth with alpha particles in a cyclotron. Okay, hold on. A cyclotron is basically a particle accelerator. It smashes atoms together at incredibly high speeds. Wait, so they didn't stumble upon this in nature. They actually like synthesized it? That completely changes how we usually think of discovering elements. Right. You mentioned a cyclotron. Yeah. Explain to me like I'm five how you create an element that doesn't exist in nature. Okay, so imagine you have a microscopic game of billiards. Okay. You're shooting alpha particles, which are like tiny, positively charged bullets, at a target made of bismuth atoms. Okay. If you hit the bismuth atom just right with enough energy, the nuclei can fuse together and transform into a new element, in this case astatine. So it's like atomic alchemy. It really is. They're literally smashing atoms together to create something new that's mind-blowing. It is pretty amazing. But why is naturally occurring astatine so rare in the first place? Because it's incredibly unstable. Okay. It's like a flash in the pan. As soon as it's formed, it starts to decay rapidly. Oh, wow. All of its isotopes have incredibly short half-lives. Uh-huh. The most stable one, astatine 210, has a half-life of just 8.1 hours. So half of it disappears every eight hours. That's right. No wonder we're not exactly tripping over it in the wild. Right. And this whole vaporizing itself thing has me intrigued. Yeah. So if we could somehow magically gather a visible amount of astatine, what would that look like? Yeah. Would it be like a glowing orb of doom? Or would it just vanish in a puff of smoke? Imagine a tiny speck of intensely hot glowing matter. Okay. The energy released as its atoms decay would be so powerful that it wouldn't just melt. It would literally boil away into radioactive vapor. Wow. It'd be quite a sight and probably a very bad idea to be anywhere nearby. Noted. I'm definitely adding avoid visible samples of astatine to my to-do list. Oh, good idea. But even though it's so elusive, scientists have managed to learn a bit about its properties, right? They have. What makes astatine so unique? It's a bit of a chameleon, actually. Okay. It shares some similarities with its halogen siblings, like iodine, but it also exhibits some metallic tendencies. Interesting. Some researchers believe it might even behave as a superconductor under certain conditions. Wait, a superconductor? Yeah. Like those materials that can conduct electricity with zero resistance? Exactly. Aren't those used in things like MRI machines and maglev trains? They are. Why is that so significant? Well, superconductors have incredible potential for various technologies because they eliminate energy loss during transmission. If astatine could indeed form a dense metallic phase, as some models predict, it could open up a whole new world of possibilities. Okay, now that's what I'm talking about. Right. A superconductor that's also radioactive, that's just begging for some sci-fi applications. I know, right? But let's not get too ahead of ourselves. Sure. Before we start building levitating trains powered by astatine, let's dig a little deeper into how this all works. Sounds like a plan. Next, we'll explore those metallic tendencies and delve into that fascinating world of astatine's radioactive properties. Perfect. Stay tuned because things are about to get really interesting. I can't wait. It's fascinating, isn't it? I know, right? How something so rare and fleeting, born from the heart of stars, could hold the potential to alter the course of human health. I know, right? Last time we left off with this idea that astatine might even act like a superconductor. Right. But what really caught my attention was its potential use in treating cancer. Absolutely. I mean, it's barely here, and yet it could have a huge impact on how we fight cancer in the future. Huge. Let's break down this whole targeted alpha therapy thing. Okay. How does it actually work? Imagine a microscopic tumor. Okay. Perhaps one that's difficult to remove surgically or one that has spread. Okay, got it. A tricky tumor situation. Now, with astatine-211, the goal is to attach it to a carrier molecule. Okay. That acts like a guided missile zeroing in on those cancerous cells. So it's like sneaking a tiny assassin right into the enemy's hideout. Exactly. This carrier could be an antibody, a peptide, or even a nanoparticle, something that specifically targets those cancerous cells. Like a Trojan horse sneaking astatine-211 right into the heart of the tumor. Precisely. And once inside, the astatine-211 releases its alpha particles, which act like highly focused energy blasts. Okay. Remember, these particles have a very limited range, like a sniper bullet hitting its arc. So maximum damage to the cancer cells with minimal collateral damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. That's incredible. That's the idea. But last time we talked about some challenges with this approach. Right. What are the biggest hurdles researchers are facing? Well, dehalogenation is a major one. Dehalogenation. It's a bit like a delivery truck losing its cargo before reaching its destination. Okay. The astatine-211 can detach from the carrier molecule before it reaches the tumor, reducing its effectiveness. So finding a really secure delivery truck is crucial. Absolutely. What about radiolysis? Yes. Astatine-211's intense radioactivity can break down molecules, right? It's like having a package that's so radioactive, it starts to damage the delivery truck itself. Wow. Scientists are trying to find ways to protect the carrier molecules from this damage, as well as exploring different astatine isotopes that might be less damaging. So finding the right balance between potency and stability is key. Oh, exactly. It's like trying to design a delivery truck that's both incredibly strong and incredibly stealthy. Good analogy. But even if they can overcome those challenges, isn't producing enough astatine-211 a major obstacle? Absolutely. It's incredibly rare and difficult to make. Right. Currently, we rely on bombarding bismuth with alpha particles in cyclotrons. Uh-huh. But those facilities are limited, and the process is quite complex. I read that some researchers are experimenting with alternative production methods. Yes. Like using proton beams instead of alpha particles. That's right. They're exploring the possibility of bombarding different target materials, like thorium or uranium, to produce radon-211, which then decays into astatine-211. It's like finding a different recipe to cook up this rare element. Does that approach have any advantages? Potentially, it could lead to larger quantities of astatine-211 being produced. Okay. However, it's not a simple swap. Right. There are still technical hurdles to overcome. Uh-huh. And it carries the risk of contamination with other isotopes, like astatine-210, which decays into that highly toxic polonium-210. Right. We talked about that before. Yes. Polonium-210 is not something you want hanging around. Definitely not. So it sounds like there's a lot of intricate research happening in the field of astatine-211 for cancer treatment. It really is. But what about other medical applications? Are there any other areas where this element could be useful? Well, targeted alpha therapy is the main focus.
