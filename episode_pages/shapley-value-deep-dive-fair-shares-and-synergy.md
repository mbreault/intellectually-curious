## Description

We explore the Shapley valueâ€”how to fairly allocate value among collaborators in any group. From coalitional games to marginal contributions, learn how synergy and timing matter, and what fairness properties (efficiency, symmetry, linearity) guide fair allocations, with real-world examples from startups and teams.

## Transcript

Welcome back to the deep dive. Today we're tackling something. Oh, this is exciting. That sounds a bit intimidating at first. Right. But trust me, it's super cool. It's called the Shapley value. Yeah. You ever think about like those situations where people work together and they create something awesome? Absolutely. It could be anything, right? Yeah. Like a company's profit or like a victory for a sports team. Right. The Shapley value, what this does is it helps us figure out fairly how much each person contributed. Okay. And we're going beyond just like splitting things evenly, right? Exactly. It's about fairness based on what each person brought to the table. Yeah. And even when like those contributions are all mixed up together, it's like, how do you separate those out? But that's the key. It recognizes that in most real world scenarios, contributions aren't isolated. Right. They're interacting. Yeah. And they're building on each other. Absolutely. And to delve into this concept, we are going to be using excerpts from the Wikipedia article on Shapley value. All right. Classic. So to kind of set the stage here, we need to understand what a coalitional game is. Right. To be honest with you, when I first heard that term, it sounded way more complicated than it really is. It sounds very jargony. It does. It does. Let's break it down. Yeah, let's do it. So imagine you have a group of players. Okay. That could be people in a business, athletes on a team, or even just different parts of a machine learning model. Oh, wow. So this is our group. Okay. This is our N. Our N. And now we need a way to measure the value that each possible combination of players can create. Okay. So we have a way of saying, okay, if we put these two people together, how much value can they create? Got it. We call this the characteristic function. Okay. Or think of it like a recipe book. Each recipe needs specific ingredients to make a dish. Yeah. And each dish has its own unique value. Right. Or in our case, like taste. Okay. So the characteristic function tells us how much value or taste any group of players can create. Yes. But how do we go from there to saying, okay, you get this much of the reward because of what you brought to the table? That's the million dollar question. That is. That's where the Shapley value formula comes in, right? Exactly. And the formula itself can look a bit scary. Okay. But the idea behind it is pretty elegant. Okay. Picture each player joining the coalition. Right. Or joining the recipe, if you will. Okay. One by one. All right. Each time a player joins, they're bringing something new to the mix, right? Yeah. And that changes the overall value. Okay. And that change is their marginal contribution. Okay. So what the Shapley value does is it calculates the average of a player's marginal contributions across every single possible order. Oh, wow. That they could have joined the group. It's not just about how much value you add when you join. Exactly. It's about when you join. It's about the order. Let's make this more specific. Okay, yeah. Imagine a tech startup, right? You've got the founder with the brilliant idea. Of course. Right. And then you have the developers. Yeah. The marketers, the salespeople. Yep. All joining the team at different stages. How would the Shapley value apply to them? Let's say the founder comes up with a game-changing app idea. Okay. On their own. Yeah. They might be able to achieve a certain level of success. Yeah. But when a talented developer joins, suddenly the app becomes a reality and the value skyrockets. It's actually like a real thing, right? Yeah. It's not just an idea anymore. It's a product. Exactly. Then, later on, a marketing whiz comes on board. Okay. Launches this brilliant campaign that brings in millions of users. Right. Each person's contribution is amplified by those who came before and after them. So even though the founder had the initial spark. Yeah. The Shapley value is recognizing that the developer and the marketer are crucial in turning that spark into a raging fire. Right. They're all part of the success. It's not about taking away from anyone's importance. Exactly. It's about acknowledging that the timing and the combination of all these contributions really matter. Yeah, it's the whole ecosystem. This is making me think about team dynamics in a whole new way. Precisely. Wow. The Shapley value helps us see beyond just individual efforts. Yeah. And appreciate how those efforts interact to create something bigger than themselves. Okay, so this brings us to the concept of synergy. Yeah. Which I have to admit, when I first heard it, it just sounded like a bunch of corporate buzzwords. I feel you. But in the context of the Shapley value, it takes on a whole new meaning. It really does. Explain that to me. How does synergy fit into all of this? Think of synergy as like the special sauce that emerges when the right ingredients come together. Okay, I like that. It's the value created by the group that's greater than the sum of what each individual could have achieved on their own. Okay, so remember our tech startup example. Yeah. The founder, the developer, the marketer. Yeah. Together, they created something far more valuable than any of them could have done individually. Oh. That extra value, that synergy. Okay, so synergy is like that click moment. Yeah, like magic. When a team just gels. And their combined efforts are greater than the sum of their parts. You got it. And how does this relate back to the Shapley value formula? Right. Is there a way to actually calculate synergy? Absolutely. Okay. So remember the characteristic function. Yeah, our recipe book. Our recipe book, right. It allows us to calculate the value of each group. Okay. Including the group with all the players. Okay. By comparing that total value to the sum of the individual values. Okay. We can isolate the value. Okay. That emerged purely from collaboration. Gotcha. And that's the synergy. Wow. So we can actually put a number on that special sauce. We can quantify it. So does that mean that the Shapley value considers synergy when it's determining each person's share of the rewards? You got it. Okay. There's actually an alternate way to express the Shapley value formula. Oh, wow. That directly relates to synergy. Okay. It tells us that a player's share of the overall value is proportional to the synergy of all of the groups or recipes that they're a part of. Okay. I'm seeing how this ties together. It's all connected. So in our startup example, the founder is involved in all the high-synergy combinations, right? Right. Founder-developer, founder-marketer, and then the whole team together. The whole shebang. So their share of the rewards would be higher. Right. Because they're consistently part of the groups that are creating that extra oomph. That extra oomph, exactly. This is making me rethink how we evaluate contributions in all sorts of scenarios. And that's one of the beautiful things about the Shapley value. Yeah. Is it helps us move beyond simplistic assessments of individual effort. Yeah. And appreciate the intricate web of contributions that lead to success. This has been incredible so far. It's really fascinating stuff. We have explored the basic idea of a coalitional game. Yeah. Unpacked the Shapley value formula a little bit. Uh-huh. And uncovered this concept of synergy. I'm already starting to see how this seemingly abstract mathematical concept can have real-world implications. It really can. But before we get into those applications, can we delve a little deeper into the characteristics of the Shapley value itself? Of course we can. What makes it such a compelling concept of fairness? You're asking the right questions. Okay. So what makes the Shapley value so robust is its inherent properties. Okay. These properties are what make it so powerful for ensuring fairness in how we distribute rewards or costs. Oh, okay. So it's not just about the math. Yeah. It's about the principles behind it. Yeah. I like that. So let's dive into those properties. Let's do it. Shall we? Yeah, let's do it. So we were talking about these properties of the Shapley value that make it so compelling. Yeah. When it comes to fairness. When it comes to fairness. What exactly are they? Okay. So first off, it's efficient. Okay. All of the value gets distributed. Okay. Nothing gets wasted. Okay. So if a team achieves a certain goal or a company makes a profit, the Shapley value makes sure that every bit of that value is accounted for and distributed among the contributors. That makes sense. It wouldn't be very fair if some of the value just disappeared, right? Exactly. You want to make sure everything's accounted for. What else? Another key property is symmetry. Okay. If two players contribute equally to the overall value, they get equal shares. Okay. So it doesn't play favorites. I like that. It's purely based on the value each person brings to the table. Yeah. Regardless of their title, seniority, any other factors. It levels the playing field. Exactly. It ensures that everyone is judged based on their actual contribution. On their merits. Are there any other properties that stand out to you? There's linearity. Okay. If the overall value of the game increases, the rewards scale up proportionally. Okay. So imagine our startup from earlier. They suddenly get acquired for a huge sum of money. Yeah, big exit. Big exit, right? Okay. The Shapley value makes
