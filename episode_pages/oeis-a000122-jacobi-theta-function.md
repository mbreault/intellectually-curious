## Transcript

Welcome back to our deep dive series into the OEIS. Ah, yes. The online encyclopedia of integer sequences. One of my favorite places to spend a Friday night. If you're joining us for the first time... Oh, that's great. The OEIS is a vast online database of... You guessed it. Integer sequences. Integers all the way down. And it's truly a goldmine for anyone who studies number theory. That's us. And that's why we're dedicating this entire series to it. To really pull out some of the gems. The coolest entries in the OEIS. Absolutely. And today we're going to dive into a sequence that seems... Unassuming. Deceptively simple. Yes. 000122. You might also know it as the expansion of the Jacobi theta function. Theta 3 of x. But don't worry. Don't let the fancy names scare you. We're going to break it all down. Nice and easy. Even if you've never seen a theta function before. That's right. So let's just start with the basics. Okay. What does 000122 actually look like? Where are we at? Let's look at the first few terms. Okay. One. Two. Two. Zero. Zero. Two. Zero. Zero. Okay, so I'm seeing... Now what's the pattern? Okay, it looks like it's just zeros and twos. But there's something about the placement of those twos. Yeah. Where are they? That's what I'm trying to figure out. Okay, you got it. They show up in the square positions. Oh. One, four, nine, sixteen. Okay. And so on. Gotcha. And that visual pattern. Okay. That's directly related to the mathematical definition of this sequence. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay, so what's the connection? A000122 represents the number of ways you can express an integer as the sum of two squares. So for example, the first term is one. Right. Because there's only one way to write one as the sum of two squares. Right, one squared plus zero squared. Exactly. The second term is two because there are two ways to write four as the sum of two squares. Okay, so two squared plus zero squared and zero squared plus two squared. You got it. Okay. So every time we hit a perfect square in the sequence, we get a two. Yeah. Because we have those two symmetrical representations. Ah, I see. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Okay, good. Okay, so this is where the... The big scary. The Jacobi theta function. Theta 3 of x. Comes in. Yes. Okay, theta functions. I have to admit, I kind of... A little mysterious. A little mysterious. Yeah. For those of us... For those of us who haven't really... Who haven't worked with them. Worked with them much. Yeah. They can seem a little intimidating at first. Yeah. But honestly, at their heart... Okay. They're just infinite sums. Okay. With a specific structure. Okay. In this case, the formula for theta 3 of x is a sum of terms that look like x to the m squared. Okay. Where m runs through all the integers. Okay, so each term represents a possible square. Okay. And when you expand that infinite sum... Okay. You get a power series. Right. Where the coefficients of each x to the n term tells you how many ways you can express n as the sum of two squares. Oh, okay. So the coefficients in the expansion of theta 3 of x are literally the terms of our... A000122 sequence. That's right. Beautiful connection. That is really cool. It is. So we have this seemingly simple sequence. Yeah. And this really powerful mathematical function. And they're tied together in this really elegant way. That's amazing. I know, it's pretty cool. Okay, so we've established this connection between the sequence and the theta function. Yep. So where do we go from here? Well, let's explore some of the implications of this connection. Okay, I'm ready. Okay, good. So we've got this really cool connection between this sequence and the theta function. Where can we go with this? Well, remember how we were saying like A000122? Yes. It tells us like how many ways we can represent an integer as the sum of two squares. Right. That was like the core definition. Exactly. Well, there's actually a formula. Oh. That relates the three of x directly to r2 of n. R2 of n. Yeah. You know, the math notation for the number of ways to represent n as the sum of two squares. Okay, so by understanding this sequence and its connection to the theta function, we're basically like unlocking this classic problem in number theory. It's a classic problem. Of representing integers as sums of squares. Exactly. And that's just the beginning. Oh, there's more. There's always more. Okay, hit me. Well, A000122 is also linked to things like Ramanujan's theta functions. Oh, Ramanujan. Yeah. Okay. His work is always so fascinating. It is, right? What's the connection there? Well, Ramanujan developed his own set of theta functions. Okay. And they have like wide ranging applications in number theory. And guess what? A000122 is related to one of them. No way. That's wild. I know. Okay. It's really cool. So this one sequence is like a bridge connecting all these different areas. Different parts of number theory. It really is. It's amazing. Yeah. And it goes even beyond number theory. What? Yeah. Holy. For instance, A000122 has a connection to the Luoville function. The Luoville function. I'm not familiar with that one. So the Luoville function, it basically assigns a value of one or minus one to each positive integer based on the number of prime factors it has. Okay. So it might seem kind of unrelated. Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. To what we've been talking about. Yeah. But there's a link. Wow. I know it's pretty surprising. Yeah. You wouldn't expect that. So we've got the theta functions. Uh-huh. We've got Ramanujan. Right. We've got the Luoville function. Yeah. It feels like the deeper we dig. Yeah. Into A000122, the more connections we find. That's the beauty of math. It's true. Right. It's all connected. Yeah. And there are even more connections we could talk about. Oh, really? Yeah. Like A000122. Yeah. It's related to things like lattices. Oh, okay. And modular forms. Okay. Those I'm a little more familiar with. Yeah. From your studies. Number theory studies. Yeah. But it's just crazy that... I know, it's amazing. They all tie back to this one sequence. It is. It's one simple sequence. It's really cool. So it's like this one little like key unlocks all this. It unlocks all these doors to all these different concepts. That's incredible. It is. This is making me want to go back and revisit all my... Revisit your notes. Yeah. Oh, I love that. Yeah. My number theory notes. Yeah, you should. All these concepts that I learned... Right. ...like in isolation. Yeah. It's so cool to see how they're all... All connected. And you know, if you're looking for like more to explore... Uh-huh. ...the OEIS entry for A000122... Yes. ...it's a treasure trove. It really is. ...of information. Okay. It's got tons of formulas and references and links to other sequences. That's a great reminder. Yeah. You should check it out. I'm gonna have to spend some time there. Yeah, it's a great resource. But let's shift gears a little bit. Okay. And talk about some of the properties of A000122. Okay. Like the sequence itself. Hmm. What are some of the things that stand out? Well, there are a few interesting quirks. Oh, really? One is the asymptotic mean. Asymptotic mean. Yeah. Okay, remind me what that means. So basically it describes the average behavior of a sequence as you look at more and more terms. So like if you took the average of the first 100 terms, you'd get a certain value. Okay. And then if you took the average of the first 1,000 terms, you'd get another value. Gotcha. The asymptotic mean is the value that those averages approach as you take larger and larger sets of terms. Okay, so it's like what the average is approaching. Exactly. As you go to infinity. I remember that now. Okay, good. Okay, so what's interesting about the asymptotic mean? Okay, so for A000122, the asymptotic mean is 2 pi over 5. Wait, hold on. It's pretty wild. This sequence is just zeros and twos. I know. How does pi get involved? I know, right? It's pretty surprising. Yeah. But that's what makes it so interesting. It just shows you the unexpected connections that can pop up. So these simple terms lead to this behavior that involves pi. Exactly. Wow, I'm gonna have to think about that for a minute. Yeah, it's pretty mind blowing. Okay, so are there any other surprising properties? There's one more I want to mention. Okay. It involves something called Dirichlet convolution. Dirichlet convolution. Yeah, for those of us who aren't familiar. So Dirichlet convolution is basically a way of combining two arithmetic functions. So imagine you have two functions. Let's call them f of n and g of n, defined on positive integers. The Dirichlet convolution of those two functions creates a new function. Let's call it h of n. And the value of h of n is found by taking a sum
