## Description

Trace the rise, the wrenching revisions after stagflation, and the modern debate over whether unemployment and inflation trade off. From Phillips's UK data to Friedman and Phelps's expectations, the natural rate, and the Fed's role in flattening the curve, this episode also explores new approachesâ€”like behavioral economicsâ€”that aim to explain todayâ€™s puzzling relationship and its policy implications.

## Transcript

All right, so you hear this phrase thrown around a lot, the Phillips curve, and you're interested in getting a handle on it. Well, we've got a stack of articles and research here, so we're going to take a deep dive into just what exactly is this Phillips curve and why should we care? Well, it all goes back to this economist A.W. Phillips back in the 1950s. He looked at about a century's worth of UK data from 1861 to 1957. Wow, that's a lot of data. It is, a whole century. And he noticed this pretty interesting pattern when it came to unemployment and wage increases. Okay, unemployment and wages. I see where this might be going. Yeah, so he found that when unemployment was low, wages tended to rise more quickly, kind of like they were on a seesaw. One goes up, the other goes down. Right, okay, yeah, that makes sense. So more jobs, more competition for workers, companies got to pay more to attract talent. Exactly, classic supply and demand, right? Yep, so that's just wages, right? I'm guessing this Phillips curve is about more than just wages, right? You got it. This is where economists like Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow come in. They took Phillips' work and said, hmm, this relationship between unemployment and wages, maybe it applies to overall prices, not just wages. That's how the Phillips curve as we know it was born. Oh, okay, so instead of just wages going up when jobs are plentiful, the cost of everything increases. Exactly. Okay, yeah, that makes it a much bigger deal for sure. I mean, especially if you're the one managing the household budget and everything's getting more expensive. Absolutely, yeah, and this is where it gets really interesting because think about it from a policymaker's perspective. If you're trying to manage a country's economy, you'd love to have low unemployment, but you also want to keep prices stable. Right. But the Phillips curve seemed to suggest that you might have to choose one or the other. Oh, I see, it's a trade-off. Right, like do you risk higher inflation to get people back to work or do you try to keep inflation under control but maybe have more people out of work? Tough choices. No wonder this curve caught on, right? I mean, but it sounds almost too simple, right? Like was it really that simple, this trade-off? Yeah, well, you know, the 1970s had other plans. Oh, no, here we go. Yeah, the 1970s kind of threw a wrench in the works with something called stagflation, high inflation, high unemployment all at the same time. Whoa, so like the worst of both worlds. Exactly, yeah, it's like a double whammy. And the Phillips curve was supposed to be this trade-off, not this like simultaneous problem. Okay, so did the Phillips curve just break? Well, not exactly break, but it definitely needed a serious rethink. And that's where Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps came in. They argued that this trade-off the Phillips curve showed, it was only a short-term thing. Oh, interesting. So it wasn't the whole story. No, definitely not the whole story. They said that over the long term, people's expectations about inflation play a huge role. Like if people expect inflation to be high, they're going to demand higher wages. And then businesses will raise prices even more in anticipation of, you know, further inflation and so on. It becomes like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Oh, okay, so like even if the economy isn't actually in a state of high inflation, if people just think it's going to happen. Right, exactly. Then it will. Yeah, pretty much. Wow, okay, that's fascinating. So it's not just about how many jobs are out there or the actual prices, but what people think will happen in the future. Exactly. And this ties into the idea of the natural rate of unemployment. You've probably heard that term thrown around before, right? I have, yeah. But to be honest, I'm not really sure what it means. Well, that was another thing Friedman and Phelps brought to the table. It's often called next ARU, non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. And basically it's this idea that there's a limit to how low unemployment can go before you start triggering accelerating inflation. Oh, I see. So you can't just keep pushing for lower and lower unemployment without consequences. Right. There's this sweet spot, right, where the economy is doing well, people have jobs, but inflation isn't out of control. Okay. That makes sense. So what these guys figured out, I mean, it was groundbreaking enough to win them Nobel Prizes, right? Yeah. It was a big deal. So let's bring it up to today. I mean, in recent years, we've seen really low unemployment, but inflation hasn't gone crazy, right? So how does the Phillips curve fit into what's been happening lately? Yeah, that's a great question. And it gets us to another twist in the story, the flattened Phillips curve. A flattened curve. Yeah, so one of our sources here is this article from the St. Louis Fed. And they talk about how we've had record low unemployment in the US, but inflation has remained relatively tame, not what we'd expect from the traditional Phillips curve. So the relationship we used to see, it's not as strong anymore. Yeah. And this St. Louis Fed article quotes James Mullard, the president of the St. Louis Fed. He says, and I quote, if you put it in a murder mystery framework, who killed the Phillips curve? It was the Fed that killed the Phillips curve. Wait, the Fed killed it? Yeah, that's what he said. What does that even mean? Well, it's a provocative way of saying that maybe by focusing so intently on keeping inflation under control for the past few decades, the Fed might have actually weakened the Phillips curve relationship. So by keeping inflation in check, they removed the inflation that used to happen with low unemployment. Exactly, yeah. So it's like they removed that pressure. So is this related to that whole anchored expectations thing? Oh yeah, absolutely. It's a key part of it. You see, if everyone believes prices will stay stable, businesses are less likely to raise prices, and workers are less likely to demand big raises. So it kind of creates this self-fulfilling prophecy of low inflation. Oh, I see. Okay, yeah, that's fascinating. But does the current head of the Fed, Jerome Powell, does he buy into this whole murder mystery thing? Well, he doesn't use that phrase. But Powell has said that the relationship between unemployment and inflation, it's weakened. He even compared it to a faint heartbeat, strong 50 years ago, but much weaker today. Wow. So the head of the Fed is admitting that this once powerful relationship, it's not what it used to be. That's got to be significant. Right. So what's his take on why that is? Well, he seems to agree with this anchored expectations idea. He says if people believe inflation will stay low, it probably will. It's like a psychological component to the whole thing. Oh, wow. Yeah, expectations influencing reality. That is fascinating. But is everyone on board with this? Well, that's a great question. And it leads us to this ongoing debate amongst economists about how relevant the Phillips curve even is today. Some economists, they still see it as a valuable tool, especially in the short term. Others, they say it's just too simple given how complex the economy is today. Right. Okay, so there's still this debate, which is interesting. And it's not just some academic thing either, right? Like these different interpretations, they affect real world decisions, don't they? They absolutely do. Different views on the Phillips curve can lead to drastically different approaches to managing the economy, like deciding whether to raise or lower interest rates or to stimulate or restrain spending. It's all tied to how policymakers understand this link between jobs and prices. Wow. Okay. So clearly there's a lot more to unpack here. Oh, yeah, for sure. It has real world consequences, these different ideas about the Phillips curve. Yeah, absolutely. And we've seen the Phillips curve, I mean, even with all these different interpretations, it's really only one part of this bigger economic puzzle, right? Yeah, exactly. There's a ton of other things to consider too, like technological advancements, globalization, even automation. All these things impact the labor market and prices in ways that the Phillips curve, well, maybe it doesn't quite capture it all anymore. Right, it's just a much bigger picture than it used to be. Yeah. So where do we even begin to wrap our heads around all of this? I mean, if a tool like the Phillips curve maybe isn't giving us the full story anymore. Yeah, it's definitely a challenge, for sure. There's no easy answer, but I think the first step is to acknowledge that we can't just keep relying on these old models and assumptions, right? We need to be open to new ideas, new data, new ways of thinking about all this. Okay, I'm ready. I want to hear about these new approaches. What are economists doing to understand this really complex economic picture? Well, one area that's getting a lot of attention is behavioral economics. Oh, yeah, I've heard of that. Yeah, so this field, it kind of dives into the psychology of economics, right? How people make decisions. Oh, interesting. So it's not just numbers and equations, it's about how people actually behave. Yeah, exactly. Because people aren't always rational. Right, of course. So, you know, emotions and biases and social influences, they all play a role. That makes total sense. So understanding how people actually behave in these economic situations, it can give us some really valuable insights. Yeah,
