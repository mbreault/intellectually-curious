## Description

In this episode, we demystify Poisson distributions and show how they model random events with a steady average rateâ€”like daily demand, arrivals, or failures. Using real-world supply chain examples (coats sold per day, reorder points with lead times, staffing, machine maintenance), we explain how to estimate lambda, compute probabilities, and set stocking levels. We also cover limitations (independence, seasonality) and how to layer in seasonal patterns and expert judgment, plus how to handle black-swan events with data-driven tools. A practical, accessible tour of the math behind everyday operations.

## Transcript

All right, let's dive into something a little unexpected today, Poisson distributions. Poisson distributions. Now, I know what you might be thinking, math, on this show. Yeah. But trust me on this one, this is all about understanding those seemingly random events that pop up, and they pop up a lot when we're talking about supply chains. Yeah, you know, Poisson distributions are really interesting. What's fascinating is they give us this framework. It helps us understand events that, yeah, they happen kind of randomly, you know, but they have this consistent average rate. It happens over time, and it's not about like pinpointing the exact moment something's going to happen. Right. It's more about, you know, how likely are different scenarios. Okay, so it's less about knowing when and more about how likely. Exactly. Got it. So how does that apply to the real world though? I mean, specifically when we're talking about supply chains. Okay, so think about a company that sells, let's say, winter coats, right? You can't predict the exact day someone's going to buy a coat, but you can look at past sales data, and you can see, you know, how many coats on average are sold per day or per week or per month. Right. And that average, that becomes like the key ingredient in our Poisson calculations. So we're using past data to get a sense of future demand, even though we know that, you know, we can't predict what any individual customer is going to do. Exactly. Okay, so that makes sense to me. And this kind of leads us to inventory management. Yes. I mean, we've talked about this on the show before, this classic dilemma. You don't want warehouses just packed with products that aren't moving, but you also don't want to run out. Absolutely. Nightmare. Big nightmare. So how does Poisson help companies find that sweet spot? You know, how much is too much? Well, it's all about managing uncertainty. We don't have a crystal ball. I wish we did. Yeah. But what we can do is we can use Poisson. Okay. And we can look at that historical sales data, and we can figure out, okay, what's the average demand rate for a certain product? And mathematicians, they call this lambda, that average lambda. And then using the Poisson formula, we can calculate the probability of, okay, well, how likely are we to need X number of units within a certain timeframe? So if lambda is, let's just say, 100 coats per day on average, we can use Poisson to say, okay, what's the probability that we're only going to sell 50 tomorrow? What's the probability we're going to sell 200 tomorrow? Exactly. And then you can use that information to figure out, well, how much inventory should I actually have on hand? Interesting. So that brings us to this idea of reorder points. Reorder points, yes. So when a company knows, okay, it's time to restock, how does Poisson fit into that? Well, so it's that level of inventory where you say, okay, I need to place a new order. Got it. Because I don't want to run out of stock before the next shipment gets here. Right. And so you have to think about not only, okay, well, how much am I selling, but also how long does it take to get that new inventory in? Lead times. Lead times, exactly. And so let's say, you know, your coat supplier takes, I don't know, two weeks to deliver. Well, we can use Poisson and we can figure out, okay, over those two weeks, what's the probability that I'm going to sell, you know, 50 coats? What's the probability I'm going to sell 200 coats? Right. And then you set that reorder point to a level that minimizes the risk of, oh no, I sold out while I'm waiting for those new coats to get here. Got it. So even though those individual purchases are still unpredictable, the Poisson distributions help us manage that overall flow and take into account, you know, things like lead times from our suppliers. Absolutely. And you know what's really interesting is that we can apply similar logic to think about things like staffing levels. Wait, really? So you're saying we can use Poisson to determine how many employees we need on a given day? Absolutely. So think about like a retail store. Okay. You know, they can use Poisson distributions and they can look at, okay, what are the traffic patterns? You know, how many customers are coming in on a Monday versus a Friday versus a Saturday? And then they staff accordingly. So instead of just kind of going with their gut or, you know, scheduling everyone for the busiest possible day, they can look at data to figure out what's most likely. Exactly. It's all about trying to optimize, you know, making sure you have good customer service, but also managing your labor costs. This is really making me think differently about how much math is kind of behind the scenes and all these everyday experiences. I never would have thought about that for staffing. So are there other areas where this kind of pops up? Oh yeah, all over the place. Even something like, you know, machine maintenance. Oh wow. Okay, so how does math help us maintain machines? So you can use Poisson, you know, you look at historical data. Okay. When did these machines break down? Right. And you can actually use that information to predict, well, how likely is it that this machine is going to have a breakdown within, let's say, the next month? So instead of waiting for something to break down, we can use these calculations to say, okay, let's proactively schedule maintenance here, minimize that downtime. Exactly. It's all about understanding the probability of these events and then taking action based on that information. So this is all incredibly useful, I'm seeing that. But I imagine there are also some limitations, right? Oh yeah. Because the real world is rarely as neat and tidy as, you know, a mathematical formula. Absolutely. I mean, one of the key assumptions built into the Poisson model is that the events have to be independent. Independent. Yeah. So going back to our coat example, one person buying a coat shouldn't affect whether or not another person buys a coat. That makes sense. But what about things like social media trends? You know, everyone's suddenly got to have the same coat or a cold snap hits, right? Yeah. That would definitely influence people. So in those cases, that independence assumption kind of breaks down. You got it. You hit it right on the head. That's one of the limitations. You know, you've got these external factors, you've got promotions, you've got word of mouth. And that's where, you know, it's really important to be aware of the limitations of the model and make adjustments as needed. So then what about seasonality? Yeah. We were talking earlier about winter coats, right? Demand is not going to be consistent throughout the year. Yeah. So how do we account for that? Because the basic Poisson distributions, they kind of assume that steady average. They do. And that's another key consideration here. Seasonality. Right. Real life, it's rarely that simple. Never that simple. So does that mean Poisson becomes useless in those situations? Not at all. Not at all. It just means we have to get a little more sophisticated. We've got to layer in some additional techniques. Okay. So how do we make it work when we know that nice, steady average is just not realistic? Well, you know, we can incorporate historical data on these seasonal trends. Okay. So let's go back to those coats. Okay. We know from past years, you know, demand tends to surge in the fall and the winter. Right. Drops off in the spring and summer. Of course. So we can use that past data to sort of adjust our Poisson calculations. Exactly. Make them more accurate. And you can identify, okay, what's the typical increase? You know, is it a 20% increase in demand during December? Right. Is it a 50% increase? You look at those patterns. And so in December, if we know historically demand is, let's say, 50% higher than the average, our calculation would factor that in. Exactly. And that's going to give you a much more realistic probability of, okay, how many coats am I actually going to need in December? Okay. That's starting to paint a clearer picture. Good. So we're using Poisson as a foundation, but then layering in these real world things. Yes. Like seasonal patterns. Right. But things can get pretty complex, though, I imagine, if you've got products that have multiple peaks and valleys. Oh, absolutely. You're talking multiple seasons. You're talking different trends. Right. A lot of times, companies will rely on specialized forecasting software to manage that. Okay. And these tools, they'll analyze huge amounts of data. Wow. And they'll find those intricate seasonal patterns, and then they'll automatically adjust those Poisson calculations. So this isn't something you want to be doing by hand with a calculator? Not really. Okay. You need some heavy duty tools. But even with those tools, we're still relying heavily on past data, right? What about those unforeseen events? Those things that nobody can predict? Yeah. How do we account for those curveballs? That is the million dollar question. Right. Because you're right, historical data can only take us so far. Yeah. It's essential to layer in human judgment, human expertise. Yeah. Because you're always going to have those black swan events, those things that nobody sees coming, and they can really throw a wrench in things. Black swan events. Yeah. So for those of us who maybe haven't heard that term before? Oh yeah. So black swan event, this is an unpredictable event
