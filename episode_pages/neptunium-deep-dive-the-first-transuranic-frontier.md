## Transcript

Welcome back everyone to the Deep Dive. Today we're going to be doing things a little differently. Yeah, we're going deep on just a single element. Interesting. So we've got a whole stack of research and articles here all about Neptunium. Neptunium. Yeah, and you know, you might be thinking, Neptunium, is that even a real thing? Is it on the periodic table? It is. Okay, good. It is. So at least we're not totally making stuff up. No. Okay, good. Definitely a real element. And it's named after the planet Neptune. It is. Okay, so at least we get that going for it. Yeah. Sounds pretty cool already. What's really intriguing about Neptunium is that it's the first transuranic element. Transuranic. Yeah. That sounds like something out of Star Trek. It kind of does. What does that even mean? It means beyond uranium. Oh. So on the periodic table, you're picturing Neptunium is hanging out after uranium. Oh, so it's like the frontier. Yeah, you could say that. Wow. In a realm of elements that aren't naturally found here on Earth. Oh, so this stuff is not just lying around. Not really, no. For the most part, these elements are created by us. Wow. So we're really getting into the edge of chemistry here. Absolutely. We are venturing into the realm of synthetic elements. Okay, so let's jump into this deep dive and try to understand what makes Neptunium tick. Sounds good. What are its properties? How was it discovered? And why should we even care? Great questions. Okay, so first up, let's get to know Neptunium's personality a little bit. Right. Our sources describe it as a hard, silvery metal that tarnishes in the air. Right, and that tarnish is a clue to its reactivity. Yeah. It reacts with oxygen, just like iron rusting. But instead of that reddish-brown, you get a thin oxide layer forming on the surface. So it's not exactly like something you'd want to wear as jewelry, then? Probably not the best choice for a necklace. Okay, good to know. But it does have that silvery metallic look initially. Okay, so it's reactive. But here's what throws me off. Our sources mention that it has a surprisingly low melting point. Interesting. Right. And get this, plutonium, its neighbor on the periodic table, also has a low melting point. Yeah, they're both pretty unusual in that regard for such heavy elements. Is that a coincidence? Not at all. It's all about how the electrons are arranged in these elements. Electrons. Yes, we're talking about the 5 and 6B orbitals. Those sound complicated. They can be, but think of it like mixing two primary colors of paint. Okay. You get a new color with its own unique properties. I'm following. In Neptunium and Plutonium, these 5 and 6B electron orbitals, they kind of blend in a special way. Okay. Creating directional bonds that affect how tightly the atoms are held together in the solid. Interesting. And that, in turn, influences the melting point. So these invisible electron things are actually having a real-world impact on stuff that we can see and touch. Exactly. They're tiny, but they have a big influence. That's wild. But wait, there's more, right? There is? Neptunium has this other quirk. Okay. It can exist in multiple forms. They're called allotropes. Precisely. What does that even mean? It's similar to how carbon can be diamond or graphite. Oh. Same element, different arrangement of atoms, drastically different properties. So like one minute it's like a diamond and the next minute it's a pencil lead. Well, not exactly. Okay. But you get the idea. Okay. The way the atoms are arranged really matters. So Neptunium's allotropes mean that its density can change and even its radioactivity can be affected. That's right. Okay, so to recap, we're talking about an element that's reactive. It has a low melting point for its neighborhood on the periodic table, and it can exist in multiple forms with different properties. You got it. Neptunium is already shaping up to be much more complex than I anticipated. It's definitely got a lot going on. But now I want to go back in time. Okay. The discovery of Neptunium. All right. It's a story filled with near misses and scientific sleuthing. It really is. We're talking the early 1900s, a time when scientists were still grappling with the very structure of the atom. Back then, the idea of elements beyond uranium was mind-boggling to many. Yeah, I can only imagine. It was like trying to imagine a color you've never seen before. Totally. But we have to thank this guy, Enrico Fermi, for shaking things up. Oh, yes, Enrico Fermi. This brilliant scientist was bombarding uranium with neutrons. Right. Thinking he'd created element 93. He was on the right track. Turns out he was on the brink of an even bigger discovery. Nuclear fission. Nuclear fission. That's like a huge deal. Absolutely. It was a turning point in science. So Fermi's work showed that the atom wasn't this impenetrable sphere. Right. It could be split. And when it split, what happened? It released an unbelievable amount of energy. It was like a tiny, incredibly powerful explosion. Talk about a scientific plot twist. I know, right? So Neptunium remained elusive. For a little while longer. But the story doesn't end there. It doesn't. Another team, a Japanese team no less, was hot on the trail right before World War II. That's right. And what's so fascinating is that what stopped them is a classic example of how science progresses. Absolutely. Their instruments, their tools of the trade, limited what they could observe. So they were almost there. They were so close to isolating Neptunium. Wow. They had the right ideas. But they just couldn't see it. Exactly. It's amazing to think how much our scientific instruments have advanced since then. It's remarkable, isn't it? I mean, you were right there on the cusp of this major discovery, but their tools just weren't quite up to the task. It happens all the time in science. Really? Oh, yeah. Wow. We're always pushing the limits of what we can observe. So what about Neptunium? Well, in 1940, Macmillan and Abelson at Berkeley, they finally succeeded in identifying Neptunium. So they had better tools? Well, partly. Okay. But it was also a bit of luck. Oh. The particular isotope of Neptunium they were working with, Neptunium-239, it had a shorter half-life. So it decayed faster. Exactly, making it easier to detect. Wow. So a mix of serendipity and ingenuity. The hallmarks of so many scientific breakthroughs. You said it. But here's the question that's been on my mind. Why should we, in the year 2024, care about Neptunium? You know... It's not exactly something we encounter in our daily lives. That's a great question, and one we'll get to right after the break. Stick with us. It's not something you're going to find in your kitchen cupboard. Right. But there's a whole other layer to why it's important. Scientifically speaking... I'm listening. These transuranic elements, the ones beyond uranium, they can act like little windows into extreme environments. Extreme environments? Yeah, like the heart of stars or the depths of planets. So you're saying by studying Neptunium, we're essentially studying remnants of stars. Exactly. Wow. By understanding how these elements behave, we can gain insights into what happens in those extreme conditions. It's like having a tiny piece of a supernova right here in the lab. That's a great way to put it. Okay, so this seemingly obscure element has implications for understanding the evolution of the universe. Did we live? That's mind-blowing. Back to Earth for a moment. You mentioned that we don't really encounter Neptunium in our daily lives. Is that entirely true? Well, let's talk about Neptunium-237. Okay. It's a byproduct of nuclear reactors, which means we've unintentionally made a lot of it since the 1940s. Okay. And here's the kicker. I'm ready. This stuff hangs around for a very long time. Millions of years. Millions of years. It's not going anywhere anytime soon. So a bit of a waste disposal headache, then. It definitely poses challenges, but what's fascinating is that Neptunium-237 is also the key ingredient for creating another isotope. Oh, really? Plutonium-238. Plutonium. That's the stuff that's used in nuclear weapons, right? That's true for some isotopes of plutonium, yes. But plutonium-238 is a different story. Okay. It's an incredibly useful and reliable power source for spacecraft. Wait, really? Yeah. The stuff that powers the Voyager probes? Exactly. That's connected to Neptunium. Precisely. Wow. Those deep space missions, they rely on plutonium-238, which we wouldn't have without Neptunium. That's incredible to think that Neptunium, this element I barely knew existed until today, played a part in making that possible. It really highlights the interconnectedness of the periodic table. Yeah, you're right. Each element has its own story, its own set of properties, and often these surprising links to our world and beyond. Absolutely. And speaking of surprises... What is it? Our sources dug up some fascinating bonus round trivia about Neptunium.
