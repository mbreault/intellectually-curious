## Transcript

Welcome back to our deep dive into the world of mathematics. We're continuing our series and today we are going to be focusing on something very special. Indeed, the 2025 Abel Prize being awarded to Masaki Kashiwara. It's a big deal, right? I mean it's basically the Nobel Prize of math. For sure, the Abel Prize is a huge recognition in mathematics. It's like the Nobel Prize and signifies incredible achievement in math. Professor Kashiwara has made significant contributions to the field so it is a truly remarkable and deserved honor. And the area he's being recognized for is algebraic analysis, which, you know, for those of us who aren't mathematicians that might sound a bit abstract, maybe even a little intimidating. But from what I've gathered, it's like this incredibly powerful way of thinking, you know, almost a master key to unlock a whole bunch of mathematical problems. Yeah, it's a very powerful area of math that Professor Kashiwara helped pioneer by essentially merging two different fields. The abstract structures of algebra with the more, I guess you could say, fluid and continuous world of analysis. Okay, so we are talking about combining the ideas of change and evolving systems with the fixed structures of algebra. What kinds of problems can this help solve and why is this so groundbreaking? Well, you see, traditional analysis is all about change. It's about things like calculus, differential equations, things that evolve over time. Algebra, on the other hand, it deals with like fixed structures, you know, symbols and how you can manipulate them. And what algebraic analysis does is it brings these two, you know, seemingly distinct worlds together. And it gives us new tools to look at problems that were previously very difficult to solve, not only within mathematics itself, but also in how we apply math to the natural world. So in things like physics and engineering. That's what I find so compelling about this whole topic. And that's exactly what we wanted to explore in this deep dive. We've been looking at a bunch of different sources, news reports, academic perspectives, and our goal today is to really grasp what algebraic analysis is all about and understand why Professor Kashiwara's work is considered so important. So where should we begin? What kind of sparked this whole intellectual journey? Well, like with many great mathematicians, it's always fascinating to look back at what initially inspired them. And for Professor Kashiwara, it seems like it all started with something pretty traditional. Japanese puzzles called Sudoku, you know, those crane and turtle puzzles. I do remember those from our prep. For our listeners who might not be familiar, could you explain what they are? Sure. Basically, they're word problems, you know, disguised as these little puzzles that involve solving a system of linear equations. So imagine, for example, you're told that there's a group of cranes and turtles, right? And, you know, the total number of heads they have and the total number of legs. Okay, I see, I see. And the challenge is to figure out how many cranes and how many turtles there are. Exactly, exactly. And, you know, a crane has one head and two legs, while a turtle has one head and four legs. Right, right. So if you had, let's say, a total of 16 legs and five heads, how would you solve that? Well, in that case, you would use a system of two equations with two unknowns. If we let k represent the number of cranes and s the number of turtles, and we're giving y total legs and x total heads, then we have these two equations. 2k plus 4 is equal to y and k plus s equals x. Now plugging in the numbers from your example, 16 legs and five heads, we get 2k plus 4 is equal to 16 and k plus s equals 5. Solving the system of equations, we find out that there are two cranes and three turtles. So it's like a fun little brain teaser, but with a solid mathematical foundation. And I can see how that would spark someone's interest in math. But how do you go from these puzzles to something as advanced as algebraic analysis? Well, the key here seems to be that Professor Kashiwara wasn't just content with, you know, finding the answer to a specific puzzle. What really fascinated him was figuring out how to generalize the problem. He enjoyed taking a step back, seeing those underlying algebraic structures, and asking himself, what happens if we change the rules or if we make it more complex? That kind of thinking moving beyond the specific to the general, that's often where significant mathematical breakthroughs happen. It's like seeing the forest for the trees. It's about abstracting those general principles from specific examples. So now let's fast forward to the 1970s. What was happening in math at that time? How did algebraic analysis emerge? Well, back in the 1970s, analysis and algebra were like two separate branches of math. They had their own tools and their own ways of thinking. Analysis was focused on continuous functions, limits, differential equations, basically describing how things change. Algebra, on the other hand, it dealt with more abstract structures like groups, rings, and fields. So two important areas of math, but they were kind of siloed, weren't they? Not really interacting much. Yeah, you could say that. However, some really important things were happening that started bridging this gap. And a key figure in this was Mikio Sato. In the late 1950s, Sato did some truly groundbreaking work on something called hyperfunction theory. It was a major departure from the way people were thinking about functional analysis at the time. Sato cleverly used sheaf theory and complex analysis to define these generalized functions, which we now call hyperfunctions. Okay, I think we might need to pause here for a second. Sheaf theory might be a new term for some of our listeners. Can you break that down for us? Okay, so imagine you're trying to study a complicated landscape, like a mountain range. You don't try to grasp the whole thing at once, do you? You might look at smaller patches, you know, individual slopes and valleys. Sheaf theory is like that. It helps us understand global properties of these landscapes by piecing together information from those smaller local patches. It makes sure that everything fits together consistently. In math, this is really powerful for studying how functions behave, especially when they're defined on complicated spaces. So it's a way to study those local behaviors and how they determine the overall picture. Exactly. And Sato's big idea was to use this framework, along with complex analysis, to define these new objects, the hyperfunctions, which are like these super-powered functions that can deal with singularities and all sorts of crazy behavior. So essentially, Sato was building this bridge between analysis and algebra using these more abstract tools from sheaf theory and complex analysis. That's exactly it. And Professor Kashiwara recognized the significance of this. He saw the potential in this new way of thinking. And so he became a student of Sato and really devoted himself to exploring this emerging field, which we now call algebraic analysis. It's about applying algebraic techniques to those objects that we study in analysis. You could even think of it as a way to geometrize analysis. Algebraic geometrization of analysis. Okay, that sounds pretty deep. What does that actually mean in practice? How does it change the way mathematicians approach problems? So imagine you're trying to study a differential equation, you know, those equations that describe how something changes over time. In traditional analysis, you might try to solve that equation directly, focusing on the individual solution. But with algebraic analysis, the perspective changes. You step back and consider the whole system of differential equations or even the differential operators themselves as a single algebraic object. You try to understand the structure of that object, much like you would study a geometric shape by looking at the equations that define it. And by understanding that structure, you gain insight into the behavior of all the solutions, even without explicitly solving the equations. Okay, that's a really fundamental shift in how we think about the problem. You're not just looking for individual answers, but understanding the underlying structure of the entire system. And I guess this is where Professor Kashiwara's work with D modules comes in. Exactly. D modules are like those algebraic objects that Kashiwara brought to the table. They're specifically modules over a ring of differential operators. And he introduced them as this really powerful tool to study things in analysis, especially those tricky differential equations. So again, it's about using these algebraic tools to study analytical things, right? Think about it. A differential equation describes a relationship between a function and its derivatives. Now, a D module, it captures that entire relationship in this algebraic form. You're not just looking for solutions anymore. You're studying the equation itself as an object. And that reveals all sorts of hidden information about the solutions, like whether they have singularities, you know, those points where they blow up to infinity, and even how many solutions you can expect to find. So it's like a more holistic way of understanding differential equations. You get a broader perspective and deeper insights. And how influential was this work? Hugely influential. In fact, his master's thesis, which he wrote back in 1970, laid the whole foundation for the analytic theory of D modules. Professor Pierre Shapira, who collaborated with Kashiwara, has said that between 1970 and 1980, Kashiwara essentially solved almost every fundamental question related to D modules. Wow. Almost all of them in a decade. That's just remarkable. But his thesis was initially written in Japanese, right? Yeah, it was originally in Japanese and wasn't translated into English until 1995. So it might have taken a while for its full impact to be felt internationally, but it was clearly a groundbreaking piece of work. Okay, now we have to talk about
