## Transcript

Welcome back, everybody, for another deep dive. This time, we're going to be tackling something called primitive permutation groups. Oh, those are fun. Yeah, they're pretty cool. And before you know, your eyes glaze over, and you're like, what is this? I promise it's way more interesting than it sounds. It is. It's really cool. So we've got some excerpts today from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Ooh! That's entry A000000. No years for those of you who are, you know, hardcore OIS fans. Yeah, if you know, you know. If you know, you know. That's right. And we've also got the Wikipedia page on primitive permutation groups. That's a good one. Yeah. So that's a great place to start. Yeah, it is a great place to start. And it's kind of like a mathematical mystery novel. That's a good way to put it. Yeah, where we're trying to uncover the secrets of these special groups. So to crack the case, I guess we need to start with the basics. What exactly is a permutation group? So a permutation group is... Well, first you have to know what a permutation is. And that's just like... If you think about rearranging a deck of cards. So every time you shuffle a deck of cards, that's a permutation. So it's a specific way of reordering things. Okay. And a permutation group is just a set of permutations that follow specific rules. Okay, so like maybe their rule is they can only swap like two cards at a time or something. Exactly. Yeah, so the rules determine which permutations are allowed in the group. And then within permutation groups, you have some that are called transitive. And that means no matter what order your deck of cards is in, there is a set of permutations that are allowed in that group that can get you back to the original order or any other order. Oh, okay. So every single arrangement of the deck of cards can be obtained by another one using the shuffles that are allowed in that group. So it's like no matter how messed up the deck is, if our group is transitive, there's a sequence of legal shuffles that can get it back in order. Exactly. Now primitive permutation groups are a little bit more specific. So they are transitive, but they also don't preserve any non-trivial partitions of the set. Hold on, partitions. Is this where things start getting messy? It can be a little messy, but think about it this way. You're dividing a pizza into slices. Okay. Okay, so each slice of pizza represents a subset of our set of objects. So in this case, the cards. Okay. So a primitive group's shuffles would totally scramble those slices. Like you wouldn't be able to tell where one slice ended and another began. Ah, I see. So like those fancy pizza places that cut the pizza in like weird asymmetrical shapes. Exactly, yeah. Okay. With an primitive group, on the other hand, the slices would stay intact even if like their positions changed. Okay. So you're just swapping two slices without cutting them up further. Gotcha. So like you're saying the Wikipedia article gives the example of the symmetric group S4 acting on the set 1, 2, 3, 4. Right. And it preserves the partition 1, 3, and 2, 4. Yeah, so you can cycle those numbers all you want, but you're always going to have 1 and 3 together and 2 and 4 together. Okay, those pairings remain unbroken. Okay, so we've got our pizza slicing analogy to understand the difference between primitive and imprimitive groups. But why should we care about this distinction? What makes primitive groups so special? Well, one of the reasons that they're so fascinating is because of a theorem by this really brilliant mathematician named Everest Galois, who unfortunately died very young. But he was a brilliant guy. He actually introduced the term primitive in his last letter before he died. Wow, talk about dramatic. I know, right? So what did his theorem say? So Galois' theorem states that if a solvable group acts primitively on a set, the size of that set must be a power of a prime number. Okay, solvable group. That sounds like a whole other mystery we need to solve. Yeah, so a solvable group is a group that can be broken down into simpler pieces in a certain way. But what's amazing about Galois' theorem is that it tells us something about primitive groups. So if we can prove a group is solvable and it's acting primitively, we know that the size of the set that it's acting on has to be a power of a prime number. So it's like a mathematical constraint on these pizza slicing groups. Exactly. And what's really cool is that we can use this theorem to prove that certain groups can't be solvable. So, for example, let's look at the symmetric group of degree 5. So that's like all the different ways to rearrange 5 objects. The order of that group is 5 factorial, which is 120. Okay, so 120 is a pretty big number. How does that relate to Galois' theorem? So if that group were solvable and it was acting primitively on a set, the size of that set would have to be a power of a prime number. And a 120 is not a power of a prime number. It's not. The prime factorization is 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 times 5. Right, so it's got multiple different primes in it. Exactly. So it can't be expressed as a single prime number raised to a power. Right. Which means, thanks to Galois' theorem, that the symmetric group of degree 5 can't be solvable. Exactly. That's the power of this theorem is that it lets us rule out possibilities and really understand the structure of groups. Wow. I'm starting to see why these primitive permutation groups are causing such a stir in the math world. Yeah. It's amazing how this seemingly simple concept, like rearranging things, can lead to these profound insights. Yeah. But I am curious about that OEIS sequence you mentioned earlier. Yeah. What does that tell us about these groups? So that's where things get really interesting. Okay. The OEIS sequence A000000 length, it lists the number of primitive permutation groups for each degree. Okay. And it reveals some fascinating patterns and some unexpected jumps. Ooh, I love patterns. So let's explore those in the next part of our deep dive. Stay tuned, folks, because things are about to get really wild. I can't wait. All right. So we're back and ready to delve into that OEIS sequence. A000000 is on it for those keeping score at home. You said that this sequence lists the number of primitive permutation groups for each degree. Right. What does that actually look like? All right. So picture a chart where each row represents a degree. So that just means the size of the set that we're rearranging. So degree 2 would be like rearranging two coins. Degree 3 would be like shuffling three cards. Right. So on. And then for each row, we just write down how many different primitive permutation groups there are for that degree. So it's kind of like a catalog of all the unique ways to do that fancy pizza slicing. Exactly. We were talking about earlier for different numbers of slices. Exactly. Okay. And so what does this list actually look like? What are the numbers? So for the first few degrees, the numbers are pretty small and they seem almost random. So like degree 2 has one primitive permutation group. Okay. Degree 3 has 2. Okay. Degree 4 also has 2. Then it jumps to 5 for degree 5. Okay. So not exactly a clear pattern emerging yet. No, not yet. But then... But you mentioned some unexpected jumps. Yeah. So when we get to degree 16, the number of primitive permutation groups jumps to 22. Whoa. 22. That's a huge leap. Why 16? What's so special about 16 that there's suddenly so many ways to like primitively rearrange things? So it turns out that a lot of these groups are hiding within something called the affine group. Okay. In four-dimensional space. Four-dimensional space. Over a field with two elements. Okay. I think we need to like slow down for a second here. Sure. Four-dimensional space, that sounds like something straight out of like science fiction. Yeah. And then what's this about a field with two elements? I'm getting flashbacks to high school math class. I'm a little lost. Okay. So think about it this way. You're used to thinking about representing points on a line. Right. Which is one-dimensional space or on a plane, which is two-dimensional space. Right. Four-dimensional space is just an extension of that concept. Okay. Even though it's hard to visualize. Yeah. But you can do it mathematically. Okay. So like if our coins or cards or whatever were actually like floating around in this four-dimensional space, the affine group would be like all the ways we could move them around while keeping certain relationships intact. Exactly. It's like our transitive groups. Okay. But in a much more complicated space. Okay. And the field with two elements just means that we're working with a very basic number system where we only have zero and one. Okay. And it might seem strange. Yeah. But these things called finite fields are really important in math and also in computer science. Okay. So we've got these primitive permutation groups like hiding out in four-dimensional space, which is already pretty mind-blowing. Yeah. What's the connection back to our OEIS sequence? So the fact that so many of these degree 16 groups are subgroups of this affine group explains why there's a sudden jump in the
