A deep dive into the mysterious metalloid antimony: from ancient cosmetics and alchemical mystique to battlefield alloys, wartime mining in Alaska, and the high-tech world of today. Explore why a once-poisonous substance was revered for centuries, and how it fuels the gadgets we canâ€™t live without.

## Transcript

Okay, get this. For centuries, people were using a toxic element for both medicine and makeup. Yeah, antimony. Antimony, right. Talk about a beauty secret with a risky side. A little bit. Today we're going deep on antimony. All right. It's this lustrous gray metalloid, so kind of a hybrid between a metal and a non-metal. Right in between. We'll journey from its ancient origins through alchemy and even touch on modern mining right here in Alaska. Sounds good. It really is fascinating. You know, what was once seen as this magical cure-all is now crucial for the tech gadgets we use every day. Totally. So antimony, we find it naturally as a mineral called stibnite, and the use of this stuff goes way back. Oh yeah, we're talking ancient Egypt, think like 3100 BC. Wow. They were grinding up stibnite to make kohl eyeliner. Really? Yeah, they thought it protected their eyes from that harsh sun. Interesting. And it's even mentioned in some biblical texts. Wait, so they were putting something toxic that close to their eyes? Well, yeah. I mean, you'd think they would figure out that wasn't the best idea. I guess it really highlights how different their understanding of medicine was back then. Makes sense. And the Egyptians weren't alone in this either. The Greeks and Romans used it too. They did? Oh yeah, for all sorts of ailments. Digestive issues, skin problems, you name it. They thought antimony could fix it. They thought it had all these amazing healing properties. So they were basically using a poison as medicine. Pretty much. Was there logic that a little bit of bad could drive out something worse? Yeah, something like that. And here's where it gets really interesting. Archaeologists found a vase in modern-day Iraq. And guess what? It's supposedly made of antimony and dates back to around 3000 BC. A vase made of antimony? Hold on, isn't antimony brittle? I mean, how could they shape it into a vase thousands of years ago? That's the mystery. Yeah. It really suggests that ancient civilizations, you know, they might have had some pretty advanced metalworking techniques that we just haven't rediscovered. That's mind-blowing. Makes you wonder what other secrets about antimony are still out there just waiting to be found. Absolutely. And that sense of mystery, it only deepens as we get into the medieval period. Ah, the medieval period. Time for alchemy. Exactly. The quest to turn lead into gold, make elixirs of life, all that. So where does antimony fit into all of that? Oh, alchemists were captivated by antimony. Were they? Oh yeah, they thought it was this powerful, almost mystical substance. Yeah. Capable of, you know, purifying and enhancing other materials. I mean, it makes sense. Back then, they didn't have the scientific method as we know it. So they were working with a lot of observation and intuition. Right. And it was all very secretive, too. Oh yeah, lots of secrets. And I think antimony's reputation, you know, the whole potential cure and poison thing, probably fueled their fascination even more. For sure. Speaking of, what's the story behind the name antimony itself? Well, there's this popular story, probably not true, but it says it comes from antimonacos, which means monk killer in Greek. Monk killer. Did antimony have it out for medieval monks or something? No, no, not quite. Okay. It's just that a lot of early alchemists were monks. And experimenting with something as toxic as antimony, well, let's just say it didn't always end well. So basically, a few too many lab accidents in the name of science. You could say that. But the name more likely comes from the Greek antimonos, which means opposed to solitude. Opposed to solitude. Yeah, because antimony is rarely found alone in nature. It's always hanging out with other elements forming compounds. Okay, so maybe not a monk killer, but definitely not a solo act. But hold on, if people were using it for centuries, when did it actually become officially recognized as an element? Well, that didn't happen until 1789. Oh, wow, really? Yeah, when the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier finally gave it its due. Okay. And then it didn't even get a spot on the periodic table until 1869. Talk about a late bloomer. But even after all that, people still kept using it for medicine, didn't they? For quite a while. They did, yeah. And that's the thing about antimony. It's this double-edged sword. How so? Well, one of its effects, even in small doses, is that it makes you vomit. Yikes. Not exactly a selling point. True. But for centuries, that was actually seen as a good thing. Really? Oh, yeah. Doctors believed that making someone throw up cleansed the body and got rid of disease. So they used a poison to treat illness. It might sound crazy now, but back then, it was all about purging the body. People thought that was the key to health. Huh. It's fascinating how perspectives change, right? It really is. It's like the medieval version of those detox cleanses everyone's into these days. Exactly. Just, you know, way more dangerous. Way more dangerous. Right. But that's how scientific knowledge works. Today's cure is tomorrow's â€“ well, you know, maybe not poison, but definitely not the go-to solution. Right. And antimony. Well, antimony is the perfect example of that. Totally. So it went from eye makeup to a medicine that made you vomit. Yep. What else could be in store for this element? Oh, just wait. Antimony was about to go from the medicine cabinet to the battlefield. Whoa, hold on. How did that happen? Well, the Industrial Revolution, you know, created a huge demand for new materials and new technologies. And antimony, with its ability to harden other metals, what suddenly became crucial for warfare. That's quite a change from medicine to warfare. It is. And that's where antimony's story really starts to get tied to the US. Oh. Especially to Alaska. Okay, I'm intrigued. But we'll have to save that part of the story for next time. All right, sounds good. So before we got sidetracked, we were talking about antimony's wild ride, you know, from ancient medicine to the battlefield. Yeah. How did this seemingly humble element become so important in warfare? Well, it all starts with shrapnel shells. You might have heard of them. I think so. A British military man, Major General Henry Shrapnel, he developed them back in the 1780s. Okay. Imagine this, like a cannonball packed with musket balls, designed to explode midair and just shower the enemy with deadly projectiles. Ouch. Sounds pretty effective, though. Yeah, it really was a game changer when it came to, like, artillery tactics. And antimony, well, antimony played a pretty crucial role. Oh, so? When you combine antimony and lead, you create an alloy that's, like, way tougher and stronger than lead alone. So these musket balls inside the shrapnel shells, they were made with this lead-antimony alloy. Exactly. The antimony made sure that the projectiles could hold their shape and, you know, really pack a punch. Gotcha. And this innovation, well, it spread pretty quickly. By the early 1800s, shrapnel shells were standard military equipment all over the world. So even before the World Wars, antimony was already being recognized as a strategically valuable material. Absolutely. So you can imagine when World War I broke out, the demand for antimony just skyrocketed. Yeah, I bet. Every major power suddenly needed huge amounts of ammunition. And that meant antimony for those lead alloys. It's like antimony went from a supporting role to, like, the lead actor practically overnight. Yeah, great way to put it. And then, you know, with overseas supplies becoming unreliable during the war, the U.S. started looking for sources of antimony within its own borders. Enter Alaska. Precisely. Turns out Alaska has pretty substantial deposits of stibnite, you know, the mineral antimony comes from. Right. So with this wartime demand and everything, mining activity in Alaska exploded, especially in the interior and western regions. So we're talking, like, actual antimony mines popping up all over Alaska. Yeah. Mines like the Scrafford Mine, it was near Fairbanks. Okay. And the Sleskovich Mine near Nome, they became big players. Wow. And there were others, too, in the Kuskokwim region. The U.S. government even started, like, offering incentives, encouraging war production. It's amazing how a global conflict can reshape an entire industry. It is. And even a region, you know, like Alaska. It really is. It reminds you of how interconnected the world is. Yeah. And it's not just about the physical resource itself, but the, you know, the knowledge and expertise that develops around it. Totally. So Alaska did its part, you know, supplying antimony for the war effort. What happened after the war ended? Did the mines just shut down? Well, a lot of them did, yeah. The immediate demand for antimony dropped off after the war. Makes sense. And attention shifted to other materials. Plastics were becoming more commonplace. And the electronics industry was starting to take off. So antimony kind of took a back seat for a while. Yeah, you could say that. Yeah. But it wasn't the end of antimony's story.
