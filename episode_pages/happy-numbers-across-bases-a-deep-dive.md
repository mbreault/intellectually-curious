## Description

We explore the simple rule of summing squares of digits and how iterating it reveals happy numbers in base 10 and beyond. Formalizing with f_{2,b}(n), we trace examples like 13 and 4, examine cycles, and discuss arithmetic dynamics across bases. We'll see why there are infinitely many happy numbers in any base, how density behaves without settling to a single value, and what makes bases like 2 and 4 ‚Äúhappy‚Äù and others like 6 exhibit cycles. We‚Äôll also touch on open questions about which bases are completely happy and the nature of the resulting cycles.

## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today we're diving into a really quite fun area of number theory. Happy numbers. It sounds cheerful, doesn't it? It does. So what's the basic idea here? Well, a happy number is essentially a positive integer, where if you repeatedly sum the squares of its digits. Okay, square the digits, add them up. Exactly. And you keep doing that with the result. If you eventually land on the number one, the original number is called happy. Okay, give me an example, like 13. 13 is perfect. So 1 squared is 1, 3 squared is 9. Add them. 1 plus 9 is 10. Right, now repeat. 1 squared is 1, 0 squared is 0. Add those. 1 plus 0 is 1. We hit 1. So 13 is happy, yes. But not all numbers are like that, right? What about, say, 4? Good counterexample, let's try 4. 4 squared is 16. Okay, now 1 squared is 1, 6 squared is 36. No, wait, 36. So 1 plus 36 is 37. Correct, keep going. 3 squared is 9, 7 squared is 49. 9 plus 49 is 58. 5 squared is 25, 8 squared is 64. 25 plus 64 is 89. Now we keep going. 8 squared plus 9 squared is 64 plus 81. That's 145. Then 1 squared plus 4 squared plus 5 squared. 1 plus 16 plus 25 equals 42. Almost there. 4 squared plus 2 squared is 16 plus 4, which is 20. And finally, 2 squared plus 0 squared is 4 plus 0, which is 4. We're back where we started. Exactly, it falls into a cycle. 4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42, 20, and back to 4. It never reaches 1. So 4 is unhappy. Unhappy, or sometimes called sad, yes. It seems like a simple game, but it actually connects to some deeper mathematical ideas. Right, you mentioned arithmetic dynamics. It's about how numbers change when you keep applying a rule. Precisely, we're iterating a function. In this deep dive, we'll explore this not just in our familiar base 10, but other bases too, and even look at happy primes. Okay, let's get a bit more formal. This rule squaring digits and summing them, how do mathematicians write that down? We use a function often denoted f sub p, b of n, f sub b sub n. Whoa, okay, break that down. Sure. n is the number we start with, b is the number base, like base 10 or base 6, and p is the power we raise the digits to. For happy numbers, we're squaring, so p is 2. So for our standard happy numbers, it's f sub 2010 sub... Exactly, f sub 2, 10 of n. And we say n is b happy if applying this function repeatedly, maybe j times. Like f sub 2 b sub applied j times. Yes, sometimes written f sub 2 sub sub sub n, if that eventually equals 1. Got it. So our earlier example, 19, 1 squared plus 9 squared is 82, that's f sub 2010 sub 19. Right, and f sub 2010 sub 82 is 68, f sub 2010 sub 68 is 100, and f sub 2010 sub 100 is 1. So 19 is 10 happy. Okay, and this works in other bases too, you mentioned base 6. It does. Let's take a number, say 347 in our usual base 10. Okay. In base 6, that number is written as 3035, so 1335 base 6. Right, because base 6 uses powers of 6. 12 squared plus 336 plus 36 plus 51, that's 216 plus 108 plus 18 plus 5 plus 347. Add those up, 1 plus 9 plus 9 plus 25 equals 44, that's in base 10. Correct. Now what's 44 in base 6? It's 13616 and 2 ones, so 112 base 6. Okay, 112 base 6, repeat the process. Digits are 1, 1, 2, square them. 1 squared, 1 squared, 2 squared, that's 1, 1, 4. Sum is 1 plus 1 plus 4 equals 6. Base 10 again? And 6 in base 10 is written as 10 in base 6, 1, 6, and 0 ones. Ah, okay, last step. Digits 1, 0, square them. 1 squared is 1, 0 squared is 0, sum is 1. We reached 1. So 347 in base 10 is 6 happy. That's right, or you could say 1335 base 6 is 6 happy. The process is the same. That's really cool. So are happy numbers, like, common or rare? Well, in any base greater than 1, there are actually infinitely many happy numbers. Infinitely many. How do we know that? Because 1 itself is always happy, right? 1 squared is 1. And also, any power of the base is happy. Like 10, 100,000 in base 10. Exactly. 1 squared plus 0 squared is 1. 1 squared plus 0 squared plus 0 squared is 1. They all go straight to 1. Oh, and adding zeros doesn't change things, does it? Because 0 squared is 0. Precisely. If 7 is happy, then 70 is happy, 700 is happy, 7,000 is happy. Because 7 squared plus 0 squared is the same as 7 squared. Okay, so there are infinitely many. But what about their density? If I just pick a random number in base 10, what are the chances it's happy? That's a much trickier question, actually. If you look at, say, the first million integers, the proportion that are happy is around 15%, about 0.15. This is often called the natural density. So about 1 in 7 numbers. Roughly, yes. But here's the really surprising part. It's been proven that 10 happy numbers don't have an asymptotic density. What does that mean exactly? No asymptotic density. It means that the percentage doesn't settle down to one specific value as you look at larger and larger ranges of numbers. It keeps fluctuating. Really? It doesn't converge. No. We know the density is always somewhere between about 0.113 and 0.184, roughly 11% and 19%. But it never picks a single number to approach. It just keeps wobbling between those bounds. That is deeply weird. Why would that happen? It likely has to do with the somewhat irregular way numbers fall into that path towards 1. It's not evenly distributed enough for the density to stabilize. It's one of those areas where simple rules create complex, slightly unpredictable behavior. Fascinating. Okay, you also mentioned happy bases. What's that? A happy base is a base b where every single positive integer is b happy. Every number eventually goes to 1. Yes, every number. It's a very strong condition. And figuring out which bases are happy is actually an unsolved problem in mathematics. An unsolved problem from this simple idea. Indeed. What we know is limited. The only integer bases less than 500 million that have been found to be happy are base 2 and base 4. Just 2. Binary and base 4. Out of half a billion. As far as we know, yes. Why base 4, for instance? What makes it special? In base 4, if you look at the numbers you can get by summing squares of digits, the only number n where f sub 2004 sub n is the number 1 itself. It's the only positive fixed point. And crucially, there are no cycles either. In base 4, no matter what number you start with, if you repeatedly apply the sum of squares of digits rule, you are guaranteed to eventually hit 1. There's nowhere else for the process to go long term. So no unhappy cycles like the one we saw with 4 and base 10. Correct. Every number is what's called a pre-periodic point for 1. It eventually leads to 1. That makes sense. So for bases that aren't happy, like base 6 or base 10, the unhappy numbers must end up in cycles. Yes, exactly. For base 6, it turns out there's only one cycle for unhappy numbers, apart from the fixed point 1. What is it? It's a cycle of 8 numbers. If you write them in base 6, they are 5, then 41, then 25, 45, 105, 42, 32, and 21, which then goes back to 5. An 8 number loop. And every unhappy base 6 number ends up there. That's right. And just like base 10, in base 6, the only positive number in is equal to the sum of the squares of its own digits. F sub 26 sub n is 1. And the base 10 cycle we found starting from 4, what were all
