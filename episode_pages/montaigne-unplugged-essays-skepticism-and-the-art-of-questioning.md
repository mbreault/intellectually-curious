A deep dive into Michel de Montaigne's revolutionary Essaysâ€”the personal, conversational voice, his Pyrrhonian skepticism, and enduring lessons on education, doubt, and the human condition. We trace his life from a Latin-immersed upbringing to the citadel of his tower and explore why 'What do I know?' still resonates today.

## Transcript

Welcome to our deep dive today, where we're going to be looking at the essays by Michel de Montaigne. This is a French Renaissance philosopher. And his work has really resonated, I mean, with thinkers all the way from Shakespeare to Emerson. Huge. So using excerpts from a couple of Wikipedia articles on Montaigne himself and his essays, we'll discover why his style was so revolutionary. And also we'll look into why his ideas about education are still relevant even today. Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much his work still resonates. I mean, he was writing, what, like almost 500 years ago now? Yeah. And yet you can pick up his essays today and it feels like you're having a conversation with a friend, you know? It's just this incredible blend of the personal and the philosophical that really makes him stand out. And his motto, what do I know? Right. I mean, that really captures his spirit. Really does. Of skepticism. Yeah, absolutely. So who is this guy? Who is this guy who decided to question everything? Well, Michel de Montaigne was born in 1533 to a pretty wealthy family. Okay. And his father, he had this really interesting approach to education. Total Latin immersion. Relax. Yeah. He actually grew up speaking only Latin with tutors and even his parents surrounded by music. So Latin was like the language of the house. Pretty much. And they even had like a dedicated musician just to keep things lively, you know, create a fun atmosphere. That's so wild. Right. I mean, it definitely shows how much his father valued a humanistic education. Yeah. But even with that super privileged upbringing, Montaigne's life had its share of challenges. Oh, I'm sure. He lived through some pretty turbulent times. I mean, the French Wars of Religion were raging. Right. And he even served as the mayor of Bordeaux during all that. Oh, wow. Trying to mediate between Catholics and Protestants. Wow. So that was... Not exactly a peaceful time to be alive. No, no. I mean, did these events that he lived through, did they have any impact on his writing at all? Absolutely. I think the chaos of the world around him, it probably fueled his introspective nature. Okay. And then there was a real turning point in his life. What was that? It was the death of his closest friend. Oh, wow. Etienne de LaBouty. Okay. Montaigne was devastated. And at 38 years old, he decided to retreat to his tower library. Oh, wow. For almost a decade. Wow. He called it his citadel. That's interesting you say that, citadel. Because it seems like he was seeking refuge. Right. But also maybe building something new at the same time. Exactly. It was during this period of deep reading and introspection that he started writing his essays. And they were groundbreaking for their time. Oh, absolutely. Imagine like personal anecdotes about his life, all mixed in with philosophical insights and quotes from ancient authors. He sounds like... It's just this amazing blend. The kind of friend who can connect the history of, you know, forks to the meaning of life. You got it. It's this unique mix of the personal and the philosophical that makes his work so fascinating, even today. Yeah. So, speaking of the philosophical, what were some of the big themes that he explored in his essays? Yeah. What were some of those? Well, his skepticism, that's like the foundation. Remember his famous, what do I know? Right. Well, that wasn't just a catchy phrase. Oh, I see. He was really influenced by Pyrrhonism. Okay. Which is a whole school of thought that really emphasizes the limits of human knowledge. It led him to constantly question assumptions. So even things that we think are common sense. Even those, yeah. Okay. He was basically saying, don't believe everything you think. That's a pretty radical idea, especially for the 16th century. Oh, absolutely. Especially when you think about how powerful religious dogma was back then. Right. But Montaigne, he wasn't afraid to challenge the status quo. So he challenged like societal norms. He questioned societal norms, yeah. Okay. He critiqued institutions. He even challenged the very idea of passionate love. Really? He saw it as like a potential threat to individual freedom. So instead of blindly following convention, he prioritized reason and individual experience. Exactly. And that's where his ideas about education get really interesting. In his essay on the education of children, he totally rejected rote learning. Like memorization without understanding. Exactly. Which was, you know, super common back then. Right, right. He argued that true learning, it comes from experience. From questioning, from making connections, and fostering curiosity in students. It sounds like he was way ahead of his time. Yeah. I mean, those are the principles behind a lot of the progressive education movements. Absolutely. And it wasn't just about children either, Montaigne. He believed that learning should be a lifelong pursuit. Oh, wow. A way of constantly engaging with the world and expanding our understanding of ourselves and others. So we've got this foundation of skepticism. A rejection of blind faith in authority. And this real emphasis on experiential learning. Yeah. So how did all of that come together in his essays? Well... Did his style of writing kind of reflect those ideas at all? Absolutely. What's really interesting is that he actually wrote the essays in three distinct phases. Oh, okay. So he was constantly adding, revising, refining his thoughts over time. So the essays themselves are kind of a testament to his belief in lifelong learning. Exactly. It's like you can see his thinking evolving on the page. I like that. But what about his contemporaries, right? Yeah. What did they think? Were they scandalized by all this? Well, it's interesting because while he was challenging a lot of conventions, he wasn't trying to just like tear everything down, you know? Yeah. His skepticism was more about seeking understanding, not promoting cynicism. I see, I see. He was more interested in opening up new avenues of thought than just rejecting everything that came before him. That makes a lot of sense. And that's what makes him so relevant today, even now, in a world where we're just bombarded with information and conflicting viewpoints. His approach to knowledge, which is rooted in humility, curiosity, and a willingness to question, that feels incredibly valuable, don't you think? It really does. So we've gotten a sense of who Montaigne was, the historical context of his writing, and some of the core ideas that drive his work. But let's dig a little deeper into the heart of those ideas. When we come back in part two, we'll unpack his skepticism in more detail and explore how that shaped his views on human nature and the search for truth. Sounds good. Yeah. I'm looking forward to it. Welcome back to our deep dive into Michel de Montaigne's essays. Okay. Before we get into the complexities of human nature, I'd like to explore his skepticism a bit further. Okay. It's this idea that to learn, we have to admit that we don't know everything. Yeah, it's a fascinating paradox, isn't it? Right. And Montaigne's skepticism, you know, it wasn't just a philosophical stance. It was like a way of life. It was a lens through which he viewed everything. Okay. And so when he famously asked, what do I know? Yeah. It wasn't just being rhetorical. Right. He genuinely believed that true knowledge, it begins with acknowledging the limits of our understanding. So instead of clinging to certainty, he embraced doubt as a starting point. Yeah. Which seems like a very risky approach. It was, and it still is. Right. But for Montaigne, it was all about intellectual honesty. Okay. He argued that our senses can deceive us. Okay. Our reasoning can be flawed. Right. And even seemingly unshakable truths can crumble under scrutiny. So could you give me an example of how he applied this skepticism to actual, like, real life situations? He often used these really vivid historical examples to illustrate his points. Like, for instance, he wrote about this case of Martin Gair, who was a man whose identity was stolen by an imposter. Wow. And this imposter actually fooled even Gair's own wife and family. Really? Yeah, it's a crazy story. And for Montaigne, this story, it really highlighted how easily we can be deceived even by those closest to us. It makes you question everything you think you know. Yeah, exactly. It really does. So how did this skeptical outlook shape his view on, like, the pursuit of truth? Did he even think it was possible to find truth? Well, that's where his connection to Pyrrhonism comes in, which is the school of skeptical philosophy. And the Pyrrhonists, they believed that suspending judgment on matters we can't definitively prove was the key to finding peace of mind. Okay. They didn't necessarily deny the existence of truth. They just simply acknowledged the difficulty and maybe even the impossibility of us as humans grasping it fully. So it's more about recognizing our limitations than giving up on the search for truth entirely. Exactly. Did Montaigne believe that by acknowledging our fallibility, we somehow get closer to truth? I think that's a really nuanced way to put it. You know, by letting go of the need for absolute certainty. Right. We open ourselves up to different perspectives. Okay. To the possibility that we might be wrong and to the inherent complexity of the world around us. It's almost like he's saying, the more you think you know, the less you actually do. Exactly. And this ties directly into his fascination with human nature. Okay. He saw human beings as inherently contradictory. Okay. You know
