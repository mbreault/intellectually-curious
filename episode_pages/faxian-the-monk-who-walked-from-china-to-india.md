## Description

In The Deep Dive, we follow Faxian, a Chinese Buddhist monk who, around age 60, set out on foot from Changâ€™an to India and back in the late 4thâ€“early 5th century. His decade in India, his quest for a complete Vinaya, and the Sanskrit texts he gathered push the boundaries of our understanding of early Buddhism. Weâ€™ll explore his observations of Hinayana and Mahayana, his encounters with Buddhist centers from Kapilavastu to Bodh Gaya, and the lasting impact of his record, the Foguji, on Buddhist practice in East Asiaâ€”and what terminus ante quem means for dating these texts.

## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive. You're here because you want to get smart on fascinating topics without wading through endless pages. And, well, that's exactly what we do using the sources you've shared. That's right. Today we're diving headfirst into, I mean, just an incredible story of perseverance and the search for knowledge. It's the journey of a really remarkable individual. Absolutely. We're talking about Faxian. He was a Chinese Buddhist monk who, get this, at roughly 60 years old, set off on this astonishing pilgrimage. Astonishing is the word. On foot. From China all the way to India and back. This is late 4th, early 5th century. Wow. Just let that sink in for a second. Yeah. The scale of that? It's almost unimaginable today, let alone back then. Totally unimaginable. It really is mind-boggling. So yeah, this is our deep dive into Faxian, also known as Fa Yin or Fa Xian. His birth name was Gong Sihi. Our mission really is to unpack what drove him on this incredibly dangerous journey. What he actually saw in India, which he wrote down, thankfully, in his Foguji, the record of the Buddhist kingdoms. A crucial text. And look at the huge impact his whole effort had on Buddhism back in East Asia. And, you know, for historians, Faxian's Foguji is just invaluable. It gives us what's called a terminus antequem. Okay, what does that mean exactly? It's basically a historical not later than date. Think of it like this. Because Faxian describes certain things, names, events, texts, ideas in India in the early 5th century, we know those things must have existed no later than that time. It helps pin down timelines, especially for, say, the development of different Buddhist schools and philosophies. It's a fantastic anchor point. Got it. So a really important historical marker. Okay, so let's picture the scene. It's the late 390 CE. Faxian, already around 60 years old, leaves Chang'an in China. Yeah. And he doesn't get back until 412. A massive journey. And the really key part of this whole odyssey was the decade he spent immersed in India. Okay, let's dig into that first. What on earth motivates a man of, you know, 60 to attempt something so huge and risky? Well, the main driver, it seems, was his deep worry about the Vinaya collections back in Chang'an. The Vinaya. Remind us what that is. Those are the monastic rules. Basically, the code of conduct, the regulations for Buddhist monks and nuns. The sources say Faxian was really troubled that the collections they had in China were incomplete, sort of patchy. Ah, okay. So this wasn't some kind of, you know, sightseeing tour. Not at all. It was a serious mission. A scholarly spiritual quest to get the foundational texts right for proper Buddhist practice. Precisely. He needed the complete rule book, so to speak. And he didn't start out completely on his own, did he? That's right. Around late 399, maybe early 400 CE, he teamed up with four other monks, Huijing, Daojing, Huiying, and Huiwei. They all agreed to make this trek to India specifically to find more complete versions of the Vinaya. Strength in numbers, I guess. And their group actually grew. Later on, five more pilgrims joined them when they reached Zengyi. That's some serious dedication from all of them. Now, we also know a bit about his early life, which seems, well, it seems like it set him on this path very, very young. It really did. He became a novice monk at just three years old. Three? Yeah, quite extraordinary. The backstory is quite sad, actually. He lost three older brothers when they were young. Oh, no. And his father, probably terrified the same would happen to Faxian, dedicated him to the monastery, kind of like a blessing or protection. I see. Then later, when his father died, his uncle urged him, you know, come back, look after your mother. But Faxian had already made his choice. He stuck with it. He did. He apparently said he wanted to be far from the dust and vulgar ways of life. It shows a really deep personal commitment to being a monk right from early on. It wasn't just something his parents decided. That decision, especially after his father's death, really says a lot about his character, his resolve. And there's that story, too, isn't there, about the thieves. It shines a light on who he was. Oh, yeah, that's a great anecdote. So Faxian and some other young monks are out cutting rice in the fields, and these hungry thieves show up wanting to take their harvest. The other monks, understandably, panicked and ran. I probably would have, too. Right. But Faxian, he stood his ground. And instead of fighting back or resisting, he spoke to them with just remarkable compassion. Oh, what did he say? He basically acknowledged their hunger, their need right now, but also gently suggested, you know, maybe their hardship now was linked to not being generous in past lives. And he worried about their future suffering because of this theft. Bold move. Incredibly bold. And apparently the thieves were so struck by his words, his whole demeanor, that they just left the grain and walked away. No way. Yeah. The other monks were, as you can imagine, completely blown away by his courage and, well, the power of his nonviolent conviction. What an amazing story. A powerful glimpse into his character early on. Okay, so he's got this deep motivation, he's got this group, and he sets off. That first part of the journey along the Silk Road. Paint a picture for us. It must have been brutal. Oh, unbelievably tough. They were walking west from Changlin, crossing these vast, icy deserts, dealing with extreme cold, extreme heat. Just walking. Just walking. And navigating these incredibly rugged, dangerous mountain passes. The physical endurance alone. It's staggering to think about, day after day, with probably very basic supplies. Yeah, it's hard for us to even imagine the challenges. Freezing temperatures, maybe bandits, lack of water. Exactly. All of that. And this incredibly long, hard overland route eventually brought them into India, coming in from the northwest. Okay, so he makes it to India and then spends a whole decade there. A full 10 years, yes. Importantly, this was during the reign of Chandragupta II, a significant period in Indian history. And this long stay allowed him to really immerse himself, right? Visiting the key Buddhist sites. Absolutely. He made pilgrimages to the places that were, you know, directly tied to the Buddha's life and teachings, the really sacred spots. So places like Kapilavastu, which is Lumbini now, the Buddha's birthplace. Yes, that one. And Bodh Gaya, of course, where he reached enlightenment. Under the Bodhi tree. Precisely. Then Benares, or Varanasi, where he gave his first sermon. Shravasti, which was a major hub for early Buddhism. And Kushinagar, the place where the Buddha passed away, attained Parinirvana. Visiting those places must have been incredibly powerful for him. A deeply spiritual experience. You have to imagine it was transformative. But he wasn't just a pilgrim. He was also there as a scholar. Right, the original mission. The texts. Exactly. He put serious effort into learning Sanskrit. The language of the scriptures in India, then? Yes, the main language for Buddhist texts there. And he diligently searched for and collected Indian Buddhist literature. He spent time in major centers of learning like Pataliputra, that's modern Patna, and also Aurobindo and Taxila, up in the Gandhara region. It was like a massive, decade-long treasure hunt for scriptures. It really sounds like it. And his book, the Foguji, gives us this unique snapshot of Buddhism in India at that specific time, the early 5th century. It absolutely does. It's a priceless firsthand account. He talks about the different Buddhist traditions he saw. He notes the Hinayana schools, which some might know as Theravada, though that's complex. Right, the older schools. Generally, yes. And he also observes the Mahayana traditions, which were becoming increasingly influential then. So different interpretations and approaches within Buddhism coexisting. Yes, and he even mentions specific sub-traditions within the broader Theravada lineage that were around in 5th century India. His work led him to gather a really significant number of Sanskrit texts. These were the treasures he aimed to bring back to China. And his observations weren't just confined to India proper, right? He also noted Buddhist practices in Central Asia on his way there. That's a good point. Yes, he mentions places like Khotan, a major oasis city on the Silk Road. What did he see there? He described thriving Buddhist communities. He noted that the local monks deeply respected Indian manuscripts and even recited them in Indian languages. Interesting. And in Taxila too, he described a notable Buddhist community, even though he observed most people in the surrounding area followed other faiths. So it gives us a picture of Buddhism as this really widespread religion and cultural force stretching across huge areas. Definitely. And Faxian gives us these wonderful, vivid details about the religious life he witnessed, especially the big public ceremonies. Oh yeah, boy. He describes these really elaborate rituals and public festivals honoring the Buddha. And interestingly, these often had royal support, showing that Buddhism had significant patronage. So state-sponsored events almost. In some cases, yes. He talks about annual processions, particularly one on the
