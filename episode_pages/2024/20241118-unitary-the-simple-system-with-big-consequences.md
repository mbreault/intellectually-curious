## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone, for another deep dive. This time, we're going to look at a really fascinating number system. It's called Inary. Inary. You use decimal every day, and you've probably heard of binary, the language of computers, but Inary is something else. It's so simple, it almost feels like cheating. To guide us, we've got excerpts from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, that's O-L-E-I-S, and also the Wikipedia article on the Unitary Numeral System. Great. So are you ready to sort of uncover the secrets of Unitary? Absolutely. I think Unitary, you know, it might seem like child's play, like at first glance, but it's actually got surprising depth, and it pops up in some really unexpected places, especially in computer science. Okay. Let's start with the basics, then. What exactly N-S Unitary? Okay. So imagine you're back in kindergarten, and you're using tally marks to count, you know, one, two, three, four, five. That's basically Unitary in a nutshell. Okay. You're representing a number by just repeating a symbol, a single symbol, that stands for one, and you just repeat it as many times as the number you're trying to represent. So like to represent the number three, you would just write 111. It's almost too simple. So it's like you're saying 111, but just writing down the ones. Exactly. Okay. But doesn't that get ridiculously long for larger numbers? Oh, absolutely. It becomes really inefficient for representing large numbers. Yeah. But that's actually part of what makes Unitary so fascinating, because it's so basic that it can be used as a kind of stress test in computer science. A stress test? Yeah. For computers? Yeah. Think of it like this. If you want to see how efficient a car engine is, you might run it at its maximum speed for a while, right? You're kind of putting it through its paces. Well, Unitary works the same way for algorithms. Algorithms are basically just sets of instructions for computers. So by using Unitary to represent numbers, you're essentially forcing the algorithm to deal with a longer, more cumbersome input. And this helps computer scientists analyze how the algorithm performs under pressure. So it's like making the computer work harder to see if it can handle it. Exactly. But how does that actually help improve algorithms? Well, if an algorithm struggles with Unitary, which is incredibly simple, as we've seen, it might indicate that it's not very efficient overall. And this can lead computer scientists to look for ways to optimize the algorithm, make it work better, even when dealing with more complex number systems like binary or decimal. So Unitary's inefficiency actually makes it a useful tool for testing efficiency in other areas. I never would have thought of that. Yeah, it's pretty cool, right? And that's just one of Unitary's many surprises. It also plays a role in defining a category of problems that are called strongly NP-complete. Strongly NP-complete problems. Yeah. These are essentially like some of the toughest problems in computer science. Okay, you've lost me. Okay, so imagine trying to solve a giant Sudoku puzzle. But instead of having nine squares, you have like millions of squares. Oh, wow. That's the kind of complexity we're talking about here. Right. And Unitary helps define this category of problems by making it possible to compare the difficulty of solving these problems across different number systems. Because even though Unitary is simple, it helps us understand these incredibly complex computer science problems. Okay, my mind is starting to bend a little. But are computers the only place where Unitary shows up? Yeah. Beyond kindergarten tally marks? Not at all. So remember how I said it's like a stress test, right? Well, that concept can actually be applied to things beyond just algorithms. Unitary actually pops up in some pretty unexpected corners of the real world, like in data compression. Some algorithms use Unitary as part of a strategy to represent information more efficiently. Wait a minute, didn't we just say Unitary is inefficient? How can it help with compression? It's a matter of perspective. So while Unitary isn't efficient for representing large numbers directly, it can be cleverly used within more complex systems to actually achieve better overall compression. It's like using a simple Lego brick to build a surprisingly intricate structure. Okay, so Unitary can be both inefficient and efficient depending on how it's used. I'm starting to see why this seemingly basic system is so interesting. Yeah. And there's more. Unitary also has deep roots in mathematical logic. You know those basic building blocks of numbers, like how we define what one means or what addition means? Right. Well, Unitary plays a key role in something called Pino axioms, which is this set of principles that are used to define natural numbers and their properties. Pino axioms, that sounds really abstract. It is. But it shows that Unitary isn't just a cute way to count. It's fundamental to how we define numbers in the first place. Wow. So Unitary is connected to the very foundations of math. This simple system is turning out to be way more profound than I ever imagined. Right. Where else does this unexpected hero of a number system show up? Well, you might be surprised to learn that Unitary even plays a role in those pesky spam emails that we all get. Spam filters. Yeah. You're telling me Unitary is helping keep my inbox clean. How does that even work? Yeah. So some spam filters actually use a Unitary system in the email header. They use asterisks to rate how likely a message is spam. So the more stars, the higher the spam rating. It's like a visual warning system, you know, making it easier to spot and filter those unwanted messages. So even in our digital world, Unitary is still relevant. Absolutely. Who knew something as simple as repeating symbols could be so useful? Right. This deep dive has been mind-blowing. We've gone from kindergarten tally marks to complex computer science problems and even touched on spam filters. It's pretty amazing. And we haven't even begun to explore Unitary's connection to prime numbers. That's right. There's this fascinating observation in the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS, about Unitary numbers and prime numbers. It turns out that all prime numbers, except for the number two, can also be represented as a Unitary number. Hold on. Prime numbers as Unitary. Yeah. We'll have to unpack that in the next part of our deep dive. This is getting really interesting. Welcome back. So before we got sidetracked by spam filters and asterisks, we were about to explore this fascinating connection between Unitary numbers and prime numbers, which you were just telling us about. And I'm still trying to wrap my head around how something as simple as Unitary can be linked to these building blocks of numbers. Yeah, it is a pretty wild connection. The online encyclopedia of integer sequences. Oh, OEIS. Yeah, the OEIS. It points out that if you think about Unitary numbers as just strings of ones, then any prime number except for two can be written in Unitary. So you're saying that prime numbers, those numbers that are only divisible by one and themselves, can be written as a bunch of ones. But what makes that so fascinating? I mean, it seems kind of obvious. What's fascinating here is the implication. So the fact that every prime number, except for two, can be represented in Unitary suggests that the concept of primality, this fundamental property of numbers, can be expressed within this incredibly simple system. Okay, I think I'm starting to see what you mean. So even though Unitary seems basic, like on the surface, it's somehow tied to this deeper mathematical concept of prime numbers? Precisely. This connection, I think, really highlights the unexpected depth of Unitary. It's not just about, you know, tally marks or simple counting, but it actually touches on fundamental concepts in number theory, which is the study of numbers and their properties. It's like Unitary is revealing a hidden simplicity within the complexity of prime numbers, right? Yeah, that's a great way to put it. It kind of challenges our assumptions about what's simple and what's complex, and Unitary, despite its seemingly limited expressiveness, might be pointing to, like, a more fundamental truth about the nature of numbers and their relationships. This is really making me think about numbers in a whole new way. It's like we've been looking at them through a complex lens all this time, and Unitary is offering us, like, a simpler, more elegant perspective. Yeah, and that's the beauty of exploring different perspectives, right, and challenging our assumptions. It kind of opens up new possibilities for understanding and appreciating the world around us. This whole deep dive has been a journey of unexpected discoveries. Yeah. We started with, you know, those kindergarten tally marks, and we've ended up, you know, exploring profound questions about the nature of numbers and their banning blocks. It's incredible. Yeah, it is. We've seen how Unitary, despite its, you know, apparent simplicity, has this deep and lasting impact on various fields, from computer science to mathematics and even, you know, to filtering spam from our inboxes. Before we wrap up, I'm curious, you mentioned earlier how Unitary acts as, like, a stress test for algorithms. Do you think that that same concept could be applied to other systems, like other systems besides just algorithms? That's a really interesting question, and the answer is potentially yes. Remember, the idea behind using Unitary as a stress test is to see how a system performs when faced with, you know, an intentionally inefficient input. So theoretically, you could apply this concept to other systems beyond just computer algorithms. So we could use this simple system, Unitary, to analyze and understand complex systems in the real world. So think about systems like supply chains, communication networks
