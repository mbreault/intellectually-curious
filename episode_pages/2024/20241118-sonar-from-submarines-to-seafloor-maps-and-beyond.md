## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today, we're going to be diving into sonar. You know that tech that uses sound to kind of see underwater? Right. And navigate and communicate. Yeah. It's incredible how much we've learned from it. Yeah. For this deep dive, we've got excerpts from a textbook on sonar applications and also the Wikipedia article on sonar. Okay. And what we really want to figure out is how sonar evolved from its military origins to become such a vital tool in fields like fishing and navigation and even scientific research. We might even touch on how it could be used to explore oceans on other planets. So that's kind of the big picture here. I mean, it really is remarkable how sonar has kind of opened up a whole new world to us. Yeah. A world that's largely hidden from view. Right. So, okay, let's start with the basics. I think most people, when they hear sonar, they think of submarines. Yeah. But it actually has a much longer history than that. Absolutely. Right. Yeah, the earliest record we have of a sonar-like device goes all the way back to 1490. Leonardo da Vinci. Yes. Leonardo da Vinci used a tube placed in water to listen for approaching ships. I mean. Talk about a visionary. What a genius. That's wild. So when did sonar really start to take off? Like when did it become? Like a lot of technologies, its development was really accelerated by war. Okay. In the early 20th century, the threat of submarine warfare, particularly during World War I. Right. Led to the development of something called ASDAQ, which stands for Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Committee. Okay. It was a crucial step in countering the German U-boats. Sonar became like a key tool in naval warfare. Absolutely. But those early sonar systems were pretty basic. Imagine trying to attack a submarine with depth charges. Yeah. While relying on ASDAQ, the attacking ship had to pass directly over the submarine to drop the charges, which meant losing sonar contact at the worst possible moment, right before the attack. So they were essentially just firing blind. Yeah, they had to get creative to overcome that limitation. Yeah, how did they do that? One tactic they developed was the creeping attack. This involved two ships working in tandem. Okay. One would track the submarine using ASDAQ from a distance, while the other, with its sonar switched off, would sneak in between the tracking ship and the target to launch a surprise attack. That's pretty clever. But what about that like blind spot right before they attacked? Well, to address that, they developed weapons that could be launched forward. Okay. Like the Hedgehog. Instead of dropping depth charges directly overhead, the Hedgehog launched a spread of bombs ahead of the ship. It was kind of like a spiky underwater grenade. Oh, wow. Allowed them to stay on target while maintaining sonar contact. So it seems like necessity is the mother of invention. I know World War II also played a significant role in pushing sonar technology forward. It did. What were some of the key advancements during that era? World War II was a period of intense competition, particularly between the US and Japan, in sonar development. Oh, wow. They were essentially in a sonar arms race, each side trying to outdo the other. And this led to breakthroughs in the development of transducers, which are the devices that convert electrical energy into sound waves and vice versa. The sources mentioned different types of transducers, like piezoelectric crystals and magnetostrictive materials. Can you explain those a bit more? Sure. Piezoelectric materials like quartz crystals generate an electrical charge when they're compressed or vibrated. And conversely, applying an electrical charge to them causes them to change shape. So this property makes them ideal for converting electrical signals into sound waves and back again. So by applying electrical pulses to these crystals, they could create the sound waves needed for sonar. Exactly. Now, magnetostrictive materials like nickel work a bit differently. They change shape in response to a magnetic field. So by using an electromagnet, you can make a nickel rod expand and contract, generating sound waves. So there were two competing technologies, essentially. Did one eventually win out? Well, it's not that simple. Both technologies had their strengths and weaknesses. For example, piezoelectric Rochelle salt crystals had excellent properties for sonar, but the magnetostrictive units, while less sensitive, were far more reliable. Interesting. Ironically, early in the war, the US offered significant losses to their merchant shipping due to limitations of their sonar, which heavily relied on those Rochelle salt crystals. Oh, so the technology they thought was superior actually ended up kind of backfiring on them. Exactly. It's a good lesson that reliability is just as crucial as performance. Right. Those losses forced the US to invest heavily in improving both magnetostrictive transducer performance and the reliability of piezoelectric materials. Okay. And that's when they stumbled upon ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, or ADP. It turned out to be a much more dependable alternative to Rochelle salt, and it became so successful that within just nine months, Rochelle salt was essentially obsolete for sonar. Wow, that's incredible. Talk about a glow up. From underdog to industry standard in under a year. Clearly wartime pressures can really accelerate technological progress, but it wasn't just material science. Right. They were also making advancements in the sonar systems themselves, right? Absolutely. A prime example of this is the sound surveillance system, or SOSUS, developed by the US in the 1950s. Okay. This was a network of passive sonar arrays designed for long-range detection of submarines, particularly Soviet submarines during the Cold War. So even when there wasn't active fighting, sonar was playing this critical role in global security. Absolutely. I imagine those Cold War sonar systems were very hush-hush. They were top secret. Okay. In fact, SOSUS remained classified until 1991, well after the Cold War had ended, which shows just how strategically important this technology was. Right. And over time, SOSUS was incorporated into a larger network called the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System, or IUSS. Okay. This system pulls together data from various sources to create a comprehensive picture of underwater activity. It's mind-boggling to think that what started as a way to locate icebergs and enemy ships evolved into this vast global surveillance network. It's pretty remarkable. But there's so much more to sonar than just its military applications. You're right. What's truly fascinating is how this technology, born from the necessities of war, found its way into a diverse range of civilian and scientific applications. Okay. It's like sonar opened a door to a whole new world, and we're just beginning to explore its possibilities. Okay, now I'm really intrigued. What are some of these other applications that we'll be diving into? Well, one of those obvious is in the fishing industry. Okay. Imagine being a fisherman and being able to see schools of fish beneath the surface. That's exactly what sonar allows them to do. That sounds like a game-changer for fishermen. So we'll be exploring how sonar revolutionized the fishing industry. Yes, and much more. Okay. We'll uncover how sonar is used to create detailed maps of the seafloor, navigate underwater vehicles, and even conduct groundbreaking scientific research. This is already shaping up to be an amazing deep dive. I can't wait to explore all these fascinating applications of sonar. So you mentioned sonar revolutionized the fishing industry. How exactly did that happen? Well, before sonar, fishermen relied mostly on luck and experience, and maybe some birds to point them toward good fishing spots. Sonar changed all that. Okay. It's like giving them x-ray vision for the ocean. Yeah, I can see how that would be a huge advantage. It is. Sonar lets fishermen find fish, estimate their size and quantity, and even locate lost nets. Wow. Modern fishing vessels are equipped with sophisticated sonar systems, often called fish finders. Okay. They've come a long way from just showing simple depth readings. Now they can generate detailed 3D images of the underwater environment. So fishermen can actually see the fish swimming around beneath their boats? Pretty much. That's wild. Does that make fishing too easy? Are there any concerns about overfishing because of this technology? That's a valid question. Yeah. And it's a debate within the fishing industry. Okay. On one hand, sonar helps fishermen target specific species and avoid unnecessary bycatch. But on the other hand, as the technology becomes more powerful, there's a risk of overexploiting fish populations if it's not used responsibly. It highlights the importance of sustainable fishing practices and regulations. Okay, that makes sense. Moving on, I know sonar is also used for navigation and mapping the seafloor. Right. How does that work? It's a technique called echo sounding. And it's similar to how bats use echolocation. Okay. A sonar device emits sound pulses. And by measuring the time it takes for those pulses to bounce back from the seabed, we can determine the water depth. By repeating this process over a large area, we can build up a detailed map of the ocean floor. So it's like creating an underwater topographic map. Exactly. These maps, called bathymetric maps, are essential for navigation, especially for submarines and underwater vehicles. Okay. They're also crucial for understanding underwater geology, identifying potential hazards, and even finding shipwrecks. Oh, wow. Speaking of underwater vehicles, I read that sonar is essential for operating remotely operated vehicles, ROVs, and unmanned underwater vehicles, or UUVs. Absolutely. Yeah. These vehicles are often used for exploration in deep, dark, and often dangerous environments. Sonar acts as their eyes, allowing them to navigate, avoid obstacles, and map the surroundings. Okay. In places where visibility is extremely limited. I see. Imagine trying to maneuver a complex piece of equipment through a maze of underwater cany
