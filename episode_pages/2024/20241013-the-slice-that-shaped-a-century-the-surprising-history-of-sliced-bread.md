## Transcript

All right, everybody, get ready for a deep dive into something you probably take for granted every day. Every day, really. You think everyone listening even encounters this thing every single day? Well, okay, maybe not every day, but it's something most of us encounter pretty often, and it has a fascinating history. We're talking about sliced bread. Sliced bread, now that's an interesting one. Right. It all started because a listener wrote in curious about that, saying, the best thing since sliced bread. Like, what makes sliced bread so special? And trust me, the answer is way more interesting than you might think. We're going to uncover wartime bans, unexpected technological ripple effects, and how this seemingly simple invention actually changed the way we eat. It really is remarkable when you think about it. I mean, before we had those perfectly sliced loaves on grocery store shelves, getting bread was a totally different experience. Okay, so paint us a picture here. What was the pre-sliced world like? Well, imagine this. You want some bread, right? But there are no neat little bags, no perfectly even slices. Instead, you get a whole loaf, maybe still warm from the oven, and you tear off a chunk. It was a communal thing, sharing a loaf, breaking bread together, literally. Breaking bread together. So that phrase goes way back. Way back. We're talking about a 30,000-year history here. Archaeological evidence shows early humans grinding grains, baking rudimentary bread. Wow, 30,000 years. So bread predates, like, the wheel. It really puts things in perspective, doesn't it? Over time, of course, bread evolved. The Greeks gave us yeast. The Romans, with their love of organization, they gave us public bakeries. But even with those advancements, bread was something you pour, not sliced. Until our friend Otto Frederick Rowetter came along. Otto Frederick Rowetter, the man who dared to slice bread. And what's fascinating is he wasn't even a baker. You're right. Rowetter's background was anything but ordinary. He was a jeweler with a degree in optics. Seems inventing was simply in his blood. A jeweler who revolutionized bread. Talk about range. Can you imagine those early conversations? Just trust me on this one. Everyone will want their bread pre-sliced. I'm sure those conversations were colorful. And it wasn't an easy road. His very first prototype, destroyed in a fire in 1917. All those blueprints, gone. Talk about a setback. What did he do? Give up. Rowetter, give up. Not a chance. It took 11 years. 11. But he rebuilt, redesigned, and finally, in 1928, the Chillicothe Baking Company in Missouri took a chance on him, and the world of bread was changed forever. The first loaves of pre-sliced bread. Seems so obvious now, so convenient. Were people immediately thrilled? You'd think so, right? But there were some doubters early on. Some thought it looked, well, messy. Others worried about the bread going stale faster. Figured it was just a fad. It's funny how even the most brilliant, life-changing inventions, sometimes they just take a little time to catch on. Humans, we can be creatures of habit. You know, it's funny how we think about these inventors, these people who change the world. You'd think Rowetter would be a household name, right? Yeah. I mean, he revolutionized something as basic as bread. But he actually stayed pretty anonymous. Got a few patents for his slicing and wrapping machines, but never became a celebrity inventor or anything. Ended up working for the company that bought his patent, actually. Micro-Westo Company of Iowa. Huh. A quiet hero behind a revolutionary invention. It makes you wonder how many other Otto Rowetters are out there, quietly shaping the world in ways we barely even notice. Probably more than we realize. And speaking of shaping the world, sliced bread's influence went way beyond just, you know, making neat sandwiches. Okay, so it wasn't just about convenience. What else did it impact? Think about it. One innovation can unexpectedly boost another. Take the toaster, for example. Believe it or not, toasters were actually invented way back in 1893. Really? Before sliced bread. Long before. But they never really caught on. People were still using those long forks or toasting bread over an open flame. Imagine. I guess it would be kind of tough to evenly toast a big, uneven hunk of bread in those early toasters. Exactly. But once you have those uniform slices, boom. The toaster becomes a must-have in every kitchen. And it doesn't stop there. Sliced bread led to standardized sizes, mass production. It changed the entire baking industry. And didn't that eventually lead to the development of the Chorleywood bread-making process? You got it. The Chorleywood process came about in 1961. It's a faster, more mechanized method for making bread. And it relies on those uniform slices that sliced bread made possible. I have to admit, I've heard of the Chorleywood process, but I'm not entirely sure what it is. It's a bit technical, but essentially it allows bakeries to churn out tons of bread really quickly. Softer, longer-lasting bread. Of course, it has its critics. Some say it compromises the taste and texture, but you can't deny its impact. And it all traces back to sliced bread. Wow. Talk about a domino effect. One innovation leading to another. So we've got convenience, we've got technological advancements. What about what people were actually eating? Did sliced bread change that too? Absolutely. It didn't just change how bread was made. It changed how much we ate. With those pre-sliced loaves readily available, people started eating way more bread. And not just bread, the consumption of spreads like jam, butter, peanut butter, it all went up too. Even today, bread is still a staple for a lot of people. Did you know over 326 million Americans still eat bread regularly? I'm definitely one of them. I can't imagine a world without it. But speaking of a world without sliced bread, we have to talk about this almost unbelievable chapter in its history. The Great Sliced Bread Ban of 1943. Oh yeah, the Great Sliced Bread Ban. Sounds like something out of a myth, doesn't it? It really does. What was going on there? Well, picture this. World War II is in full swing. The U.S. government is rationing everything. Meat, sugar, butter, the whole nine yards. Makes sense. Times were tough. Sacrifices had to be made. Right, but here's where it gets strange. They decided to ban sliced bread. They banned sliced bread? Seriously. Seriously. Their reasoning? To conserve resources, mainly wax paper and steel used in the slicing and wrapping process. Wait, on. They thought banning pre-sliced bread would help win the war. Did anyone point out that people could, you know, just slice the loaves themselves? You're not alone in thinking that. It does seem a bit, well, excessive. What's even stranger is that there wasn't even a shortage of wax paper at the time. So what was the real reason? Historians still debate that. Some think it was more about controlling bread prices, which were going up because of the war. Whatever the reason, people were not happy. Imagine opening the newspaper and finding out you couldn't buy pre-sliced bread anymore. I can only imagine the outrage. People were used to that convenience. How long did this ban even last? Thankfully, it was short-lived. Just three months after it started, the government, facing immense public pressure, tons of ridicule, they caved. Sliced bread was back on the menu. I bet there were some epic victory sandwiches being made that day. This whole thing just goes to show how important sliced bread had become in American life. Which brings us back to that famous saying, the best thing since sliced bread. How did this humble invention become the ultimate benchmark for innovation? It all started with marketing, believe it or not. Marketing? Wait, so you're telling me it wasn't some, I don't know, like organic cultural thing? Not exactly. It actually started popping up in advertisements. And get this, they were ads for other baking innovations. So wait, they were advertising things as being better than sliced bread? Pretty much. Like there's this one from 1933. A company was promoting their new thick and thin sliced loaves, right? And they called it the first improvement since sliced bread. Wow. So meta. Using the invention itself as the benchmark for innovation. That's pretty clever. Right. It shows you just how quickly sliced bread became shorthand for any kind of big game-changing progress. So when did it actually shift to describe, well, everything? Not just bread-related stuff. Earliest documented instance we have outside of the baking aisle, so to speak, is from 1951. American journalist Dorothy Kilgallen, she wrote about her sister swooning over this actor, Stuart Granger. Stuart Granger. He was in all those, like, adventure movies, right? Exactly. So he'd just been in that film, King Solomon's Mines. And Kilgallen's sister was smitten. Kilgallen said Granger was the greatest thing since sliced bread. I guess some things are timeless. A handsome actor on the big screen. It's amazing how a simple phrase from an advertisement could, you know, just take off like that, become this universal expression. It really is. And I think it stuck around because, well, sliced bread, it represents a simple but profound improvement. Those innovations that make you go, why didn't I think of that? Huh. It just makes life easier, better, you know? Totally. It's like looking
