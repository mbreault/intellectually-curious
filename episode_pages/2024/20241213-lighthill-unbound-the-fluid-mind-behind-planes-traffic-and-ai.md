## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone, to another deep dive. It's great to be back. Yeah, always fun to delve into these fascinating lives. And today, we're going to be looking at, well, I guess you could call him a bit more of a modern figure in the lineage of Lucasian professors of mathematics at Cambridge. Right. Sir James Lighthill, the 16th holder of the post. Now, his name might not be as familiar to everyone as, say, a Newton or a Hawking. Yeah. But his impact on applied mathematics is undeniable. Oh, for sure. I mean, especially in fields like, when you think about things like fluid dynamics and aeroacoustics, things we're going to get into today, he was really, you know, a leading figure. A pioneer, really. Yeah. I mean, his work has genuinely shaped the way that we understand things that move. Exactly. You know, and not just like, you know, high-level concepts. I mean, we're talking about airplanes. We're even going to be talking about traffic jams today. I think listeners are going to be surprised by just how much Lighthill's work touches their everyday lives. Yeah, no, I think that's a great point. So let's get started. Let's go back to the beginning. Lighthill's story, like many of these, begins in, you know, the hallowed halls of these institutions. But in his case, it actually starts in Paris in 1924. Paris. Yeah. His family moved to England when he was young, but, you know, already maybe a sign of his kind of, you know, intellectual curiosity, right? Interesting, yeah. Different cultures and all that. But anyway, he went on to attend Winchester College, and then, of course, you know, the kind of the necessary stop on this journey that we're going through, Trinity College, Cambridge. Of course. Now, even as a student, keep in mind, this is during World War II. Oh, wow. So you've got this backdrop of global conflict and uncertainty, and here he is graduating with a Bachelor of Arts at just 19 years old. Remarkable. Yeah. So, I mean, you can see already this kind of, I don't know, an early sign that maybe there's something special here. Yeah, incredible talent. All right, so he's at Cambridge. He's surrounded by all this, you know, rich intellectual history. Right. Where did his interest lie? What area of math did he gravitate towards? He specialized in fluid dynamics. Okay. Now, fluid dynamics, you know, not exactly something that comes up at the dinner table every day. Not for most people, no. But I think it's important to sort of lay that groundwork, like why is this important? Why should we care about fluid dynamics? Well, it's crucial for understanding how things move through air and water. So anything from designing airplanes to predicting the weather, even to understanding how blood flows in our bodies. Yeah. So much of, you know, the world around us is governed by these principles. Exactly. So it has applications pretty much everywhere. Okay, so that's fluid dynamics, and Lighthill's like, you know, at the forefront of this. Tell us about his early career, the institutions he was involved with. Well, after Cambridge, he actually started his career at the National Physical Laboratory, and then he moved on to the University of Manchester, where he became the Bayer Professor of Applied Mathematics. But his path didn't end in academia. Ah, so there's more to this story. Yeah, it gets even more interesting. He went on to become the Director of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. The Royal Aircraft Establishment? Yes, and that's where his work really took on a whole new dimension. He was involved in all sorts of cutting-edge stuff, satellites, spacecraft, even the development of Concorde. Really? Concorde? Yeah, very cool stuff. So he's moving from this kind of theoretical research into this really hands-on application. I mean, we're talking big-time stuff here. Yeah, I mean, you think about, you know, the historical context, the Cold War and all that. It's like these are major, major projects. Exactly. Okay, so he's doing all of this. But before we go too far down that road, let's talk about a field that he's, I think, particularly known for, and that's aeroacoustics. Ah, yes, aeroacoustics. So what is aeroacoustics for folks who might not be familiar? Well, in essence, it's the study of noise generated by aerodynamic forces. So in simpler terms, he was trying to understand and ultimately reduce the roar of jet engines. You know, that's something that I think a lot of people take for granted today, right? Because you get on a plane, it's relatively quiet. I mean, it's loud, but this wasn't always the case. No, not at all. In the early days of jet travel, it was a huge problem. I mean, I can only imagine. Oh, it was incredibly loud. Yeah. So how did Lighthill tackle this problem? Well, he used his deep understanding of fluid dynamics, and he developed, through some really insightful mathematical modeling, what we now know as Lighthill's eighth power law. The eighth power law. Okay, so break that down for us. What does that mean? It means that the power of the sound a jet engine produces is proportional to the eighth power of its speed. Oh, I see where the eighth power comes in. Right, exactly. But okay, in practical terms, what does that mean? So basically, even small reductions in the speed of the jet engine could lead to dramatic decreases in noise. So this discovery had a profound impact on jet engine design. It made air travel significantly quieter. I mean, think about it. All of us who've flown on planes, we owe a debt of gratitude to Lighthill. Yeah, I mean, you know, whenever I'm sitting on a plane, I'm always thinking about the math behind the jet engines. But no, you're right. It is fascinating to think about how, you know, this abstract math concept can have such a real impact on the world. Yeah, absolutely. It changed the world. Okay, so he's up in the sky. He's tackling the roar of jet engines. But Lighthill, his work wasn't just confined to the realm of aerospace, right? I mean, we alluded to this earlier, but he also worked on something that I think a lot more people could probably relate to. You mean traffic? Yeah, traffic. How did a mathematician who specialized in fluid dynamics end up tackling traffic jams? Well, it all comes down to his incredible ability to see connections across seemingly completely different fields. Yeah, because that seems like a bit of a leap, right? It does. But he applied the same mathematical principles used to model flood waves in rivers to analyze how cars move on highways. Hold on, flood waves and traffic jams? I mean, how do you even make that connection? Well, it might seem counterintuitive, but it's actually a brilliant example of how mathematical modeling can reveal these underlying patterns that connect different things. And Lighthill's work in this area, it provided really groundbreaking insights into the dynamics of traffic flow. It helped us understand how and why traffic jams form. So instead of just looking at traffic as like individual cars, he's looking at it as like a system. Exactly. He saw it as a system with its own patterns and behaviors, just like a flowing river. That's amazing. And this approach has really had a lasting impact on how we understand and try to manage traffic congestion. Okay, so we've got him tackling these really... I mean, these are big problems, right? Air travel, traffic. I mean, these are things that affect millions of people every day. Every day, yeah. All right, so we can't talk about Lighthill without talking about, of course, his time as the Lucasian professor at Cambridge. That's right. So what did he focus on during this period? I mean, because we've got fluid dynamics, we've got aer acoustics, we've got traffic flow. Is there more? Well, from 1969 to 1979, he held that position, following in the footsteps, as you said, of these giants like Newton and Dirac. And it was during this time that he became interested in... Well, it's something that's become really, really relevant today, and that is artificial intelligence. AI? Okay, this seems like a pretty big jump from fluid dynamics and aer acoustics. What sparked his interest there? In the early 1970s, he was actually commissioned to write a report by the Science Research Council. And it was a report on the state of AI research. And this report, which became known as the Lighthill Report, ended up being quite controversial. Controversial? Why is that? Well, his conclusions were actually quite critical of the AI research being done at the time. He argued that a lot of researchers were overly focused on what he called grandiose objectives. What do you mean by grandiose objectives? Well, things like trying to create machines that could think exactly like humans. Okay. He felt that AI research should focus on more practical applications. Like what? What sorts of things? Things like automating industrial processes or improving medical diagnosis. Areas where AI could actually provide tangible benefits to society. I mean, that's something that I think, you know, even today, decades later, we're still grappling with that, right? The balance between the sort of big, ambitious goals of AI, like, you know, general intelligence and things like that, versus, you know, delivering things that can help us now. It's really fascinating, isn't it? How that debate from, you know, the 1970s is still very much alive today. Yeah
