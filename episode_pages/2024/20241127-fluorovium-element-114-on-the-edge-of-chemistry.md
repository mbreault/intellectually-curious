## Description

A quick dive into the synthetic heavy element fluorovium (element 114): how it's created in particle accelerators, why it lasts only moments, the debates over its chemistry under extreme relativistic effects, and the Island of Stability that guides researchers toward longer-lived isotopesâ€”and what that quest could mean for science and technology.

## Transcript

Welcome, everyone. Ready to dive into the world of fluorovium. Element 114, right? Yep, fluorovium, element 114. And, you know, just to set the scene, it's synthetic. So not just walking around finding it, then. Exactly. Doesn't exist naturally. Got to make it in a lab. Super heavy, extremely radioactive. Sounds fun. Oh, it is, trust me. So we're going to unpack all that. How it's made, what we think it's like, all based on what's on, you know, the Wikipedia page for fluorovium. Well, good thing Wikipedia is pretty reliable most of the time. For sure. So fluorovium, it's way at the edge of the periodic table. Really pushes what we know about chemistry. It's a new frontier, huh? Yeah, you could say that. Okay, so first things first, how do they even make an element like this? It's not like mixing stuff in a beaker. Nah, nothing that simple. Think particle accelerators, huge, powerful things. I'm vaguely picturing that, yeah. You're basically, it's like you're trying to hit one atom with another atom. Incredibly tiny target. Talk about needing good aim. You're smashing these nuclei together, lighter ones into heavy ones, hoping they fuse. That's how you get super heavy elements. So for fluorovium specifically, what's the recipe? Plutonium-244, that's your starting point. And you bombard that with calcium-48 nuclei. Sounds wild, right? Kind of, yeah. And then boom, fluorovium. Well, if you're lucky, a few atoms pop out. But it's not over then, not even close. Wait, making it is only step one. I figured that was the hard part. Oh, it's unstable, fluorovium. Like really unstable. Most of its forms, they decay in seconds. Seconds, why? Yeah, so back in 98, scientists thought they'd got it. They saw one atom, lasted 30.4 seconds, then poof, gone. Talk about fleeting. And later, people were like, wait, was that even fluorovium? So how'd they know for sure they'd made it if the first time was so iffy? Persistence. They did the experiment again in 99, got two atoms this time. Two whole atoms, lucky them. They decayed a bit differently, these ones. Half-life wasn't the same. So that helped confirm it. Plus more experiments after that, yeah. So fluorovium is real, just super hard to hold on to. Okay, so it exists, it's heavy, disappears fast. But what's its personality like, chemically speaking? Million dollar question. And the answer is... We're still working on it. Gotta love science. Never a dull moment. Right. So early experiments, like back in the 2000s, they thought maybe it acted like a noble gas. Very unreactive, standoffish. Interesting. But later on, research suggested it's more metallic. Hold on, a metallic noble gas? Isn't that a contradiction? Yeah, it seems weird, right? But here's the thing. It's all down to what we call relativistic effects. Ooh, sounds complicated. In super heavy elements like fluorovium, the electrons are zooming around the nucleus ridiculously fast. Like how fast? Close to the speed of light fast. Okay, that's fast. And that messes with things. Their mass gets bigger, the orbitals change shape. Orbitals, like where the electrons hang out? Yep, exactly. So basically, it's hard to predict how fluorovium behaves. The speeding electrons throw a wrench in the works. So mapping out its chemistry. Gotta be tricky if the rules are different. Oh, it's a challenge for sure. But that's what makes it so exciting, you know? I can see that. Like it could have totally new properties unlike anything we've seen before. Could blur the lines between metals and noble gases, yeah. Fluorovium, the chemical chameleon. But honestly, why should we care? Good point, right. It's here for a second, then gone, and even then, we barely know what it is. Exactly. But here's the thing. When we push the boundaries of science like this, explore these extreme elements, it often leads to amazing stuff, you know? Things we never expected, new technologies. Okay, I can get behind that. Like what kind of practical things could come from studying something as weird as fluorovium? Think about radioactivity back when it was discovered. Seemed pretty out there, right? Totally. Nobody knew it changed medicine, energy, all that. True, true. Fluorovium, these super heavy elements, they could be the same. Open doors we can't even imagine yet. So it's like a gateway to the unknown. Exactly. Who knows what secrets it holds? And there's more to the story too. Remember you mentioned the island of stability? Oh, yeah, that sounds intriguing. That adds another whole layer of mystery to fluorovium. Okay, I'm hooked. Tell me more about this island of stability. Well, it's this theoretical region on the periodic table. It's this idea, right, that somewhere on the periodic table there's this zone. A zone? Yeah, like a region where super heavy elements could actually hang around for a while. Hang around, meaning... Not decay so fast. Longer half-lives, way longer. See, usually the heavier you get on the table, the more unstable. Makes sense. More stuff crammed in, more likely to fall apart. Exactly. It's all about that repulsion, the protons in the nucleus pushing each other away. Okay, so how does this island or whatever, how's it different? Well, scientists think there might be these, like, magic numbers. Magic numbers. Of what? Protons and neutrons. Certain combos, and they make the nucleus extra stable. Why would that be? I mean, it's not like they're arranging themselves neatly in there, right? Kind of, actually. They have shells inside the nucleus. Protons and neutrons do. Whoa, like electrons have shells around it. Similar idea, yeah. So if you hit those magic numbers, fill the shells just right... Then it's happy, stable. Balanced, yeah. Less of that pushing apart feeling. So where does fluorovium fit in? Is it on this magical island? At first they thought so. Specifically, fluorovium-298, that isotope. What's special about that one? 114 protons, 184 neutrons. Doubly magic, they called it. Sounds powerful. Right. The prediction was it could last for years. Years. Compared to seconds, that's practically forever. Imagine what you could do with it if you had that much time. Yeah, the possibilities were huge. But more recent research... Oh. It kind of suggests the island's center, the most stable spot, might be somewhere else. Somewhere else? Like, did fluorovium get evicted? Think more like the island shifted a bit on the map. So fluorovium-298, not the magic key, it seemed. Maybe not the key. But doesn't mean there aren't other long-lived fluorovium isotopes out there. Just maybe not right smack dab in the middle of the island. Okay, so there's still hope. Oh, absolutely. And keep in mind, this whole island thing, it's still theoretical. We're still mapping it out. Every new discovery adds to the picture. So back to fluorovium. We know it's hard to make, decays fast. How do you even study something like that? It's like trying to analyze a shooting star in a test tube. Ha! Great image. It is a challenge, but scientists are clever, you know? They've come up with ways to work with these fleeting elements. Like what? Spill the secrets. Well, you make tiny amounts, just a few atoms at a time. Then you gotta be super precise, control everything, temperature, pressure. Yeah, room for error, huh? Nope. And then you need detectors, really sensitive ones, to catch the data before it's gone. It's a race against time, basically. Exactly. So those early experiments, the ones that hinted at fluorovium acting like a noble gas... Yeah, remind me, how'd they do those? They looked at how fluorovium atoms interacted with a gold surface. Gold? Why gold? Noble gases, they're the loners of the periodic table, right? Don't react much, even with metals like gold. Right. So fluorovium, it kind of did the same. Weak interaction with the gold, didn't want to bond much. Okay, so like, they bounced off each other. Not literally, I guess, but... It's more like their electron clouds are influencing each other, maybe forming super weak bonds. Relativistic effects make it complicated, but... The point is, it was a clue that fluorovium might be shy, chemically speaking. Like a super heavy introvert, right? Something like that. But then... Well, the story gets more interesting. What happened? Later on, different experiments, especially some done at the GSI in Germany, they started getting different results. Fluorovium seemed more reactive than they thought. So not so standoffish after all. Maybe not. And its interactions with gold, they were more typical of a metal. So which is it? Metal or noble gas? Make up your mind, fluorovium. Huh, right. Some scientists even think fluorovium, along with its neighbor copernicium, they might be a whole new category. Ooh, a new category. What's that? Volatile metals. Wait, volatile metals? Isn't that like an oxymoron? It sounds weird, yeah. But think of it like this. You got your typical metals, solid, shiny, right
