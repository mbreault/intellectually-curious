## Description

Take a deep dive into cobalt's journeyâ€”from ancient blue pigments in Egyptian art to its central role in vitamin B12, high-temperature superalloys, and the batteries powering modern devices and EVs. We uncover the mischievous origin of its name, examine ethical sourcing and artisanal mining in the DRC, and explore efforts toward safer practices, recycling, and alternatives as demand climbs.

## Transcript

Welcome in. Today we're taking a deep dive into something a little different, cobalt. You've sent us a really interesting mix of articles and research on it. Clearly you're not just after the basics, so buckle up because we're about to uncover the surprising story of this element. Absolutely, and you might be surprised just how far back this story goes. We're talking millennia. Okay, so paint me a picture. What does cobalt have to do with ancient history? Imagine the vibrant blues of ancient Egyptian art and glassware. Uh-huh. That captivating color. Yeah. It came from cobalt compounds. Wow. In fact, they even found traces of it in King Tut's tomb. Wow, talk about leaving your mark. So it wasn't just an Egyptian thing then? Not at all. This blue was highly prized across the ancient world. We see it in Persian ceramics, Chinese porcelain from the Tang and Ming dynasties. Cobalt was a global influencer, even back then. It's incredible to think that this element we're going to be talking about, which is so vital to our modern technology, was once prized for its beauty. But it wasn't always easy to work with, was it? You're right, and that's where its name comes from. For centuries, no one really knew what cobalt was. Miners often mistook it for bismuth, and they gave it a rather mischievous name, cobalt. From the German word kobold, meaning goblin. Goblins? Why goblins? Well, it wasn't exactly a term of endearment. Cobalt ores were notoriously difficult to smelt. They released toxic fumes because of the arsenic often found alongside cobalt, making them a real hazard to work with. So naturally, miners attributed these troubles to mischievous goblins lurking within the earth. Makes you wonder how many other scientific mysteries were attributed to the supernatural back then. But it's fascinating to see how our understanding has evolved. It's almost like cobalt has gone from being this hidden, almost mystical thing to being this essential but often unseen element in our technology today. I mean, most people probably don't realize that the battery in their smartphone relies on cobalt. It's true. Cobalt is a critical component of lithium-ion batteries, the powerhouses behind so many of our devices. Smartphones, laptops, even electric vehicles. And speaking of electric vehicles, that brings us to a whole other facet of cobalt. The demand, the sourcing, and the ethical considerations surrounding it all. Right. But we'll save that conversation for after a quick break. Okay. And it's that demand for electric vehicles that is really putting cobalt in the spotlight. Yeah. Especially when we consider where it comes from. Right, because the majority of the world's cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, isn't it? That's right. Yeah. And while this abundance makes the DRC a vital player in the global supply chain, it's also a region that has faced challenges when it comes to mining practices. That's something I'm really curious to unpack a bit. Okay. When we talk about challenges, what are we talking about specifically? One of the biggest concerns is the issue of artisanal mining. Okay. These are smaller scale mining operations, often informal. And unfortunately, they've been linked to worker exploitation and even child labor in some instances. That's incredibly concerning, especially given how essential cobalt is becoming to our technological progress. It's a stark reminder that we can't just focus on the benefits of a material without addressing the potential consequences of its extraction. Exactly. And it's a complex issue with no easy solutions. Right. There are ongoing efforts to improve conditions for artisanal miners, promote safer practices, and address the root causes that lead to these exploitative situations. So it's a work in progress, but at least there's a focus on finding solutions and driving positive change. Absolutely. But let's shift gears for a moment because in our research, we also came across something pretty surprising, cobalt's connection to our health. It is unexpected. Yeah. Most people don't realize that cobalt plays a vital role in our bodies. Okay. It's a crucial component of vitamin B12. Wait, really? Yes. I have to admit, I had no idea. Okay. I know vitamin B12 is important for energy and red blood cells, but I never made the connection to cobalt. It's a fascinating connection. Yeah. Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, has a cobalt atom right at its center. Wow. Without cobalt, our bodies wouldn't be able to produce this essential vitamin. So we've gone from goblins and toxic fumes to an element that's essential for our well-being. Yes. That's quite a range. It is. Yeah. And that range extends even further when we consider cobalt's role in some of our most advanced technologies. Okay. Remember those super alloys we touched on earlier? You mean the ones used in jet engines and high-performance machinery? Exactly. Yeah, those are pretty incredible. Yeah. But what makes them so super and how does cobalt fit in? Super alloys earn their name because they can withstand incredibly high temperatures and pressures without losing their strength or corroding easily. Okay. And cobalt is a key ingredient in achieving those properties. Wow. It acts like a kind of binding agent, holding the alloy together and giving it that incredible resilience. So in a way, it's like cobalt provides the backbone for these materials, allowing them to perform in these extreme conditions. Right. It's mind-blowing when you think about it. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable. From ancient artwork to cutting-edge technology, even inside our own bodies, cobalt has this incredible versatility. And it's that versatility that makes its story so captivating. Yeah. But as we've discussed, it's also a reminder that progress often comes with complexities. Right. As we rely more and more on cobalt for things like electric vehicles, it becomes even more important to ensure that this reliance is sustainable and ethical. It really makes you think about the bigger picture, doesn't it? We get excited about new technology, and rightfully so, but there's this whole other side to the story, the sourcing of the materials, the mining practices, the ethical implications. It's a lot to consider. It is, and it's a conversation that's only going to become more important as the demand for cobalt continues to rise. But the good news is, there's a lot of work being done to address these challenges. That's encouraging to hear. What are some of the ways people are trying to make cobalt mining more sustainable and ethical? Well, for starters, there's a big push to improve conditions in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Organizations are working directly with artisanal miners to promote safer mining practices, provide training and education, and help them form cooperatives to give them more bargaining power. So empowering the miners themselves to be part of the solution. That makes a lot of sense. Exactly. And beyond that, there's a lot of research being done to find alternative materials for batteries. Scientists and engineers are experimenting with things like lithium iron phosphate batteries, which don't require cobalt at all. So potentially reducing our reliance on cobalt altogether, that would be a game changer. It could be. And there's also a lot of focus on improving recycling methods. Right now, we're not very good at recovering cobalt from old electronics. But if we can get better at that, it could significantly reduce the need to mine new cobalt. It's like closing the loop, creating a more circular economy for these materials. That's really promising. It is. And it just goes to show that with every challenge, there's an opportunity for innovation and positive change. Absolutely. It's been eye-opening to explore all the different facets of cobalt, from its ancient history as a pigment to its crucial role in modern technology, and even its presence within our own bodies. It's clear that this is one element with a truly multifaceted story. It certainly is. And it's a story that's still being written. And on that note, we'll wrap up this deep dive into the world of cobalt. But as you go about your day, maybe scrolling through your phone or driving in your car, take a moment to think about the cobalt that's quietly powering these technologies and all the complexities that come with it. It's a fascinating world waiting to be discovered. Thanks for joining us.
