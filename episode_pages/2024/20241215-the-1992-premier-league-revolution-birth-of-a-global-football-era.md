## Transcript

All right, so we're going back to 1992 for a deep dive into the first Premier League season. Well, you got your Wikipedia notes and some personal scribbles? This is where it all began. The season that changed English football forever. Forever. It wasn't just about goals and matches. Yeah. It was a cultural earthquake. Really? We're talking about the birth of a global phenomenon. I mean, a brand new league snags a Â£304 million broadcasting deal right out of the gate. Right. With Sky and the BBC putting down serious cash. Massive. Even by today's standards, that's a lot of money. And that's where the revolution started. Oh, yeah. That money allowed clubs to attract players that they could only dream of before suddenly English football was the place to be. Wow. And the whole world was watching. Okay, but picture this. A young, relatively unproven striker gets snatched up for a record-breaking Â£3.6 million. Â£3.6. Alan Shearer to Blackburn Rovers. Headlines everywhere. That's right. That transfer wasn't just about Shearer's talent. Right. It was a statement. Yeah. Blackburn, a newly promoted team, flocks their financial muscle. Wow. And sent shockwaves through the league. It really did. It was a sign of things to come. Yeah. The power shift had begun. Yeah, it was like, hey world, the Premier League is here and we're playing for keeps. Right. But all this talk about money and transfers, let's not forget about the actual football who kicked off the scoring in this brave new world. That honor goes to Brian Dean playing for Sheffield United. No way. And wouldn't you know it, his first Premier League goal was against Manchester United. Oh wow, talk about a baptism by fire. Talk about it. Everyone's watching wondering what this new league will bring. Yeah. And Bam Dean scores. That's right. But what about the first hat trick? Ah, that was the enigmatic Eric Cantona back when he was still with Leeds United. Yeah. He put three past Tottenham Hotspur, showing the league a glimpse of the magic he was about to unleash. Cantona, he was box office, wasn't he? Oh yeah. Always seemed to have a flair for the dramatic. Oh, for sure. Okay, so we've had the first goal, the first hat trick. What about the 1,000th goal? Okay. That must have been a moment. Picture this, Mike Newell of Blackburn Rovers away at Nottingham Forest. Okay. The tension builds and he slots at home. Wow. I bet the Forest ground, usually so loud, went completely silent for a second. You've painted quite a picture. So the season is underway, goals are flying in, and there's this one team everyone's watching, Manchester United. Yeah. They end up becoming the first ever Premier League champions. That's right. But it wasn't exactly a walk in the park, was it? Not at all. They had a bit of a shaky start. Really? You know, they were finding their feet in this new landscape. But then, enter Eric Cantona. Ah, Cantona again. That's right. Seems like he was everywhere that season. He was. What was it about him that changed the game for Manchester United? He was like a jolt of electricity to the team. His arrival in November seemed to spark something. Not just in his own play, but in the whole squad. Really? Suddenly they were playing with a swagger. Oh, wow. A confidence that hadn't been there before. So it sounds like Cantona was the missing piece of the puzzle for them. Yeah, you could say that. But even with him, it wasn't a runaway victory, was it? No, they had to work for it. Really? Alex Ferguson, the mastermind that he was, had to adapt his tactics, figure out how to get the best out of his players in this new, faster-paced league. They ended up finishing 10 points clear of Aston Villa. Wow. Which sounds like a lot. Yeah. But believe me, it was a battle every step of the way. 10 points is still a pretty hefty margin. Yeah. Speaking of surprises, how about Norwich City finishing third? Absolutely. That must have raised some eyebrows. Norwich, under the brilliant Mike Walker, played this incredibly attacking, entertaining brand of football. Okay. They weren't afraid to go for it. Really? What's really remarkable... What's that? ...is that they qualified for Europe with a negative goal difference. Wait, hold on. Negative goal difference and European qualification. Yep. Can you explain that for those who might not be familiar with the ins and outs of the beautiful game? Of course. Okay. Basically, it means they conceded more goals than they scored throughout the season. Okay. Typically, that wouldn't get you into European competition. Right. But Norwich's attacking style, their ability to score goals, even while conceding, earned them enough points to finish third. So they were like the entertainers of the league. Yeah. Winning hearts, even if they weren't always winning by a huge margin. Exactly. It seems like this season was full of these unexpected turns. But while some teams were exceeding expectations, others were facing a different reality. That's the nature of football. Yeah. For every triumph, there's a heartbreak. Yeah. And for Nottingham Forest, a club steeped in history and success, that heartbreak came in the form of relegation. It must have been a particularly tough pill to swallow. Oh, yeah. For their legendary manager, Brian Clough. He had achieved so much with that club. It was a poignant end to an era. It was. Clough had been at the helm for 18 years. That's a long time. Guiding them to unimaginable heights. Right. But this season, they were a team in transition, rebuilding after selling key players like Teddy Sheringham, who ironically went on to win the Golden Boot that season. I know, right? After such a long and illustrious career, Clough decided to call it a day. Yeah, it was time. What a bittersweet way to bow out. It was. A true legend leaving the stage. That's right. But Forest weren't the only ones battling relegation, were they? No. Sadly, the drop also claimed Middlesbrough and Crystal Palace. Oh. For Middlesbrough, it was a harsh return to reality after just earning promotion. Yeah. While Crystal Palace lost a crucial match on the final day of the season, ending up just one point shy of safety. Wow. Imagine the tension. Yeah. The heartbreak for those fans. Football can be a cruel mistress sometimes. It can? One moment you're on top of the world, the next you're facing the drop. Yeah. Speaking of moments, let's shift gears and talk about the players who lit up this inaugural season. Okay. The Golden Boot. Yeah. The award for the top scorer went to... Teddy Sheringham. Sheringham. The very same player who started the season with Nottingham Forest before transferring to Tottenham Hotspur. Really? He ended up bagging 22 goals. Wow. Proving his worth as a clinical finisher. Yeah. It's a testament to his adaptability, his ability to thrive even amidst the upheaval of a midseason transfer. So he didn't let the pressure of a big move phase him. No, he didn't. That's impressive. It is. But goals aren't everything, right? Right. The PFA Player of the Year award, as voted by the players themselves, went to... Oh, McGrath. McGrath. A rock in the heart of Aston Villa's defense. Yeah. His strength, his composure, his ability to read the game. He was a true leader on the pitch. Wow. It shows that even in a season filled with attacking flair, defensive solidity was still highly valued. It's like that saying, defense wins championships, right? Right. But it wasn't just the established stars who... What about the young guns making their mark? Okay. The PFA Young Player of the Year award went to none other than Ryan Giggs. Giggs. Playing for Manchester United. No way. This is his second year in a row winning the award. Wow. He was only 19 years old at the time. 19. But already showcasing the dazzling skills and electrifying pace that would make him a Manchester United legend. Talk about a bright future. It was winning the Young Player of the Year award two years in a row and a Premier League title in the same season. Wow. That's the stuff dreams are made of. It is. But were there any other players who deserve a shout out? Oh, yeah. Players who might not have won the big individual awards, but still made a significant impact. Absolutely. Players like Bobby Mims. Ah, Bobby Mims. Yeah. The goalkeeper for Blackburn Rovers. Right. He might not have had the flair of some of his teammates. Right. But he was a model of consistency. Okay. Leading the league with 19 clean sheets. Wow. A true testament to his shot-stopping abilities and command of his area. It's amazing how those clean sheets can sometimes make all the difference in a tight race. Oh, yeah. You need a reliable presence between the sticks to win titles. For sure. Okay, before we move on to the next part of our deep dive, there's one more record from this season that I find particularly intriguing. Okay. And it's a bit ironic. What is it? You must be talking about the record for the lowest Premier League attendance. Right. You got it. Wimbledon playing their home game against Everton at Selhurst Park managed to attract a crowd of just over 3,000 people. Wow. It's quite a stark contrast. It is. To the packed stadiums and global audience the Premier League enjoys today. I know. But it also highlights the humble beginnings. Yeah. The challenges those early
