## Description

We explore the A train stops sequence (4, 14, 23, 34, 42, ‚Ä¶, up to 207) from OEIS and how a simple list of numbers encodes the city‚Äôs growth. From station additions and expansions to the Dykeman Street ‚Äú200th Street‚Äù ghost, this episode shows how data can be a timeline of urban development‚Äîand how cross-referenced OEIS sequences illuminate a wider subway-story web.

## Transcript

Hey everyone, welcome back for another deep dive. You ready to go deep? Always. What have we got today? Well, get ready to explore the New York City subway. Oh cool. But, and here's the twist, not in the way you might think. Okay, I'm intrigued. Yeah, we're not talking about like, you know, the best pizza slice near a certain stop. Right, right. Or crazy delays or anything like that. Gotcha. Instead, we're looking at a unique data set, the numbered stops of the A train. Oh wow. Back in February of 2000. Okay, specific. Yeah, very specific. I like it. And here's the other cool thing. What's that? Our source isn't some, you know, dusty old transit authority document. Oh really? No. What is it then? This is where it gets kind of crazy. Okay. It's the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Whoa, okay, that's not what I was expecting. I know, right? It's basically this massive online database of, well, sequences of numbers. Right, right. It's kind of like finding a hidden melody, but with numbers. Oh, that's a good way to put it. I know, right? And you definitely should. It's so fascinating. It's like you can find patterns in anything. Right. And just a heads up for all you number files out there. I love it. There's a great number file video. Really? Yeah, by Brady Haran and J.A. Sloan about subway numbers. I have to check it out. Oh, for sure. I'm ready to dive into this A train data though. Okay, let's do it. Let's go. So the OEIS entry lists the A train stops like this. 4, 14, 23, 34, 42, and so on, all the way up to 207. Huh. Now you tell me what's going on with this sequence. Well, it's definitely not straightforward, that's for sure. Right. It's a bit like a puzzle. Totally. These numbers, they reflect how the A line, which runs like what, 70 blocks? Yeah, from 207th Street in Inwood, Manhattan. All the way down to Far Rockaway in Queens. Exactly. Crazy how it's evolved over time. You know, like you add new stations, you extend existing lines. Right. And it just throws off that simple numerical order. It's like the subway itself is a time capsule. Ooh, I like that. Right. Yeah. Preserving traces of decisions made like who knows how many years ago. Precisely. I mean, just look at that jump from stop 4 to 14. Yeah. That right there. Yeah. That could indicate like a whole bunch of stations got added in that stretch. And some big expansion project, you know? Exactly. We could actually like trace the different phases of the subway's growth just by looking at the gaps and jumps. That's amazing. I never realized how much history is hiding in plain sight. Right? It's fascinating. Like just these little station numbers. You wouldn't think it, but... Speaking of history. Yeah. This one really blew my mind. Oh, lay it on me. One of the stations listed is Dykeman Street. Okay. Yeah. Used to be called Deckman Street 200th Street. Oh, interesting. But here's the thing. There never was a 200th Street in that part of Manhattan. Really? Yeah. It's crazy, right? That's wild. It's like a 200th Street ghost street. I love it. So what's the deal? Well, this little numbering anomaly points to something pretty fascinating. What's that? A disconnect between planned and actual street development in upper Manhattan. So maybe the city had plans for a 200th Street. Could be. But they just like never happened. It's possible. Or maybe the name reflects like an older street grid system. Oh, wow. That they later revised. So this seemingly random subway stop number is actually giving us a glimpse into how the city street grid itself evolved. Absolutely. And you know what? If anyone wants to dive even deeper into this, the OEIS entry for the A train stops, it cross-references a bunch of other fascinating sequences. Really? Yeah. All subway related. Like what? Like they track things like station closures, line extensions, you know. It's like a whole nother level of understanding how complex the subway system is. That's so cool. Yeah. Like there's A000053, A0001049, A0007826, A011554, A208359, A208360. Wow. A whole rabbit hole of numerical patterns. It's crazy, right? It is. So even a simple list of subway stops can reveal like these hidden layers of history and urban development. Exactly. It really makes you think. Yeah. About like what other data sets are out there? Yeah, yeah. Seemingly mundane, but could actually hold these fascinating stories. If we just look closely enough. Exactly. That's a great question. It is, right? The world is full of hidden patterns just waiting to be like, you know, discovered and decoded. Oh, I love that. It's exciting. Maybe our next deep dive will uncover the secrets. Oh, what secrets? Hidden in parking meter numbers. Okay. Or zip codes. Interesting. Who knows? Until then, happy exploring. Keep on diving, everybody. See you next time. Bye.
