## Transcript

Welcome back everyone, ready for another deep dive? Always. Today we're going to be looking at thallium. Thallium. Yeah. Well, you might recognize it from some crime novels. Oh right, the poison. Exactly. But we're going to see that there's actually way more to thallium than just its notoriety as a poisonous tool. I'm intrigued. So, to get started with this deep dive, we've got some great sources. We've got some excerpts from the Royal Society of Chemistry's periodic table website. The RSC, nice. We've also got a Wikipedia article on thallium. And this is kind of cool, we've got an AI-generated summary of thallium's applications. Oh, that's interesting. AI summaries are getting pretty good these days. Yeah, they really are. So, let's start with a little history lesson. Thallium was actually discovered fairly recently, back in 1861. 1861, wow. That's not that long ago, considering. Right, and what's really fascinating is that two chemists, William Crooks and Claude-Auguste Lamy, they both discovered it independently. No way, at the same time. Yep. And get this, they were both using this brand new technique at the time called flame spectroscopy. Flame spectroscopy. Yeah, so basically you burn a sample of material and then you look at the light it gives off through a prism. Oh, I see. Each element gives off a unique spectrum of light, like a fingerprint. Exactly. So, Crooks, he was the first one to notice this bright green line in the spectrum. Green, huh? So that's where the name thallium comes from. You got it. Thallium comes from the Greek word thalos, which means a green shoot or a twig. It's kind of ironic considering its reputation as a poison. Right, you'd think they might have gone with something a little more menacing sounding, ha ha. But hey, sometimes appearances can be deceiving, right? True enough. So Crooks noticed the green spectral line, but Lamy, he actually went a step further. What did he do? He managed to actually isolate a small piece of thallium metal. Wow, so there was kind of a race to be recognized as the discoverer. Yeah, there was definitely some competition there. It just goes to show that, you know, scientific discoveries aren't always clear cut. There's a human element to it too. For sure. And I bet that rivalry probably pushed both of them to work even harder. Definitely. Now let's talk about some of the properties of thallium. It's got this, what I like to call a dual personality because of its two main oxidation states. Oxidation states. Can you explain that a bit? Not all of us are chemists here. Oh, right. Sure. So think of oxidation states as like different costumes an element can wear. They kind of determine how an element interacts with other elements. Okay, I kind of get it. So what are thallium's different costumes? Well, it's got a plus one state and a plus three state. Plus one and plus three, okay. And its plus three state, thallium acts kind of like its buddies in group 13 of the periodic table. You know, like boron and aluminum. Right, the boron group. But when it's in its plus one state, things get interesting. It's like it decides to go rogue and act more like an alkali metal. Specifically, it starts mimicking potassium. Mimicking potassium. Yeah, it tries to be like potassium. And that's actually where things get a little dangerous. Ah, now we're getting to the poison part. Yeah, exactly. Remember that Agatha Christie novel we mentioned, The Pale Horse? Oh, yeah. Well, that book actually features thallium poisoning as a key plot point. And she described the symptoms pretty accurately, didn't she? She did. It's actually kind of creepy how well she understood the effects of thallium poisoning. But you know, some people think that by writing about it so accurately, she actually helped raise awareness about how dangerous it is. That's interesting. It's like her fiction might have actually saved lives. Yeah, it's kind of wild to think about. Okay, so we know it's dangerous, but thallium is also super rare. It's not just lying around everywhere. So where do you even find it? Well, mostly you find it as a byproduct of refining those heavy metal sulfide ores. Oh, so it's kind of like a hidden treasure. Yeah, you could say that. And even the minerals where it's found have these really complex names, like crooksite. Crooksite, for William Crooks, I bet. Yep. And then there's Hutchinsonite and Lorandite. Those are some mouthful names. Right, it's like they knew this element was going to be a bit of a mystery. You know, I read that French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, he actually called thallium the duck-billed platypus of metals. The duck-billed platypus of metals. That's a weird comparison. Why did he say that? Well, think about it. The platypus is this totally unique creature. It's got features of both mammals and birds, right? Yeah, it's kind of an oddball. Exactly. And thallium is kind of the same way. It's got those two different oxidation states, so it can act like a metal from group 13 or like an alkali metal. It's unpredictable. So it's a rare bird, or should we say a rare platypus, of the periodic table. Uh-huh, exactly. Now, enough about its poisonous past. Let's move on to something a little more upbeat. Thallium has some really cool applications, even though we don't use it for rat poison anymore, thankfully. Oh, yeah. I read that it's used in electronics, optics, and even glassmaking. It's true. It's super versatile. So let's start with its use in electronics. Have you ever heard of photoresistors or bolometers? Um, I can't say that I have. Okay, well, photoresistors are used to control electrical circuits based on how much light is hitting them. Oh, interesting. So like a light sensor. Yeah, exactly. And then bolometers, they're used to measure infrared radiation. Infrared, huh? So that's heat. You got it. So what makes thallium so special for these devices is that its electrical conductivity changes when it's exposed to infrared light. Oh, I see. So it can detect those changes in infrared light. Yep. Pretty neat, right? Definitely. What about its use in optics? I saw something about KRS-5. What in the world is that? KRS-5. I know, it sounds like some kind of secret code, right? It does. Is it some kind of spy gadget? Ha ha, not quite. KRS-5 is actually the trade name for a special type of crystal. It's made from thallium bromide and iodide. Thallium bromide and iodide. Yeah, it's a mouthful. But the important thing is that these crystals are amazing at transmitting infrared wavelengths. So they're really useful for all sorts of infrared optics applications. Wow, so it's like a superpower for anything involving infrared light. Pretty much. Now let's talk about glass. You might not think that thallium and glass go together, but... I mean, I don't usually associate prasin with something I drink out of. Fair enough. But when you combine thallium with certain elements like sulfur, selenium, or arsenic, something amazing happens. What's that? You can create this special type of glass that has a really high refractive index. That means it bends light in a very specific way. Oh, okay. And what's even more interesting is that this glass has a really low melting point. We're talking somewhere between 125 and 150 degrees Celsius. Wait, that's way lower than normal glass. Right. And because it melts at such a low temperature, and it's also super durable and water resistant, it's perfect for making electronic parts and other special products. So it's like a super glass. Kind of. It allows you to do things with glass that you just couldn't do with regular glass. Now I know we've been talking about all these cool applications of thallium, but we can't forget that it's still a potentially hazardous element. Right. I mean, we don't use it in rat poison anymore, but there's still some environmental concerns we've got to think about. The EPA, they've identified a few sources of thallium pollution, and some of them are kind of surprising. Like what? Well, cement factories, for one. Cement factories. Really? Yeah. And also coal-burning power plants. That makes sense, I guess. And get this, even metal sewers can contribute to thallium pollution. Wow, I wouldn't have thought of that. Plus, there's the issue of leaching from ore processing operations. Leaching. Yeah, so basically thallium can seep out from the ores during processing and contaminate water sources. It's a serious issue. So even though we've moved on from using it as a poison, we still need to be really careful about how we handle thallium and dispose of it properly. It's a good reminder that even when we find beneficial uses for an element, we can't ignore its potential risks. You're absolutely right. Now, before we jump into thallium's role in nuclear medicine and the exciting world of high-temperature superconductors, let's take a quick breather and think about what we've learned so far. It's pretty incredible, right? Totally. It just blows my mind how one element can have such a diverse range of properties and applications. Me too. And we're just getting started. Thallium, huh? What a wild ride so far. But wait, there's more. More.
