## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. Today, we're going to be taking a deep dive into the reign of Salim, someone who really had an impact on the Ottoman Empire. Yeah. For only being sultan for eight years. It's pretty incredible. I mean, wow, eight years. That's a blink of an eye. Yeah. For having such a lasting legacy. Yeah, he's often overshadowed by his son, Suleiman the Magnificent. Right. But you can't understand Suleiman's success without Salim. Yeah, you got to have the foundation first. Exactly. And he kind of set the stage. So we've got excerpts today from his Wikipedia page, as well as a document called Salim A Conquest and Dynasty. Great. So let's jump right in. Yeah. So just to kind of set the stage here. Sure. Late 1400s, early 1500s. Yep. The Ottoman Empire is already a major power. That's right. But obviously there's tension. There's rivals on all sides. Uh-huh. And Salim's born right into this in 1470. Yeah. The son of Sultan Bayezid II. Yep. Pretty important guy. What's his upbringing? What shapes a guy like Salim? So he went through what every Ottoman prince would have gone through. Okay. Religious studies, military training, the whole nine yards. Okay. But it's really his time as the governor of Trabzon that, that seems to have really forged his personality. Okay. So Trabzon is on the Black Sea. Got it. And it was this really crucial outpost that was constantly facing threats. So not your typical kind of just cushy governorship? No, definitely not. This is where he's getting experience on the ground. Yeah. This is it. With the Safavids and with Shah Ismail, who is not someone to trifle with. A powerful guy. Yeah. It's right on that frontier zone between the two empires. Okay. And this is where Salim really honed his military skills and I think also started to understand the strategic importance of that eastern border. So then this experience is going to really become crucial when we have the succession crisis. Right. Because Salim's father favors another son as heir. That's right. Shahzadeh Ahmed. And you know, you would think most princes in that situation would grumble a bit, accept their fate. Sure. Not Salim. Not Salim. Tell me about it. So he decides to rebel against his father. Oh, wow. And it's the first time in Ottoman history that we've seen this. Really? Where a prince actually openly challenges the sultan with his own army. Talk about a family feud. Yeah, definitely shakes the foundations of the empire. So he wins the struggle. Does. Forces his father to abdicate. Takes the throne. That's right. And then you would think, okay, well, that's the end of it. Right. But he doesn't take chances, does he? No, he does not. He has a nickname, Salim the Grim. Yeah. Tell me how he earns that name. So he orders the execution of all of his brothers. Oh, wow. And his nephews. Eliminating any potential rivals to his throne. Wow. It's obviously a very brutal act. But it's something we see throughout history. Okay. Powerful dynasties. You got to remember that the stakes were very high. Yeah, absolutely. And so this sets the tone for his reign. What does this tell us about Salim, about his character? I think it shows us that he's incredibly ruthless, but also decisive. He doesn't want to leave anything up to chance. Right. He's willing to do whatever it takes to secure his power and achieve his goals. So then we've got this rivalry with the Safavids, which doesn't disappear just because he takes the throne. That's right. If anything, he's now in a position to act. Exactly. And this rivalry has a deep religious dimension to it as well. Oh, really? So the Ottomans are Sunni Muslims. Okay. The Safavids are Shia Muslims. Got it. So this isn't just a conflict over territory. It's a clash of ideologies. And it's really a struggle for religious dominance in the region. So you've got these two powerful empires. Yeah. Two ambitious rulers. That's right. This deep-seated religious conflict. So it all comes to a head at the Battle of Chaldoran in 1514. That's right. And this is where Salim's military genius comes to play. Yeah. And not only that, but the Ottomans have a technological advantage at this point. Okay. So they've really incorporated gunpowder weaponry into their army. So we're talking cannons, muskets, things that are really going to give them a huge advantage on the battlefield. Yeah, they have a lot of firepower. Wow. The Safavids haven't really caught up with this yet. Okay. So the result is an Ottoman victory. Decisive. Very decisive. Wow. Shah Ismail's forces are defeated and Salim is able to annex huge chunks of Safavid territory. Wow. It's a real turning point. Yeah. This victory has huge repercussions. It does. Not just for these two empires, but for the whole region. It really cements Ottoman dominance in Anatolia. Absolutely. And it opens up the path for his ambition to go even further south. It's a pivotal moment. Yeah. And I think it's also important to note that he wasn't just conquering territory. Okay. He was also a really great administrator. So he would implement policies to consolidate his control and really bring these new provinces firmly under Ottoman rule. So he's thinking for the long term. Definitely. This isn't just about brute force. It's about establishing lasting structures of power. So we've got Salim. Yeah. Fresh off this major victory. An empire that's growing in size and confidence. Absolutely. And as we just said, a leader who's thinking long term. Yes. So where does he turn his attention to next? So with the eastern front secure, at least for the time being, he sets his sights on another powerful enemy, the Mamluk Sultanate, which controls a huge area of territory from Syria down through Egypt. Now the Mamluks, they weren't a pushover. They had a really long history of military success, especially against the Crusaders. They were really known for their cavalry, their Mamluks, which were their elite slave soldiers. Got it. And controlling Egypt. I mean, they're sitting on a major trade route. Oh, absolutely. Between east and the Mediterranean. That's right. So this isn't just, you know, some side campaign. Yo, this is the big time. This is Salim taking on another major power. Absolutely. So he doesn't hesitate. Nope. Fresh off the victory in Sheldrin. Yeah. He's feeling good. He's feeling it. He's ready to go. Launches into this rapid and decisive campaign. That's right. So he was considered a brilliant military strategist. Is this where that strategic thinking that we talk about comes into play? Absolutely. I think his time in Trabzon was really influential because he learned the importance of speed and mobility. Right. So he keeps the Mamluks off balance. Okay. Doesn't let them regroup. Got it. Prevents them from mounting an effective defense. Smart. Leads his forces on these swift marches. Uh-huh. And this culminates in a big victory at the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516. So this battle is crucial because it breaks the back of Mamluk resistance in Syria. The Mamluk Sultan is killed. Oh, wow. And Salim's forces capture Damascus. Which is a major city. Oh, huge. A major prize. Absolutely. So it's a crushing defeat for the Mamluks. Yeah. And Salim, he presses his advantage. Okay. He doesn't let up. Right. Pushes further south. Engages the Mamluks again at the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517. Okay. Just outside of Cairo. Wow. And again, another decisive victory for Salim. So two years. Two years. He's conquered all this territory. It's incredible. The Ottoman Empire now stretches from the eastern borders of Anatolia. Uh-huh. All the way down through Egypt. Yeah. That's incredible. Militarily, logistically. I mean, just to keep everything moving and supplied. It's a huge testament to his leadership. Yeah. And the strength of the Ottoman Army. So, but these conquests, they have implications. Yes. For the Islamic world. Because now the Ottomans control Mecca and Medina. That's right. The two holiest cities in Islam. Huge ramifications. So does this make Salim the Caliph? That's the question, isn't it? Right. The successor to the Prophet Muhammad. Uh-huh. The leader of the Muslim world. Does he become that? Right. Because we know the last abased Caliph. Al-Mutawakil III. Was in Cairo. Right. Under Mamluk protection. And after the Ottomans conquer. He's taken to Istanbul. Okay. So it's not clear if there was a formal transfer of power. So some sources say there was a ceremony. Right. Some say it was made up later to kind of. To make the Ottomans look more legit. More legit. Yeah. So whether he formally claimed the title or not. Right. He controls those holy cities. He does. And he's the leader of the most powerful Sunni Muslim state. Uh-huh. So he's the most powerful figure in the Islamic world. Effectively, yes. So that's a huge turning point. It really is. For the Ottomans and for the whole region. It's going to shape the empire for centuries to come. So let's step back for a second. Okay. We've talked about Salim's
