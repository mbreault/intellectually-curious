## Description

Dive into the life of Joshua King, the 12th Lucasian Professor, who rose from Hawkshead to Cambridge but published only one paper. We examine his administrative impact at Queen's College and as vice chancellor, the cryptic remark I have done better things, and what his story suggests about what counts as success in academia.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. Today we're taking a deep dive into, well, it's a bit of a head-scratcher. We're looking at Joshua King, the 12th person to hold the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics. Yeah, you know, it's interesting when you think about that lineage, right? I mean, Newton, Babbage, Hawking, it's a pretty impressive group. It is. And on the surface, it looks like King fits right in. Born in 1798, he gets the Senior Wrangler title at Cambridge, you know, top math graduate of the year, right? Right. Then he becomes president of Queen's College, even served as vice chancellor of the whole university. But here's the thing. For all that, he published one mathematical paper. Just one his entire life. And it seems like he didn't give any lectures, at least none that we have a record of. It's really strange when you compare that to everyone else who held the Lucasian Chair, both before and after him. They were really active, you know, constantly publishing, constantly working. It's almost like he went out of his way to step back from math, even after it brought him so much success early on. So to understand this, I think we need to go back, right back to the beginning. Can you tell us a bit about his background, how he got to Cambridge? Sure. He started at Hawkshead Grammar School. Now, this is actually the same school that William Wordsworth went to, the poet. Interesting connection there. Oh, wow. I didn't realize that. Yeah. And after Hawkshead, he went to Trinity College, Cambridge initially, but then he moved to Queens as a siz. As a sizer. Now, for our listeners who might not be familiar, what exactly did that mean back then? Basically, it meant that he was getting financial help to study. But in return, he had to do certain jobs around the college. So right from the start, it sounds like there were some financial challenges, maybe. It's possible. And that makes becoming Senior Wrangler, I mean, even more impressive, right? Oh, absolutely. To do that in 1819, in that kind of environment, and it wasn't just being smart. It was ambition, drive, the whole package. And yet, and yet, this brilliant mind, it's like poof, disappears from mathematical research. There's this quote. It's from the Queen's College record. And they said, it was believed that nothing less than a second Newton had appeared. So his papers were examined and nothing whatever worth publishing was found. I mean, that really says it all, doesn't it? So much early promise, the potential to change math as we know it, and then nothing. It really is a mystery. It's almost like he just, I don't know, walked away from it all. And instead, he really threw himself into, well, the administrative side of things, the politics of university life. And he wasn't just there. He thrived. You know, he became the first president of Queen's College who wasn't a clergyman. That's a big deal, especially back then. It is. So maybe, and this is just me thinking out loud here, but maybe those kinds of roles, maybe they were more satisfying for him, more than, you know, just pure math. It's possible, right? I mean, running a college like Queen's, especially during a period when the whole university system was changing so much, that takes a different kind of brainpower. He wasn't solving equations. He was solving people problems, balancing budgets, making decisions that affected, well, everyone. So instead of, I don't know, wrestling with some theorem, he was wrestling with, what, faculty appointments? Student discipline? Exactly. But it's still problem-solving. It still requires a sharp mind, just a different kind of focus. And then there's his time as vice chancellor. That put him right at the center of everything, not just one college, but the whole university. Right, the whole ecosystem. Students, professors, research, the town, a lot to juggle. I bet. All that must have taken a ton of time. Do we know anything about how he was as a leader, what kind of impact he had, especially at Queen's? The records, they're pretty thin, unfortunately. But what we do have suggests that he was well-respected. Fair, good at smoothing things over when people disagreed. People said he genuinely cared about the college and the people in it. That's so interesting because it doesn't fit, you know, the stereotype of a mathematician. You know, off in their own world, not really paying attention to anything else. He was definitely engaged with the world around him, even if it wasn't through math, at least not directly. Which brings us back to that silence, that mathematical silence. If he was so capable, why did he stop? Was it a choice? Did he lose confidence, maybe? Or was it something else entirely? There's a quote. Well, it's more of an anecdote, really. People said that when he was asked about why he wasn't publishing anymore, he simply said, I have done better things. Better things. What could he possibly have meant by that? What could be better than, you know, pushing math forward, especially with the legacy of the Lucasian chair? It's cryptic, isn't it? It makes you think. Maybe the work at Queen's, the leadership roles, maybe those truly were more fulfilling for him. Or maybe he felt the pressure, you know, the weight of Newton, Babbage. Maybe he chose a path where he wasn't constantly being compared to them. It makes you think about what better even means in academia. Is it publications, discoveries, or is it about building institutions, mentoring people, you know, shaping the environment where all of that happens? Really good questions. I think King's life forces us to ask those questions, whether he meant to or not. We tend to think of success as this individual thing. But what if, like with King, success was about something bigger, about serving the institution as a whole? It's a different way of thinking about legacy, for sure. And it might be a legacy that's even more relevant now. Think about it. Academia, it's so focused on metrics, on individual achievement. But King reminds us there are other ways to make a difference. Sometimes the most important work happens behind the scenes. Makes you wonder how many other Joshua Kings are out there, right? Brilliant people who just, I don't know, took a different road. Maybe they're making an impact, but we just don't see it in the usual way. Yeah, that's a really interesting thought. Maybe his story is a reminder, you know, to look beyond just those traditional markers of success, to see how many different ways, well, intellect and creativity can shape things. So as we start to wrap up here, what are the key things we should remember about Joshua King? What can we learn from this very unusual path he took? I think the biggest takeaway is that he defies easy categorization, you know? He achieves the highest level of math success, you know, as a young man, and then he just, he seemingly shifts gears completely. He's a reminder that brilliance doesn't always follow a straight line, right? It can branch out, explore different things, find satisfaction in ways you might not expect. And for King, it seems like that satisfaction came from building institutions, you know? Being a mentor, his legacy, it might not be in some theorem or a list of publications, but in the lives he touched as president of Queens, as a leader in the university. A legacy that's, well, harder to measure, but just as important, right? It really raises the question, though, what would lead someone to walk away from their field like that, even from a position like the Lucasian Professorship? Is it a story about potential wasted, or is it something more, something about the nature of intellectual curiosity? It's definitely something to think about. It tells us that even the most accomplished people, they have their own complexities, their own choices to make, their own paths not taken. Joshua King, he's a mystery, for sure. But he gives us a glimpse into how talent, well, how it can shape the world in so many ways. Absolutely. Thanks for joining us for this deep dive into the life of Joshua King. Maybe his story will, well, maybe it'll make you think about what success really means, both in academia and just in life.
