## Description

From a train-loving kid who built a working computer from an old TV to the inventor of the World Wide Web, this episode traces Tim Berners-Lee's journey. We explore the CERN-scale problems that sparked the web, his choice to give it away, and the ongoing mission to keep the internet open. We also look at modern efforts like SOLID and Inrupt that put users back in control of their data and safeguard a free, interoperable web for everyone.

## Transcript

Alright, so get this. You sent us a Wikipedia article on Tim Berners-Lee. Seems simple enough, right? Yeah. Inventor of the World Wide Web. We all know that story. Right. Or do we? That's the question, isn't it? There's always more to these stories. Like, you think you know Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the web, right? Right. But did you know he was a total train nerd growing up? And get this, he built a working computer out of an old TV. No way! A regular computer? Yeah, like a real one. It's kind of amazing. Even as a kid, you see this tendency to tinker. Not just observing, but taking things apart, figuring out how they work. So not just watching trains go by, but like taking them apart in his mind. Exactly. Like, how do these things work? And then how can I make something new with them? It's a recurring theme with Berners-Lee. It's mind-blowing when you think about it, right? I mean, here's Timbo just trying to share some documents with his buddies at CERN, and bam! He accidentally invents the backbone of the modern world. He's actually pretty frustrated with how difficult it was to share information at CERN back then. I mean, it's the late 1980s, one of the world's leading physics labs, but their information sharing was, well, a bit chaotic. I bet that was a recipe for desperation, which is exactly how Berners-Lee described the creation of the web. Which, I mean, that doesn't exactly scream visionary inventor, does it? It's so true. You have to remember, he wasn't trying to build an empire or anything, just trying to solve a very practical problem. Hundreds of researchers, each with their own data, their own systems, their own way of doing things. Berners-Lee just wanted to streamline things, make it easier for everyone to access and share information. And so, he starts tinkering, combining existing technologies like hypertext and TCP IP, and boom, the World Wide Web is born. Amazing, really. And it makes you think, right? What small problems today might hold the seeds of the next big technological revolution? It's like that saying, necessity is the mother of invention. Except, in this case, it was the mother of, well, everything we do online today. Speaking of tinkering and inventions, you won't believe this little detail about web addresses that even Tim Berners-Lee himself has admitted was probably unnecessary. But we'll save that juicy tidbit for after the break. Okay, so before the break, we were talking about those little quirks that even brilliant minds like Tim Berners-Lee look back on and think, huh, what was I thinking? Yeah, those little details that seem so small at the time but can really snowball, you know? Especially in tech. Those quirks, they end up shaping how we interact with technology for years, sometimes even decades. It's true, yeah. Case in point, those two forward slashes in web addresses, those after the HTTPS that we all type in without even, like, thinking about it. Turns out even Tim Berners-Lee has admitted they were probably unnecessary. No way, really? Yeah, he's even jokingly apologized for them. You apologized? That's hilarious. I never knew that. So give us the inside scoop. Did we really need those slashes or was it just a cosmic typo that we're now stuck with for all eternity? Well, you gotta remember the context, right? In the early days of the web, Berners-Lee wasn't building everything from scratch. He was building on top of existing systems. And those slashes, they were just a part of how computers identified machines and files on a network back then. Ah, so it was like a necessary evil back then. Not even necessarily evil. More like a structural leftover. He could have designed a system without them, sure. But those slashes were just part of the language of networks at the time. It's kind of like how we still use the QWERTY keyboard even though everyone knows there are more efficient layouts out there. Sometimes those early design choices, they just stick. Yeah, inertia is a powerful force, especially in tech. And now we're all stuck with those double slashes until the end of the internet as we know it. But hey, at least they've become like a familiar landmark in the digital world. But you know what's even more fascinating than those slashes? The path not taken? The decision that could have made Tim Berners-Lee one seriously rich dude? Oh yeah, this is where things get really interesting. We've talked about how he didn't set out to create some world-changing technology, but here's the real kicker. Once he did, he made a decision that was even more remarkable. He chose to give it away. Wait, hold on. You're telling me he could have been rolling in cash, like Mark Zuckerberg style, but he just didn't. It's true. Think about it. He could have patented the technology, charged licensing fees for every browser and website, built a whole empire around it. The guy could have been richer than Bezos. Talk about a missed opportunity, right? See, that's the thing. It wasn't a missed opportunity for Tim Berners-Lee. He had a different vision. He really believed that for the web to reach its full potential, it had to be open and accessible to everyone. Wow. So he basically said, this isn't about the money, this is about building a more connected world. I mean, it really makes you think, what would the internet look like today if he had gone the other way? It's a question worth pondering, that's for sure. Would we even have the internet as we know it? Would it be this open, interconnected network of information or something more fragmented, more tightly controlled? Who knows? It's kind of chilling to imagine a world where every click comes with a price tag, where accessing information is a luxury, not a right. Thankfully, Tim Berners-Lee had other plans. It was a profoundly democratic vision when you really think about it. And it's something we often take for granted today, this idea that the basic building blocks of the web are open and freely available to anyone with an internet connection. But it was a choice, a deliberate rejection of that traditional model of technological innovation that's always driven by profit above all else. Makes you appreciate those double slashes a little more, doesn't it? They might be a quirk, but they're a quirk of a web that's free and open to everyone thanks to Tim Berners-Lee. But his story doesn't end there. Up next, we'll dive into what Sir Tim, because yes, he's a knight, is up to these days. And spoiler alert, he's still fighting to keep the internet open and accessible for all. We're back and ready to unpack with Sir Tim because, yes, he's a knight, is up to these days. Sir Tim, I love it. Right, because let's face it, after inventing the World Wide Web, most people would be, like, sipping lemonade on a beach somewhere. But not our Tim at all. This guy is still hard at work. It's true. Berners-Lee has actually expressed concerns about the direction the internet has taken in recent years. Really? Yeah. Despite giving the web away, he's still fighting to keep it open and accessible, just in a different way now. He's become a huge advocate for net neutrality, pushing back against these attempts to create a two-tiered internet with the big players get all the advantages. So instead of, you know, resting on his laurels, he's out there battling to keep the internet a level playing field. That's pretty remarkable. What is it, do you think, that keeps him motivated at this point in the game? I mean, the guy's already changed the world once. Well, for Berners-Lee, I think it's about more than just the technology. Those early principles of an open and accessible internet, those are fundamental, not just for the web itself, but for the kind of world we want to live in. He's also really deeply involved in these projects that aim to, like, shift the power dynamic online, putting users back in control of their own data. Now that's something I think we can all get behind. Data privacy is a huge, heat deal these days. What kind of projects are we talking about? So one that I find really fascinating is called SOLID, which stands for Social Linked Data. It's basically a completely different approach to how we store and interact with all of our data online. Okay, I'm intrigued. Break it down for us. What's the big idea behind SOLID? Okay, so think about it. Right now, your digital life, it's scattered, right? Social media profiles, your online shopping, health records, it's all controlled by these different companies, locked away in their own little silos. SOLID wants to change that by basically giving you a single space to store all your data, like one place for everything, and you control it. So it's like a digital lockbox for your entire online identity. Exactly. So you decide who gets access to what instead of these big companies calling all the shots. Exactly, and it gets even better. It's built on these open standards, just like the original web, which means it's not owned or controlled by any one company. In fact, Berners-Lee actually started a company called Inrupt to help accelerate its development and get it into the hands of everyday users. This is why I love these deep dives. We started with a Wikipedia article on Tim Berners-Lee, and now we're talking about the future of the internet. It's actually pretty inspiring when you think about it. This guy who invented the web, he's still out there fighting the good fight, trying to make it a better, more equitable space for all of us. Absolutely. And,
