## Description

Step back to medieval England, where hundreds chased a ball through crowded town squares with few rules. This episode untangles how Shrovetide games served as a social safety valve, how kings, poets, and clergy weighed in, and how chaotic, rule-light mob football gradually evolved into organized rules and leaguesâ€”the beating heart of the modern sport.

## Transcript

Ever get that feeling, you know, like modern sports, even with the big hits and the crazy plays, are still kind of held back? Hmm, I see what you mean. Like, we're going to look back at a time when, well, let's just say sportsmanship wasn't exactly a top priority. Oh, this is going to be good. Medieval football, right? You got it. Talk about a contact sport. We're diving into the world of medieval football, and our main source is, well, it's Wikipedia. Wikipedia. Don't underestimate it. Never! And the article on medieval football, let me tell you, it's a treasure trove. So get ready, because by the time we're done with this deep dive, you'll see how this ancestor of, you know, soccer, rugby, the whole lot, it's a reflection of a society grappling with, like, order and chaos. Fascinating stuff. Picture this, right? England in the Middle Ages. But forget the knights and castles for a sec. Think hundreds of players, one massive free-for-all for a ball, and basically zero rules. They didn't call it mob football for nothing. And mob, that wasn't just, like, a catchy name. What's wild is that scoring goals, at least how we think of them, not really the point. These games were more like pressure releases for society. Especially during holidays, right? Like Shrovetide. Exactly. Shrovetide boomed the town squares of battlefield. Everyone crammed in, fighting for this ball. And when I say ball, I mean, could be anything. A stitched leather ball, sure. Or, get this, an inflated pig bladder. Now that's what I call pigskin. You gotta wonder how many injuries those games ended with. Oh, you'd be surprised. Or maybe not. We're talking broken bones, brawls, even deaths weren't unheard of. Medieval life. Structured, man. Rigid social hierarchy, the whole bit. Shrovetide football. As brutal as it seems to us, it was an outlet. A chance to break free from all that, you know, even if just for the game. It makes you think, like, a simple game, but it was this safety valve for society. What was going through King Edward II's head when he banned it in London back in 1314? Was he just worried about the violence, or was there something more to it? It's a good question. It's easy to see the violence and be like, yeah, safety first, makes sense. But Edward's reign. Not exactly smooth sailing. England's dealing with rebellions, economic woes, the works. And banning a sport known for getting out of hand. Maybe it was about more than just a few bruises. So Edward II, maybe he wasn't just being a killjoy. But man, trying to ban a sport people love, that never really works, does it? Not a chance. Football. It's got staying power. We see bans popping up all over the place throughout history. Makes you wonder if those in charge, maybe, just maybe, they were on to something, huh? That's the thing about history, right? Like sneaking a peek behind the curtain. And what we find, these little glimpses into everyday life, even the games they played, it's amazing. Speaking of glimpses, what about those little breadcrumbs we find scattered through history? I'm talking poems, diary entries, even church sermons mentioning football. Historians live for those breadcrumbs. Take that 13th century poem about, get this, little St. Hugh of Lincoln. Early, early mention of kicking the ball in an English game. You're telling me there's football history in a poem about a saint? You learn something new every day. Right. It shows you, football wasn't just for the common folk. The elites knew about it, even if they weren't always playing. Remember King Henry VIII? Dude had custom football dudes made. Talk about fit for a king. But something tells me he wasn't out there in the mud with everyone else. Probably not. But still, makes you wonder, right? Behind closed doors, maybe even royalty enjoyed a good kick about. Of course, not everyone was a fan. That's Sir Thomas Elliot, big-time scholar, called football beastly in his book back in 1531. Beastly. Sounds like someone needed a nap. Okay, but really, was it that bad? Well, Elliot, he was all about archery. Disciplined, skillful, that was his thing. So, medieval football, no real rules, it probably seemed like the total opposite. Early example of people having strong opinions about sports and their place in society, you know? Makes you think, are we really that different today? Arguing over which sport is better, tougher. But back to football. It wasn't all chaos and pig bladders, right? At some point, it started becoming the sport we know. It did. And we see signs, even in those early centuries. There's that Miser Record carving from Gloucester Cathedral. It shows a ball game, but with a much smaller ball. Not those giant mob footballs. Maybe different versions, even rules, starting to pop up. So it wasn't just one giant scrum. Fascinating. Nope. And get this, 1363, King Edward III. He makes a distinction, official-like, between football and handball. That's big. It means they're recognizing they need rules to separate the games. Like they're starting to think, hey, maybe a little organization isn't so bad. But you know what they say about old habits. Die hard. Especially with a sport as, let's say, lively as football. Exactly. But then, 16th, 17th centuries, things get really interesting. Richard Carew, 1602. He's writing about Cornish hurling. Manchins goals, but get this, they're marked by bushes. And players, their job is to guard those goals. Okay, hold on. Bushes as goalposts. I've got to admit, that's a pretty fantastic image. But goalkeepers, now we're talking, it's like we're seeing the first bits of, you know, real football strategy. It's wild to think even with goals and, you know, goalkeepers, those old school mob football games were still going strong in parts of England. Didn't we run across something called camp ball? We did, yeah. Camp ball, big in East Anglia. They had this crazy setup where the goals could be, like, miles apart. Miles, seriously. Seriously. Picture a game, it's part football, part rugby, part capture the flag. Now, that's what I call a workout. It really shows you just how much people loved that chaos, that anything goes style of play. But I got to imagine, 19th century rolls around, England's changing. A game with hundreds of people running across the countryside, no rules. That had to be, well, a little impractical. You think. Think about it. Industrial revolution, cities growing, and suddenly everyone's obsessed with order, control, those shrove tide games. They were part of rural life, and that life, it was disappearing. Not to mention trying to have a giant mob football match in the middle of a city. Right. Talk about a traffic jam. Yeah. And then, 1835, that's when they passed the Highway Act. No more football on public roads. That was the beginning of the end for that old wild way of playing. Kind of sad, isn't it? The end of an era. But football didn't disappear. It just transformed. Exactly. That's when we see the game we know take shape. Real rules, leagues. Football went from this free-for-all to, well, a sport. It's pretty incredible when you think about it. We started with muddy fields and bushes for goalposts, and now look. It's a global phenomenon. But under all the fancy stadiums and, you know, everything, we still see that connection to those medieval games. It all comes back to that basic human need to play, to compete, to just kick a ball around. And that, that's awesome. Couldn't agree more. So next time you're watching a match, take a second. Remember those medieval players. They didn't have fancy shoes or playbooks, but they had passion. And they definitely played a game that was anything but tame. That's for sure. This has been a blast from the past. Thanks for joining us for this deep dive into the rowdy and surprisingly fascinating history of medieval football.
