## Transcript

Welcome to another deep dive. Today we are going to be talking about the element nobelium. Nobelium is pretty cool, right? I've heard of it, but I don't really know much about it. Well, that is what we're here for, to dive deep. Perfect. So where should we start? I know it's one of the heavier elements on the periodic table. That's right. It is number 102. It is way down there, past uranium. So it's one of those transuranium elements. Yep, the transuranium element. I remember hearing those are pretty special. Yeah. The thing about those transuranium elements is they don't just exist naturally. Oh, right. Like you can't dig them up out of the ground or anything? Exactly. You have to make... How do you even do that? You smash other atoms together really, really fast and hope that some of them fuse. So like an atomic car crash? Pretty much. Yeah. Scientists use these massive machines called particle accelerators to get the atoms up to insane speeds. So they just load up the particle accelerator with like a bunch of atoms and fire away? Well, it's a bit more complicated than that. You have to choose the right ingredients, the right atoms to smash together. So for nobelium, what are the magic ingredients? One way to make it is to use californium-249 and carbon-12. Okay, so you take those atoms, you get them going super fast in the particle accelerator and bam, nobelium. Well, not quite bam. It's actually incredibly difficult to get the atoms to fuse. It's like trying to hit a bullseye from miles away. So even with all that technology, it's still kind of a long shot. It is. Even if you do everything right, the chances of creating nobelium are still pretty small. Wow. Talk about a needle in a haystack. But let's say they do get lucky and those atoms fuse. What happens next? How do they even know they've made nobelium? That's where things get really interesting. They have to study how the nobelium decays. Right, because it's radioactive, right? Exactly. Nobelium-255, the isotope we were just talking about, has a half-life of just over three minutes. Right, three minutes. So that means half of it disappears in just three minutes? Yep, pretty much. It decays into other elements. So scientists have to work really fast to study it before it vanishes. That's one of the biggest challenges with researching nobelium. It's a constant race against time. Three minutes, that's insane. So how do they actually study something that disappears that quickly? It's all about analyzing what's left behind, the radioactive fingerprint, you could say. By looking at what it decays into and the energy released during decay, scientists can confirm they did indeed create nobelium. So it's like a detective story using those clues to piece together what happened? Exactly. But nobelium's story isn't just about science. There's a fascinating human drama behind its discovery. Oh, do tell. I love a good science rivalry. Well, back in the 50s and 60s, the Cold War was in full swing. And there was this intense competition between the US and the Soviet Union, not just in space, but in science too. So nobelium became another front in the Cold War. You could say that. Multiple labs around the world were racing to create new elements, and nobelium was a prime target. So who was the first to claim victory in this atomic race? A team in Sweden actually announced they had created nobelium in 1957. They even proposed the name nobelium, which obviously stuck. But there's a twist. A twist? Ooh, I love twists. What happened? Well, it turns out they were probably mistaken. Later analysis suggested they might have misidentified another element, thorium-225. Oh, no. So a false start. Yep. And with that, the race was back on. So who took the lead after that? Two main contenders emerged. A group at Berkeley, led by, you guessed it, Albert Gyorso and Glenn Seaborg. Wow, Seaborg himself. That's like the scientific dream team. It was a big deal. And their competition was a team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, in the Soviet Union. So the Cold War rivalry was playing out at the atomic level. Pretty much. And to make things even more complicated, they were using different methods to try and create nobelium. Imagine two chefs trying to make the same cake using completely different recipes and ovens. Oh, wow. That's a recipe for disaster, or at least a lot of confusion. Exactly. There were conflicting results, claims and counterclaims flying back and forth. It took decades to sort it all out. So who ultimately won bragging rights? Well, in 1992, IUPAC, the organization responsible for naming elements, finally decided to officially credit the Dubna team with the discovery. So the Soviets got the win. They did. Their experiments from 1966 were deemed the most conclusive. But we kept the Swedish name, nobelium. Yeah, by that point, the name had become so widely used that changing it would have just caused more confusion. Right. That makes sense. So creating nobelium was a huge achievement, full of scientific drama and international rivalry. But now I'm curious, what's so special about nobelium beyond just the challenge of making it? Well, nobelium has a bit of a rebellious streak. It doesn't always follow the rules you'd expect based on where it sits on the periodic table. Tell me more. I love a good rebel. So you know how elements in the same column of the periodic table tend to have similar properties? Yeah, like they're kind of like families, right? Right. And based on nobelium's position in the actinide series, you'd expect it to behave like its siblings and prefer to be in what we call a plus three oxidation state. Okay, remind me what an oxidation state is again. I remember it has something to do with electrons, but... Sure. Imagine each atom as a tiny social butterfly, always looking to make connections by sharing electrons. Okay, I can picture that. So the oxidation state tells you how many electrons an atom has gained or lost in those social interactions. So plus three means it's lost three electrons. Exactly, which usually makes it more positively charged, so to speak. Okay, I think I'm following. So most actinides prefer to lose three electrons and hang out as plus three ions. Right, but nobelium likes to do things its own way. It prefers a plus two oxidation state. So nobelium is a rule breaker. Why is that? It all comes down to some pretty mind-bending physics called relativistic effects. Basically, when you get to elements as heavy as nobelium with so many protons and electrons, things start to get really weird. Well, the electrons are moving so ridiculously fast that they actually gain mass, and that changes how they interact with the nucleus. Wait, the electrons gain mass? Isn't that like Einstein's theory of relativity stuff? I thought that was for like black holes and stuff, not atoms. It's all connected. Relativity affects everything, even tiny electrons. Wow, that's mind-blowing. Right, so these super speedy, mass-boosted electrons in nobelium end up making the plus two state more stable than the plus three. So nobelium's rebellious nature is actually a consequence of Einstein's theory of relativity. That's an aha moment I wasn't expecting today. It's a fascinating example of how physics and chemistry are intertwined, especially when we get to these extreme elements. This is already so much more interesting than I thought it would be. And we've only just scratched the surface of nobelium's story. We've got a lot more ground to cover. Next, we're going to take a closer look at the structure of a nobelium atom and the ingenious techniques scientists use to study something that disappears in minutes. Okay, I'm ready. Let's dive in. All right, so we're going deeper into nobelium. We're going right into the atom itself. Sounds good. So we know atoms have a nucleus, right? Protons, neutrons, all that. Right. But what about the electrons? How are those arranged? Well, you can't forget about those electrons. They're not just randomly floating around. Right, I remember those electron shell diagrams from chemistry class. All those rings and numbers. Yeah, exactly. Each electron in nobelium has its assigned spot based on its energy level, like a well-organized dance floor, you know? So like each electron has its own specific energy and location? Yep, it's all very precise. And with 102 electrons, nobelium's electron configuration gets pretty complex. 102 electrons? Wow. So how do scientists figure out where all those electrons go? They use what we know from the periodic table, along with some pretty complex calculations. It's like solving a giant Sudoku puzzle. Okay, so what's the solution to the nobelium electron puzzle? Well, we think it's something called RN5F147S2. Whoa. Okay, that's a lot of letters and numbers. I know, it looks intimidating. But it's just a shorthand way to describe the arrangement. So can you decode that for me? Of course. The RN part is a shortcut. It represents the electron configuration of radon, a noble gas. Okay, so radon has 86 electrons. So are you saying that the first 86 electrons in nobelium are arranged the same way as in radon? Exactly. It's like nobelium starts with radon's stable electron structure and then builds from there. Okay, that's a good starting point. 86 down, 16 to go.
