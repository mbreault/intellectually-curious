A mindâ€‘bending dive into Nikolai Kardashevâ€™s energyâ€‘based ladderâ€”from Type I planetary civilizations to Type III galactic mastery (and beyond to speculative Type IV). Weâ€™ll trace the ideas, explore megastructures and microâ€‘engineering, and tackle the Fermi paradox: given a vast, ancient cosmos, why havenâ€™t we heard or seen signs of other intelligent lifeâ€”and what clues might guide our search?

## Transcript

Ever really stopped and thought about like how unbelievably huge the universe actually is? Like really try to picture just stars on stars and then galaxies stretching way further than we can even wrap our heads around. It kind of makes you wonder, right? About what else could be out there. That's incredible, isn't it? And that's exactly where we're headed on today's deep dive. We're going to unpack this mind-blowing idea, the Kardashev scale. It's basically a way to try and classify how advanced civilizations out there in the cosmos could possibly become. And to help me navigate this whole thing, I've got our expert here with us. Hi. So to kick things off, can you give us a quick rundown? What exactly is the Kardashev scale and who came up with this whole concept anyway? Right, so the Kardashev scale, super interesting stuff, was actually thought up by a Soviet astronomer guy named Nikolai Kardashev. And way back in 1964, he was already trying to figure out this question that still kind of blows our minds today. It's like, how could we even start looking for alien civilizations? You know, with this gigantic universe. And on top of that, how could we even begin to categorize them, you know, based on how good their technology is? Right. So Kardashev had this big idea. He figured, why not focus on energy? It's basically what makes any technological society tick. Yeah, makes sense. The more energy a civilization can use, the more advanced they'd have to be just to wrangle all that power. So it's kind of like a cosmic measuring stick for how advanced they are. Exactly. That's the beauty of this scale. It's so simple, but it totally works. It basically says the more energy a civilization can harness, the better their tech is going to be. And because of that, their whole civilization would have to be way more advanced too. So we're talking about like manipulating entire planets, stars even. Oh yeah, even galaxies. It's pretty mind blowing. It's definitely a lot to take in. So let's break it down a bit. What kind of insane advancements are we talking about at each level of this Kardashev scale? All right, so Kardashev, when he first thought this up, he outlined three main types of civilizations. Type I, the most basic type, is what you'd call a planetary civilization. These guys, they've totally mastered using all the energy that's available on their home planet. Hold on a sec. Are we talking like controlling volcanoes and earthquakes, even like the weather? Yeah. Because that's some serious sci-fi stuff right there. You got it. Type I civilizations, they'd have technology that would seem like straight out of a movie to us. Imagine a world where they've completely figured out natural disasters, completely a thing of the past. Where they're using every bit of renewable energy they can squeeze out of their planet. Wow. Now, just to give you an idea where we stand, humans, even with all our fancy gadgets and gizmos, we haven't quite hit that level yet. So where does that put us on the scale? Are we like a type 0.5 civilization, still messing around with the light switch? Well, Carl Sagan, you know the famous astronomer. Yeah, yeah. He actually came up with a more, shall we say, granular version of this scale back in the 70s. Okay. And based on his math, humanity was somewhere around a type 0.7 back then. We've definitely made some progress since, I'll give us that. But we're still a ways away from being a true type I civilization. It's a little humbling. But also kind of exciting. Like we've got a lot of room to grow still. Definitely. But let's talk about those civilizations that have moved past the beginner levels, you know? What's a type II civilization like? Because that's got to be where things get really interesting. Now, type II, this is where things get seriously mind-blowing. We're talking about a civilization that can harness the energy of its entire star. Wait a second. So you're saying they could build something that could actually, like, cover a whole star? It's crazy, right? I mean, how is that even possible? We're talking mega structures here. Stuff that completely dwarfs anything we can even dream of building right now. Things like Dyson swarms, which would be millions, maybe even billions of mirrors or solar panels all orbiting their star, catching every single photon of energy it blasts out. Wow. And with that kind of power, they could basically fuel entire planets, easily travel between star systems. I mean, the things they could do, it's just mind-boggling. Okay, I need a second to process that. Harnessing the power of a whole star. That's insane. That's just on another level. But I know there's more, right? What about type III civilizations? Those are the ones that make even a type II look tiny. Oh, absolutely. So, like, what can they do? It's almost impossible to grasp. We're talking about civilizations that have gone from a single star to, get this, controlling the energy output of a whole galaxy. That's billions upon billions of stars under their control. Wow. That's the realm of a type III civilization. And what they could accomplish at that level, well, it kind of boggles the mind. So we're talking civilizations that could move stars around, like rearrange them, maybe even mess with the fabric of space-time itself. I mean, is there anything they couldn't do? Think about it. Their engineering would be on a scale we can't even comprehend. Imagine being able to rearrange stars to, like, create the perfect energy sources. Or even building stuff around supermassive black holes to tap into their crazy gravitational energy. It's mind-blowing. I know, right? And those are just the ideas we can come up with. The civilizations that advanced, they've probably thought of stuff we can't even dream up. It really does make you wonder, are there any limits? Given enough time, I mean. That's the million-dollar question, isn't it? And it's something people have been debating ever since Kardashev came up with this scale. Some people have even gone beyond his original three types. Yay. Trying to imagine, you know, what could be even more advanced than a type III. What could be more advanced than controlling a galaxy? Would they be messing around with other universes? That's getting into some wild territory. But there are some interesting theories out there. Take physicist Michio Kaku, for example. Okay. He's the one who suggested adding a type IV. A type IV. Okay, and what can they do? These guys would be able to harness energy, not just from one galaxy, but from multiple galaxies. Wow. Maybe even the entire universe. Whoa. Okay, now we're talking about civilizations that make even type IIIs look like amateurs. But how would that even work? Would they be messing with, like, dark energy? Maybe controlling how the universe expands? That's the kind of scale we're talking about with type III. And Kaku takes it even further. How so? He connects this level of advancement to this idea of, get this, a knowledge economy. A knowledge economy. Okay, interesting. He argues that once a civilization reaches that level, they're no longer focused on physical resources like we are. They've moved on to knowledge and information. That's their main thing. Which, I mean, it makes sense. If you can bend the laws of physics, who needs gold or oil? Right? Exactly. Knowledge would be the most valuable thing. Absolutely. And it's not just about energy, either. There's this guy, Robert Zubrin. Okay. He's big on Mars colonization. He has a different take on what comes after type III. He focuses on resource mastery, being able to use stuff across huge distances of space. Okay. So instead of just looking at how much energy they use, it's about what they're doing with it. How they're shaping the universe around them. Exactly. Think about, like, terraforming planets, mining entire asteroids, even building structures so big they make solar systems look tiny. Wow. It's like the universe is their playground. Pretty much. And then there's John D. Barrow. He's a cosmologist, and he took things in a completely different direction. He came up with this thing called the anti-Kardashev scale. The anti-Kardashev scale. What is that? Yeah? Instead of going bigger and bigger with energy and expansion, he asked, what if a civilization got super advanced by mastering the very small? Like, imagine a civilization that can manipulate atoms, subatomic particles, even space-time itself. So instead of building megastructures, they're going inward, exploring the universe at its tiniest level. Exactly. They're like the ultimate micro-engineers. That's wild. It's like you've got these galaxy-spanning civilizations on one hand and then these tiny universe-probing ones on the other. Right. Talk about a cosmic pick-your-own-adventure. And it just shows you there could be tons of different ways for intelligence and technology to evolve. Absolutely. Not just the ways we can imagine based on, you know, our own limited experience. It's both humbling and mind-blowing at the same time. But here's the thing that gets me. If these super civilizations are out there, why haven't we seen any evidence of them? Well, now you've hit on one of the biggest head-scratchers in our search for life beyond Earth, the Fermi paradox. Right, the Fermi paradox. Explain that to me again. I've heard of it, but I'm not totally sure I get it. Basically, it's this. The universe is enormous, right? Right. And old, billions of years old. Okay. So it's teeming with stars and probably tons of habitable planets. So given all that, why haven't we heard from anyone
