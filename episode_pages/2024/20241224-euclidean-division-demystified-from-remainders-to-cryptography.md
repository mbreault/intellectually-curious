## Description

We explore Euclidean division beyond grade-school remainders, why the quotient and remainder are unique, and how the Euclidean algorithm finds the gcd. We'll walk through concrete steps (e.g., gcd(980, 78)) and connect these ideas to modular arithmetic and real-world tech like cryptography and signal processing, with a nod to polynomial division where the rules differ.

## Transcript

Welcome back. It's time for another deep dive into number theory. Always fun to dive back into this. Definitely. Last time we were looking at those amazing prime numbers. Right. This time we're going to tackle something that might seem a little bit basic at first. Okay. Euclidean division. You know, I think most people might remember that from like grade school as division with a remainder. Right. But we're going to go way beyond that. Yeah, there's a lot more to it. Yeah. It's got some pretty deep implications, actually, even for like, you know, STEM folks out there. Absolutely. So to help us unpack this, we're using a couple of sources. We've got an excerpt from the Wikipedia page on Euclidean division, and we've also got a BYJU learning resource. And this one is about Euclid's division lemma. Okay. So to set the stage, we all know Euclidean division. It's about dividing integers. Yeah. And we get a quotient and a remainder. Exactly. So it's like, you know, simple example, nine divided by four. Okay. We get a quotient of two and a remainder of one. Right. But the really interesting thing is that the quotient and the remainder, they're unique. Oh, okay. And that's not something that we always emphasize enough, I think, in basic math. Uh-huh. But that's what makes Euclidean division so powerful. So it's not just the dividing and getting a quotient and a remainder. Right. It's the fact that those two things, the quotient and remainder are unique. Precisely. That leads to, well, I'm guessing some pretty powerful stuff. Exactly. What kind of stuff? Well, so it applied in so many fields, cryptography, computer science. Okay. And, you know, you mentioned this earlier, but the Wikipedia article actually mentions the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor. Oh, the GCD. The GCD, right? Okay. Biggest common factor that divides two given numbers without leaving a remainder. So that's used in a lot of different areas, right? I remember like simplifying fractions. Simplifying fractions, absolutely. And then cryptography, as you mentioned. That's right. Really important concept. And they're specifically saying that the Euclidean algorithm is built on Euclidean division. It is, yeah. So how does that work? How is an algorithm for finding the biggest common factor related to this simple division with a remainder? Well, the BYJU piece does a really great job of breaking it down. Essentially, it leverages Euclid's division lemma, which is, I guess, you know, the formal way of stating this whole concept. And it uses it repeatedly. So it applies division to the divisor and the remainder from the previous step. Oh, okay. And the last non-zero remainder that you get, that's your GCD. Oh, okay. So they have a good example in there of finding the GCD of 980 and 78. Oh, perfect. Should we walk through that? Yeah, let's do it. Okay. So you start by dividing 980 by 78. Okay. That gives you a quotient of 12 and a remainder of 44. Now, instead of focusing on the 980 and 78, we shift our attention to 78 and 44. We divide 78 by 44. Okay. You get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 34. So we just keep doing this over and over again? Exactly, yeah. With the new numbers. Yep. Okay. So next you divide 44 by 34. Okay. Quotient of 1, remainder of 10. Then 34 by 10, quotient of 3, remainder of 4. Okay. Continue, divide 10 by 4. It gives you a quotient of 2, remainder of 2. Okay. And finally, you divide 4 by 2 and that gives you a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0. Zero. So we're done. Yeah. And the GCD is 2, the last divisor. Exactly. It's pretty neat. It's an elegant process, isn't it? Yeah, it is. It's kind of cool to see how it all, like, unfolds step by step. Yeah. The Wikipedia article also mentions modular arithmetic. Oh, yeah. Can you remind me what that is again? Sure. So think of a clock face. Okay. It's a cycle of 12 hours. When we go past 12, we start over from 1. Right. That's modular arithmetic in action. Okay. Essentially, it deals with remainders after division. The remainder becomes our answer in the modular world. Okay. And Euclidean division, with its emphasis on the unique remainder, it forms the basis of this whole branch of math. So, like, if we say 15 is congruent to 3 modulo 12. Right. We're saying they both have the same remainder when you divide by 12. Exactly. And that's used in cryptography, computer science, all sorts of things. So this is definitely more complicated than just simple division. Yeah. I mean, it's all based on it, but it gets pretty complex pretty fast. It really does. The Wikipedia article also, like, lays out the theorem itself formally. Right. It says, for any two integers, A, which is the dividend, and B, which is the divisor, and B can't be 0. Right. There exist unique integers, Q for quotient and R for remainder, such that A equals B times Q plus R. Exactly. And so they also make a point of saying that the remainder, it's always non-negative. Right. And it's strictly less than the absolute value of B. Yes. Very important. So, like, in our 9 divided by 4 example. Yeah. It would be 9 equals 4 times 2 plus 1. Exactly. So we've got our dividend is 9, our divisor is 4, quotient is 2, and our remainder is 1, which is less than 4. Yeah. Perfect example. Okay, so we've got the basic concept. Right. We kind of get how it's important. Yeah. But why should someone who's not like, you know, a mathematician care about this? Like, what's the real world? That's a great question. Relevance. Yeah, so that leads us into some of the practical applications of this, you know, seemingly abstract concept. So, like, we talked about cryptography briefly. Right. How does Euclidean division play a role in, like, keeping my information secure online? Okay, well, imagine you're sending a secret message online. Okay. You want to make sure only the intended recipient can read it. Right. So that's where cryptography comes in. It uses complex algorithms to encrypt your message, basically scramble it up, make it unreadable. And many of these algorithms, specifically those based on what's called public key cryptography, they rely heavily on the principles of modular arithmetic, which, as we discussed, comes directly from Euclidean division. So Euclidean division is helping to keep my data safe. It is, yeah. That's pretty cool. Yeah, it's amazing. And you also mentioned, like, signal processing. The Euclidean algorithm is used there, too. Can you kind of, like, walk me through that? Sure. So imagine you have an audio signal, and it's contaminated with noise. Okay. You want to clean it up. Right. You might want to analyze the frequencies that are present in both the signal and the noise. Got it. And the Euclidean algorithm can help to identify the greatest common divisor of the frequencies, which can then be used to filter out the unwanted noise. Oh, okay. So it's helping you, like, isolate what you want and get rid of what you don't want. Exactly, yeah. That's pretty cool. It's a clever application. It is, it is. And, you know, you mentioned this before, but the Euclidean algorithm is actually really straightforward to implement in computer programs. Yeah, you said it's one of the earliest known algorithms. It is, yeah, one of the earliest known. And it's a staple in computer science courses. So it really is like a bridge between the theoretical math and the actual, like, concrete, you know, programming. Exactly. That's really neat. It is. So we've talked about cryptography, signal processing. Right. I'm sure there's tons more applications out there. Oh, absolutely. But, you know, one thing that was interesting in the Wikipedia article was that they mentioned that the uniqueness of the quotient and the remainder. Yeah, it's not always guaranteed. What? Yeah, yeah. So when you're dealing with other mathematical structures, like polynomials, it's not always the case. So remind me what a polynomial is. Right, so in simple terms, polynomials are expressions that involve variables raised to powers and combined using addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Okay. So something like x squared plus 2x minus 3, that's a polynomial. Okay, and so how does Euclidean division work with those? It's similar to the division of integers, but instead of focusing on the size of the numbers, we consider the degree of the polynomials. The degree? The degree, yeah, which is essentially the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. Got it. So in that example, x squared plus 2x minus 3 has a degree of 2. Okay. And the remainder, like with integers, has to have a lower degree than the divisor. Okay. But unlike with integers, this condition doesn't always guarantee a unique quotient and remainder. Interesting. Yeah. So the rules change a little bit. They do, a little bit. Okay, that's interesting. So we've got Euclidean division. We kind of get how it works. We're starting to see all these cool connections to all these different areas. Absolutely. This has
