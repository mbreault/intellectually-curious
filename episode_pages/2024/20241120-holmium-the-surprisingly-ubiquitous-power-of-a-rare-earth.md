## Transcript

Welcome to another deep dive. This time, we're taking a closer look at holmium. Holmium. And we've got a whole bunch of sources lined up. Oh, cool. Yeah, we've got some historical excerpts. We've got periodic table data. We even found a scientific podcast episode. Okay. All about holmium. Wow. And it's going to be fascinating because this element is, well, it's anything but rare. In fact, get this, holmium is actually more abundant than silver. Really? Yeah, I was surprised too. I had no idea. So we're going to be exploring that unexpected abundance. We're going to go back to its discovery and we're going to dive into some of its pretty mind-blowing applications. I intrigued already. So if it's not so rare, how was holmium even discovered? Yeah, it's fascinating how perceptions can be misleading. You know, that term rare earth, it kind of throws people off. Yeah, yeah. But when you look at the numbers, holmium is actually more common than we think. So how was it discovered then? Well, like a lot of elements, holmium was discovered through spectroscopy back in 1878. Wow. And there were actually two separate teams working on this. One in Switzerland and the other in Sweden. Okay. And they were analyzing light spectra. Okay. And they stumbled upon some unusual lines that didn't match any known elements. So it's like they were putting together a puzzle, but using light as the clues. Exactly. Wow. These spectral lines, they acted like a fingerprint, revealing the presence of a new element. That's pretty cool. But the two teams at the same time though, it sounds like it could have gotten competitive. It wasn't actually that uncommon back then, especially with these rare earth elements. Okay. You see, they have very similar properties. Right. Which made them tricky to isolate. Okay. Yeah. So often you'd have multiple discoveries happening around the same time. Gotcha. So who actually got the naming rights? Well, the Swedish chemist, Per Teodor Cleve. Okay. He got the honor. Right. He named it holmium after Stockholm. His hometown. The Latin name for Stockholm is holmia. So not the most imaginative name, but it does the job. It stuck. Yeah, it works. So what does this Stockholm-inspired element actually look like? Well, picture a bright silvery metal. Okay. When it's freshly isolated, it's got a nice sheen to it. Shiny. So are we talking like precious metal vibes? Could I fashion a holmium ring? Hold on now, hold on. It's not as resilient as, say, gold or platinum. Okay. Holmium, it tarnishes when it's exposed to air. It forms this yellowish oxide coating. So like iron rusting, but with a yellowish tint. That's a good way to visualize it. Okay. Yeah, it's all about oxidation. Holmium reacting with oxygen in the air. Chemistry in action. Okay, so let's talk about something that's truly mind-blowing about holmium. Okay. And that is its magnetic power. This element boasts the strongest magnetic force of any element. That's right. Did I hear that right? You did. Wow. But there's a little nuance here. Okay, so holmium is a paramagnet. Okay. Meaning that it needs an external magnetic field to actually become magnetic itself. Okay. It's not like those permanent magnets you see on your fridge. Right, right. Those are a little different. So it needs a little push to unlock its magnetic superpowers. Exactly. Okay. But here's where things get really interesting. Right. Below 19 Kelvin, and that's super cold. Yeah. Holmium turns into a ferromagnet. Ferromagnet. So does that mean it becomes like those fridge magnets staying magnetic even without that external field? Precisely. Wow. At those ultra-low temperatures, holmium becomes a ridiculously powerful permanent magnet. Okay. We're talking magnets that are used in research labs, medical imaging. Oh, wow. Even those high-speed trains. Really? Yeah. Wow. Okay. So holmium magnets, they're heavy hitters. But let's dive into a mystery that intertwines holmium with fundamental physics. All right. And that is the quest for the elusive magnetic monopole. Ah, yes. This is where things get really intriguing. You know, this is where things get really intriguing. Okay, so imagine a magnet. Right, right. But it only has one pole, either north or south, but not both. Okay. That's a monopole. Right. And finding one, that would turn our understanding of physics upside down. It would be huge. Hold on. Why is a single-pole magnet such a big deal? Yeah, I mean, it seems like kind of a minor detail. It's far from minor. Okay. Current physics dictates that magnets have to have two poles. Okay. Finding a monopole would rewrite the laws of electromagnetism. Wow. Potentially even lead to breakthroughs in fields like particle physics, cosmology, you name it. So how does holmium fit into this scientific treasure hunt? It challenges everything we know. Yeah, that's a pretty big deal. Well, there have been some tantalizing hints. Okay. But no definitive proof just yet. Right. Back in 1982, there was a physicist who thought he had found a monopole. Oh. But the experiment couldn't be replicated. Okay. And then fast forward to 2023, scientists observed something that resembled monopoles. Oh, wow. In holmium tight-knit crystals. So they saw monopoles. Not exactly. What they detected were formations that acted like monopoles under certain conditions. Think of it as seeing a shadow of the monopoles rather than the real deal. Okay. The mystery continues. So the search for the monopole is still on, and holmium might be the key. It's certainly a contender. Okay. And it's not just the world of magnets where holmium shines. Okay. Let's move on to its surprising role in nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactors. That's a twist. I wouldn't have guessed that. What does holmium do in that environment? Well, holmium has an incredible appetite for neutrons. Okay. It's so good at absorbing them, in fact, that it's used as what we call a burnable poison in nuclear reactors. Burnable poison. Hey. That sounds intense. What does that even mean? It's actually a clever way to control those chain reactions that happen inside a reactor. Oh, okay. Think of it as like a safety mechanism. Holmium soaks up those excess neutrons and prevents the reaction from going out of control. Right. And as it absorbs them, it gradually it burns up. Okay. And that allows for fine-tuning of the reactor's power output. So it's like a neutron sponge keeping things in check. A very specialized sponge. Okay. And what's remarkable is that holmium isn't alone in this. Okay. Other rare earth elements like gadolinium, they also play this role. Okay. But holmium stands out because of its efficiency in capturing those neutrons. Gotcha, gotcha. From powerful magnets to nuclear reactor control. Holmium's versatility is pretty remarkable. But wait, there's more. Oh. It's even used in lasers. That's right. Specifically, holmium-doped lasers in medicine. Yes. Why are holmium lasers so well-suited for these procedures? Well, they emit light at a wavelength that water just loves to absorb. Okay. And since our bodies are mostly water, this allows surgeons to target tissues very precisely while minimizing damage to surrounding areas. It's like a super-precise, water-seeking scalpel. Incredible precision. So holmium is a magnetic powerhouse, a nuclear reactor guardian, and now a high-tech medical tool. What can't this element do? Well, it doesn't stop there. Oh. Holmium also plays a role in those UV spectrophotometers. Okay. You might have used one in a science lab. Vaguely, yeah. Those are the instruments used to analyze how much light passes through a substance, right? Exactly. And here's where holmium's fingerprint comes in handy again. Okay. Remember those unique spectral lines we talked about? Yeah, yeah. Well, they make holmium a perfect reference point for calibrating these spectrophotometers. So it's like a tuning fork for these scientific instruments, ensuring accuracy in measurements. Precisely. Holmium makes sure those scientific readings are consistent and reliable. Right. It's kind of a behind-the-scenes role, but a vital one nonetheless. Okay, so we've covered a lot of ground here. From the surprising abundance of this so-called rare earth element to its incredible applications in magnets, nuclear reactors, even lasers. It's pretty amazing. But I have a feeling there's more to uncover. Stay with us as we delve even deeper into the world of holmium after a short break. Sounds good. Welcome back to our deep dive into holmium. Before the break, we were just about to explore holmium's potential in the, well, the mind-boggling realm of quantum computing. Yeah, quantum computing, it still feels like science fiction to me. How could an element like holmium even help unlock that next level of computational power? One of the biggest hurdles in building quantum computers is finding materials that can hold on to those fragile quantum states for any decent length of time. And holmium, with its unique magnetic properties, might just be the answer. Really? Yeah, researchers are exploring how single holmium atoms could actually act as quantum bits. Wow. Or qubits, the fundamental building blocks of information in a quantum computer. So a single atom of holmium could store information. It's pretty wild, right? That's pretty wild. What makes holmium so special in that quantum world? Well, holmium atoms have what we call a high magnetic moment. Okay. Imagine them as tiny magnets with a really strong magnetic
