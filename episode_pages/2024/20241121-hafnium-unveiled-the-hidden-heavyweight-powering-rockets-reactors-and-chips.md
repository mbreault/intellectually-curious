## Transcript

Welcome back for another deep dive. And this time, we are diving deep into an element that I have to admit, I wasn't super familiar with until you sent this over to me. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's hafnium. Oh, cool. So hafnium, you sent over some Wikipedia excerpts on this. Right. And I'm really excited to learn more about this element because, like I said, I don't really know anything about it. And it's not a household name like oxygen or gold or something like that. Right. It turns out that it has some really, really cool applications. Yeah. So I'm excited to kind of uncover that. Yeah, it's funny how these sort of more obscure elements are often kind of tucked away in our everyday lives. Yeah. You know, but we don't really realize how vital they are. Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, I'm excited to talk about hafnium too. Yeah. So before we get too deep into it, I'm just curious, had you even heard of hafnium before requesting this deep dive? Or is this a totally new element for you two? Well, I had heard of it before, but I couldn't have told you anything about it. You know, it's not something that you really learn about in elementary school or anything like that. Really? But yeah, I knew it existed, and that's about it. Okay. All right, well, I'm glad we're all learning together then. Yeah. So let's just start with some basics then, just to kind of give everyone a foundation for what we're talking about. Sure. So hafnium is a lustrous, silvery-gray, tetravalent transition metal. And chemically, it really closely resembles zirconium. So that's kind of an important thing to keep in mind as we go along here. Right. Almost like siblings on the periodic table. Yeah, exactly. Kind of like siblings with some striking differences that we'll uncover as we go. Oh, interesting. Okay, I like that. Yeah. Okay, so one thing I found really interesting in looking at these Wikipedia excerpts is that hafnium's existence was actually predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev. Oh, wow. Back in 1869. Yeah, the periodic table guy. Periodic table guy, yeah. But it wasn't actually discovered until 1923. Wow. That's a long time. Yeah, so that's like, what, 50-something years? Yeah, that's wild. That it was just kind of out there, like we know it should be there? Right, it's just like a theoretical element. Yeah. Predicted by the patterns, but nobody could actually find it. Yeah, and that, to me, that's kind of mind-blowing. Yeah. You could just know that something should be there, but not be able to actually find it for, you know, over 50 years. Well, it really speaks to the predictive power of the periodic table, though, too, right? Yeah. Like, that Mendeleev was able to arrange it in such a way that he could see there's like a hole here. Yeah. There should be an element that fits these properties. Yeah. That's pretty amazing. Yeah, it is pretty amazing. And it makes you wonder, like, what else is out there? Yeah, are there still elements out there that we just haven't discovered yet? Exactly. Yeah. That's so cool. So cool. So the story behind hafnium's naming is also pretty interesting. Oh, yeah. How so? So it's actually named after Hafnia, which is the Latin name for Copenhagen. Oh, okay. Which is where it was discovered. Interesting. So it's got this, like, kind of cosmopolitan flair to it. Right, yeah. Yeah. Okay, so getting back to those striking differences you mentioned. Okay. Between hafnium and zirconium. Yes. One of the things that really jumped out at me was this concept of relativistic effects. Oh, yeah. I don't really know what that means. Yeah, it sounds very complicated, but it's actually not as daunting as it might seem. Okay. So basically, as you go down the periodic table, atoms generally get larger, right? Okay, yeah. But hafnium kind of breaks the rules a little bit. Okay. Because of something called the lanthanide contraction, it ends up being almost the same size as zirconium, even though it's located a row below it. Oh, interesting. On the periodic table. So it's unexpectedly small for its position. And that has some interesting consequences. Okay, I see where this is going. So it's smaller. Right. But obviously, it has to be heavier. Yeah, it's further down, so it has more protons and neutrons. Right. More mass packed into a smaller space. So it's super dense. Yeah, exactly. Hafnium is about twice as dense as zirconium. Wow, okay. And this density is really one of the key reasons why it finds itself used in all sorts of different applications, especially where you need something that's really strong and durable, like, for example, rocket nozzles. Wait, hafnium is used in rockets? Yeah, we'll get into that a little bit later. Okay. But first, there's another really fascinating aspect of hafnium that I want to talk about. Okay. And that's its ability to essentially stop neutrons in their tracks. Neutrons like the ones in nuclear reactors. Exactly. Oh, okay. This is starting to sound pretty important. Yeah, it's super important. So hafnium has what's called a high thermal neutron capture cross-section, which is basically a fancy way of saying it's really, really good at absorbing neutrons, which are the subatomic particles that are essential for nuclear reactions. And so this ability to just gobble up neutrons makes hafnium extremely valuable in the world of nuclear power. So it's almost like it's like a shield, like it's protecting us from those neutrons? Yeah, in a way you can think of it like that. Okay. So think about it like this. In a nuclear reactor, you need a way to control the chain reaction, right? You don't want it to spiral out of control. Right, of course. And that's where hafnium comes in. Okay. Control rods made of hafnium can be inserted into the reactor core to absorb those neutrons and regulate the speed of the reaction. Okay. So they're kind of like the brakes on a really, really powerful engine. Wow. So we're talking like safe operation of nuclear power plants here. Absolutely. Yeah, it's crucial. Okay. And it gets even more interesting when you consider that some isotopes of hafnium can actually absorb multiple neutrons each. What? Yeah. So they're like little neutron-stopping superheroes. Wow, that's crazy. I know, it's pretty cool. But here's where things get a little bit tricky. Okay. Remember how we talked about hafnium being like zirconium's twin? Well, it turns out that separating those two is incredibly difficult. Oh, really? Yeah, because they have almost identical chemical properties. So it's not like you can just easily pull them apart. So how do they even get the hafnium out if they need pure zirconium for the reactor? Yeah, that's a great question. And it's actually a challenge, especially because when it comes to nuclear reactors, you actually don't want hafnium hanging around in your zirconium. Why not? I thought it was the good guy absorbing all the neutrons. It is, but in the wrong place, it can actually be a hindrance. Okay. So for the structural components of a nuclear reactor, you need a material that's essentially as transparent to neutrons as possible. Okay. You want those neutrons to be able to flow freely and do their job in the chain reaction. Okay. And any hafnium that's mixed in with that zirconium is kind of like putting speed bumps in their path. Oh, I see. So it slows them down and makes the reactor less efficient. So they have to purify the zirconium, and then they have all this hafnium leftover that they can use for the control rods. Exactly. Yeah, it's like a two-for-one deal. Wow, that's really cool. It took a lot of scientific ingenuity to develop these separation methods needed to produce that hafnium-free zirconium. But in doing so, they also unlock this really valuable source of this neutron-absorbing material. Huh, interesting. Yeah, it's a pretty cool story. Yeah, it is a cool story. Yeah. So we've got this element that's incredibly dense. Right. Can stop neutrons cold. Yeah. Where else does hafnium pop up? You mentioned rockets earlier, I think. Yeah. Before we start talking about neutrons. Right, so yeah, hafnium's density makes it incredibly strong and able to withstand, like, really extreme temperatures. Okay. So you find it in alloys used in some pretty demanding applications. Like what? Well, one example that might surprise you is in the Apollo lunar modules. Hold on, are you telling me that there was hafnium on the missions to the moon? Yeah, those iconic spacecraft, they actually used a hafnium alloy in their rocket nozzles. Wow. Which is the part that channels the superhot exhaust gases as they're blasting off. So yeah, it's a testament to just how tough this metal is. That's amazing. So from controlling nuclear reactions to helping us reach the moon. Hafnium has been on quite a journey. It really has. And I understand it's also playing a crucial role in modern electronics as well. It is, yeah. So as technology advances and our devices get smaller and more powerful, the materials we use have to keep up. Yeah. And it turns out that hafnium oxide is a fantastic insulator. Okay. And it's become a key component in the transistors of advanced microprocessors. So hafnium is literally inside the computers and smartphones we use every day. It's quite possible, yeah.
