In this episode, we explore the infamous exodus from Shockley Semiconductor and the birth of Fairchild, tracing how Moore, Noyce, and their colleagues reshaped tech, developed planar technology, and spawned a generation of 'Fairchildren' who launched a valley-wide wave of innovation.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. Today, we're going deep into a story that I think you'll find really fascinating. It's about the traitorous eight. Ah, yes. Quite a pivotal moment in the history of, well, Silicon Valley as we know it, really. Right. I mean, this group of engineers, they basically walked out of Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, and, well, they ended up forming Fairchild Semiconductor. Which, you know, had huge ripple effects for the whole industry, really. Exactly. And we actually have a great source for this deep dive. We're going to be looking closely at the Wikipedia excerpt on the traitorous eight. Should be a fun ride. Definitely. Lots to unpack there. The personalities, the technology, the whole, I guess you could say the birth of Silicon Valley in a way? It all starts with William Shockley, right? Nobel Prize winner, co-invents the transistor, super brilliant guy. Oh, absolutely. A visionary. But also a bit of a, well, shall we say, a challenging personality to work with. Yeah, that seemed to be a recurring theme. So, Shockley, he wants to mass-produce transistors, advanced ones, and diodes, too. And he starts Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in 1955. Gets funding from Arnold Beckman. Ambitious stuff. Very much so. And to achieve this, he recruits this team of, like, incredibly talented young PhD grads. Some serious brain power there. Names you might recognize, actually. Oh, for sure. Gordon Moore, who co-founded Intel later on. Robert Noyce, another giant in the field. These guys were just starting out, but already, you know, stars in the making. Yeah, the talent pool was just remarkable. And get this, Shockley, he has each of them negotiate their salary individually. And then he makes all the salaries public knowledge within the company. Whoa, really? That's kind of a power move, isn't it? Oh, for sure. Speaks volumes about his management style, which, well, the Wikipedia article hints at it. It wasn't exactly the most collaborative, shall we say. Right, because you'd think with all these brilliant minds in one place, you'd want to encourage, you know, sharing ideas, working together. You would think so, wouldn't you? But Shockley, he was, well, he had his own methods, like recording employee phone calls. Whoa, seriously? Yep. And he even prohibited them from talking about their research with each other. Like, imagine that in a research lab. Must have created a pretty tense atmosphere. Oh, it did. And it ultimately backfired, because you're right, in that kind of cutting-edge environment, you need that free flow of ideas. It's fuel for innovation. So this lack of collaboration, it really hurt them in the long run. Oh, absolutely. And then there's the whole Shockley diode situation. Ah, yes. His own invention. From what I understand, scientifically interesting, but not exactly a commercial hit, right? You got it. Big strategic misstep, that was. The lab should have been focused on bipolar transistors, but Shockley, he insisted on prioritizing his diode. And this, on top of the spying and the secrecy and everything, it created quite a bit of friction, I imagine. Oh, definitely. Things were coming to a head, and on top of all that, Shockley was getting more and more, well, let's just say paranoid, really started impacting the lab dynamics. So this is where our traitorous eight come into the picture, right? They're seeing all this happening, and they're not happy about it. They were getting increasingly disillusioned, that's for sure. I mean, imagine working in that environment, with all that talent and potential being stifled. So they decide to take matters into their own hands. They did. They presented an ultimatum to Arnold Beckman, the guy who was financing the lab. Replace Shockley, or we walk. Bold move. Huge gamble, too. I mean, they were risking their careers. It was a pivotal moment, that's for sure. But it really shows how deeply unhappy they were with the situation. They were willing to risk everything for a chance to do things differently. And Beckman, what did he do, faced with losing this incredible team? Well, he made a decision he would later regret. He chose to side with Shockley. Wow. So that's it, then. The traitorous eight, their ultimatum fails, and they decide to leave. Exactly. In 1957, they resigned from Shockley Semiconductor, and that's where things get really interesting. I mean, walking away from Shockley Labs, that was a huge risk, right? I mean, they were leaving a pretty well-established lab, lots of security, I'd imagine. Oh, yeah. Big time gamble. But you've got to admire their entrepreneurial spirit, right? I mean, they had this belief in themselves, in their vision, and that's what drove them. And they managed to get funding. They did. Found a backer in Sherman Fairchild. He had a reputation for supporting cutting-edge technology, new ideas. Smart move on their part. Yeah. But wait, wasn't most of the electronics industry concentrated on the East Coast back then? It was, yeah. That was the hub. But these guys, they decided to stay put in California, didn't want to relocate. Interesting. And that decision, I mean, looking back now, it's pretty significant, right? Huge. I mean, that's essentially the starting point of what we know as Silicon Valley today. It's like their decision to stay put, it kind of like planted the seed. Wow. So, Fairchild Semiconductor is born. What were some of their early wins? What made them stand out? Well, they really focused on silicon diffusion mesa transistors. This was a technology that offered some big improvements over the older transistor designs. Okay, I got to ask, what exactly are silicon diffusion mesa transistors? I'm sure our listeners would want to know, too. Sure, sure. So, think of a mesa transistor as, well, it's got this active region that's raised above the surrounding substrate, kind of like a plateau, hence the name mesa. I see, like a little plateau of silicon. Right. And the silicon diffusion part, that's the process of, well, they introduce impurities into the silicon and that creates the different regions of the transistor. It's pretty complex, but the end result is you get these transistors that are smaller, more efficient, and way more reliable. So this was like their secret weapon, what gave them an edge. Yeah, you could say that. It really put them on the map. And, you know, within the team, you had these individual members who were still pushing the boundaries even further. Like Gordon Moore, he made some major contributions to improving the performance and the reliability of these transistors. And then you've got Jean Horaney. He comes up with this idea for planar technology. It was a totally new way of manufacturing transistors. Planar technology. Okay, that sounds like a big deal. Break that down for us a bit. So basically, planar technology, it's all about making transistors on a flat surface of silicon. And this, it had all these advantages, like better reliability. You could fit more transistors onto a chip, and it was way easier to mass produce. So this is a step towards the integrated circuits and microchips that we rely on today. Exactly. It's a foundational technology, really. But even with all this success, there were still some tensions within the group. Really? I mean, you'd think they'd be, like, riding high, celebrating their wins. What was the issue? Well, even on a winning team, you're going to have, you know, strong personalities, different opinions. Like, there was this friction between Moore and Horaney over who really deserved the credit for developing planar technology. Makes sense. Everyone wants their due credit, especially when the stakes are so high. Right. And then things get even more complicated when Sherman Fairchild, he decides to exercise his right to buy back the shares that the traitorous eight owned. Oh, wow. So the ownership structure of the company changes. Yeah, it does. And this, well, it leads to Jay Last and Jean Horaney leaving Fairchild in 1961. They go on to found a new company, Amelco. So it's not just a single company story anymore. It's branching out, creating this whole web of new ventures. Exactly. This was just the first split, really. The beginning of a chain reaction that would see the traitorous eight and a lot of their colleagues go on to start a whole bunch of other companies. It's mind-blowing when you think about the impact they had. It's like Fairchild was this incubator for future tech giants. Yeah, I like that, incubator. It really captures the essence of what was happening. It was a place that attracted brilliant minds, and then it kind of, like, nurtured their entrepreneurial spirit, their drive to push boundaries. And this brings us to a term I've heard associated with Fairchild, the Fairchildren. What exactly does that refer to? Ah, yes, the Fairchildren. It's basically a term used to describe all the people who worked at Fairchild and then went on to start their own WN companies. Okay, so it's like a whole generation of entrepreneurs spawned from this one company. Exactly. And these spinoffs, they were driven by this culture of innovation that was, like, baked into Fairchild's DNA. It's a huge part of why Silicon Valley became, you know, the global center for tech innovation that it is today. So the traitorous eight, their legacy, it goes way beyond just Fairchild. Oh, absolutely. It's way bigger than just one company. Their decision
