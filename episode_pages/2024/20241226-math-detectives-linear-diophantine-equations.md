## Description

A concise tour of linear Diophantine equations: how to tell when a solution exists using gcd, how to actually find solutions with the extended Euclidean algorithm and Bezoutâ€™s identity, and how infinite solution families arise. Weâ€™ll connect the theory to real-world puzzles like the Absentâ€‘Minded Teller, plus applications in programming contests and cryptography.

## Transcript

All right, let's get into it. This deep dive, we're tackling some pretty cool math. Linear Diophantine equations. You know, and you sent over a bunch of stuff, academic papers, that Wikipedia page, even a site for competitive programmers. It's like, you want me to solve some serious math problems. Yeah, I mean, it's pretty exciting to see all that, right? It shows you want to really understand LDEs, like what they actually are, you know, the history and how we use them. Exactly, and I have a feeling there's a lot more to these equations than meets the eye. It can't just be some abstract math concept, can it? You're right on the money. Actually, to start things off, I found this really cool problem. It's called the absent-minded teller problem. So imagine, right, a woman is cashing a check, but the teller, he mixes up the dollars and cents. Okay. And so she doesn't realize it at first, but then after she spends five cents, she's like, wait a minute, I have like twice the amount of money I should have. Wow, that sounds like a recipe for disaster. How do you even, like, how would you even figure that out? Well, you know, that's exactly where these linear Diophantine equations come in. They're like, they're almost like math detectives, right? They help us solve these puzzles that have to do with whole numbers. Interesting. So, okay, how do these math detectives work then? What's so special about a Diophantine equation? Well, at their core, right, at their core, Diophantine equations, they're these polynomial equations. But the thing is, we only want solutions that are whole numbers, no decimals. Okay. No decimals allowed. And so the simplest kind, right, those are called linear Diophantine equations. Basically the unknowns, so usually we use X and Y. They're not raised to any powers and they kind of look like this. AX plus BY, where A, B, and C are all integers, whole numbers. So like 2X plus 3Y equals 5. Would that be an example? Yes. And how would you use these in the real world? Where do they pop up? You got it, yeah. That's a perfect example. As for the real world, think about it like this. Anytime you've got to combine like whole units of things and you have a target, right, you have a specific target. Could be, I don't know, figuring out like combinations of ingredients or allocating resources for a project or even as we saw with the absent-minded teller, you know, solving these weird money mix-ups. Yeah, that's starting to make sense to me. So with that teller problem, we could like use an equation like that to represent the dollars and cents, I guess. Exactly, exactly. And you know, the fun part is it's figuring out if there even is a solution before you do all these like crazy calculations. Okay. And that's where the greatest common divisor comes in, you know, the GCD. Ah, GCD, yeah. I remember that. The biggest number that divides into two others, right? Yeah. Without a remainder. You got it. So how does that help us with these equations? So a solution only exists if the GCD of A and B, so in our equation, right, divides evenly into C, all right? It's like a quick check, a quick check to see if we're even on the right track. If it doesn't divide C, then we know there's no solution, you know? Wow, that's a really handy shortcut. So what if it does? What if the GCD does divide C? How do we find the actual solution, like the actual X and Y that work? That's where we need like the star player, right? And that's the extended Euclidean algorithm. And it's not just, you know, any algorithm. This is like the H-E key. It's a two-for-one deal. Okay. It finds the GCD and gives us the coefficients, the X and Y values to satisfy what we call Bezout's identity. Hold on, hold on. Bezout's identity, what is that? And how does that fit into all of this? All right, you got me curious. Break this Bezout thing down for me. What's so special about it? Well, think of it like our math insurance policy, right? It basically guarantees we can always find some integers X and Y to make this expression AX plus BY equal to the GCD of A and B. So it's kind of like saying, hey, a solution exists, and here's the blueprint to find it. So it's not just telling us there is one. It's giving us like a place to start looking. Yeah. And is that where that extended Euclidean algorithm comes in? It uses that blueprint to like pinpoint the X and Y? Exactly, yeah, like a master key. And let's go back to that teller problem for a sec. Remember, she got those dollars and cents flipped. We can make our equation 100 plus X, so that's what she has, minus 5 because she spent a nickel, has to equal twice the amount she should have gotten. So 2 times 100X plus Y. Okay, so if we simplify that, it's 199 by 98Y equals 5 and 5. Now it looks like the equations we were talking about. See, math detective's on the case. Now the GCD of 199 and 98, well, that's 1. And 1 divides 9 into 5 evenly, so bam, a solution exists. Okay. And then the extended Euclidean algorithm would give us, you know, a particular solution for X and Y. But what if those numbers are like negative? You can't have negative dollars or cents, right? At least not in this problem, I guess. That's a great point. A particular solution might not always be the most realistic. But the cool thing is, linear Diophantine equations, they can have infinitely many solutions. Whoa, really? Yeah. And they all lie on a line, like if you were to graph them. Infinite solutions, huh? Yeah. So how do we find the right one for our teller? You know, out of all the infinite ones. Well, we use that particular solution as like a stepping stone, you know? We kind of hop along that line. By adding multiples of BG to X, and then subtracting multiples of AG from Y, where G is our good old GCD. And that gives a whole bunch of solutions. So we're like moving along a number line, jumping between solutions until we find one that works. In the teller problem, we just keep going until both the dollars and the cents are positive. That's actually pretty neat. It is. But let's not get too lost in the infinite. Sometimes we only care about solutions within certain limits, right? Like if we have limited resources or physical constraints or something like that, we've got to find solutions that fit. So we can't just hop along the whole number line willy-nilly. We've got to like set boundaries and stick to those. Exactly, exactly. It's like adding a filter to our solution process, you know? We start with that particular solution and then check which hops actually land us in the right zone. This is making these theoretical equations feel so much more real. It's not just solving for X and I anymore. We're like using them to solve actual problems. And remember those competitive programming sources you sent? Yeah. This is where LDEs can really, really shine. Like imagine a programmer has to find integer solutions within specific constraints, right? Knowing about LDEs would be a huge advantage for them, I bet. Absolutely. They'd have the tools to solve it fast, which in a competition, that's everything. It all comes down to recognizing when you can use an LDE as a tool and having the right algorithm to solve it quickly. But hey, you mentioned cryptography before, right? Yeah. How do these equations help us keep our information safe online? So, okay, my brain is like overloaded with LDE applications now. Tell me, how do they fit into the world of cryptography? You know, keeping our data safe. Well, in cryptography, you know, the whole point is to scramble information, right? So that only the right person can unscramble it. Right. And one of the key tools we use for that are these things called modular inverses. Modular inverses. Okay, I'm intrigued. What are those and how do they connect to LDEs? Okay, imagine a clock face, right? The numbers don't go up forever. They wrap around. So that's modular arithmetic. We only care about the remainders after we divide. Okay. A modular inverse, it's like finding a number's opposite on that clock. Like when you multiply a number by its modular inverse and then you divide by the clock size, you get a remainder of one. So it's like a number that undoes the original number, but on this like circular clock face. But how do LDEs fit in? Okay, so here's the cool part. Finding a modular inverse is basically the same as solving a specific LDE. So let's say we want the inverse of A modulo B. Okay. That means we got to find an X so that A times X leaves a remainder of one when we divide by B. We write it like AX O1 mod B. All right, so we're trying to find the undo number, the X that makes that congruence, I think you called it, work. But I'm still not seeing the LDE. Watch this. We can turn that congruence into an LDE like this. AX plus by which one? C. Our C is just one now. And if we can solve this equation for X
