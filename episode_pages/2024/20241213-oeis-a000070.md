## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into the fascinating world of the OEIS. You know, we're exploring this vast collection of integer sequences. One intriguing number pattern at a time. Exactly. And today, we're going to tackle A000070. Yeah, A000070. A sequence that might seem unassuming at first glance, yeah. But trust me, it's deeply connected to some pretty fundamental concepts in number theory. Oh, absolutely. Combinatorics. So for our listeners who might need a quick refresher, what exactly is a partition? I'm sure a lot of people listening are familiar, but it's always good to lay that foundation. Absolutely. A partition of a number is basically just a way to represent it as a sum of positive integers. Okay. For example, let's just take the number 4. Okay. We could express it as, well, 4 is 3 plus 1, 2 plus 2, 2 plus 1 plus 1, or even 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1. Right. Each of those combinations is a distinct partition of 4. Okay, so how does this tie into A000070 specifically? I'm looking at the sequence now, 1, 2, 4, 7, 12. Right. What's the pattern connecting these numbers back to those partitions? So the pattern lies in the number of partitions. Okay. The nth term in A000070, which we denote as A of n, represents the total number of partitions for all the integers from 0 up to n. So for instance, the A of 4 would be the count of all partitions of 0. Okay. 1, 2, 3, and 4 combined. Okay, I see. So as we move further down the sequence, it's not just about the individual partitions, but rather the cumulative count of all the ways we can break down increasing numbers. That's pretty neat. It is. But I have a feeling this is just the beginning. Oh, this is definitely just the tip of the iceberg. Yeah. The OEIS entry hints at some surprising connections that go beyond simply counting partitions. Absolutely. So A000070 isn't just about the total number of partitions. It also kind of encodes information about the specific integers used within those partitions. For example, it also counts the total number of different integers used across all the partitions of n plus 1. Okay, that sounds intriguing. Yeah. Can you illustrate that with an example, though? Sure. Just to make sure I'm grasping the concept. Of course. Let's stick with n equals 3. Okay. Which means we're examining the partitions of 4. We have 4, 3 plus 1, 2 plus 2, 2 plus 1 plus 1, and 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1. Yes. If we list out all the integers present across these partitions, we get 1, 2, 3, and 4. Okay. A total of four distinct integers. Right. Now here's the key. Even if a number appears multiple times within a single partition, we only count it once. Okay. So despite 1 appearing four times in the partition 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1, it only contributes once to our final count. Gotcha. And if you check the sequence, A of 3, which is the fourth term, is indeed 7. That's fascinating. It's like this sequence is revealing a hidden structure. Yeah. Within the seemingly simple act of partitioning numbers. It is. It's really interesting. And there's even more to uncover. Oh, yeah. I noticed a comment in the OEIS entry. Yeah. That mentions a connection to something called Ferrer's diagrams. Right. Which sounds very visually compelling. They are. Ferrer's diagrams offer a really elegant way to actually visualize partitions. Oh. Imagine representing each number in a partition as a row of dots. Uh-huh. With the rows arranged in descending order of length. So for the partition 4, you'd have a single row of four dots. Right. For 3 plus 1, you'd have a row of three dots above a row of one dot. Gotcha. And so on. Now what's fascinating is that if you take the Ferrer's diagram for each partition of n and add a new dot represented by an asterisk to the end of each row, you essentially generate all the partitions of n plus 1. Okay. Though with some repetitions. So we're essentially constructing the partitions for the next number. Yes. By systematically building upon the existing ones. Exactly. And the number of ways we can do this is precisely what A000070 is tracking. Precisely. Wow. And this observation about Ferrer's diagrams comes from a comment by mathematician John Perry. Oh, wow. It's a testament to the collaborative nature of the OEIS. Yeah. It's a platform where mathematicians contribute their insights and observations. Right. Enriching our understanding of these sequences in some really unexpected ways. That's a fantastic point. The OEIS is clearly more than just a catalog of numbers. Oh, for sure. It's a vibrant community. Yeah, definitely. Where mathematical exploration unfolds. Absolutely. And speaking of further exploration, we've only just scratched the surface of A000070. We have. There's so much more to delve into. Yeah, there's much more to delve into, including connections to one transitions and even the world of graph theory. Oh, yeah. But for now, we'll take a pause and return in our next segment to uncover these intriguing connections. Stay tuned. All right. Welcome back. We've been exploring A000070 and its connections to partitions and Ferrer's diagrams. Right. The OEIS entry mentions something called one transitions. Yes. What are those? So one transitions. And how do they relate to this sequence? Offer another way to visualize and manipulate partitions. OK. Imagine you have a partition that includes at least one one. A one transition involves removing one of those ones and adding it to another number within that same partition. So if we had the partition two plus one plus one, a one transition could involve removing a one and adding it to the two, resulting in three plus one. Precisely. OK. And here's an important detail. OK. If you have multiple instances of the same number, they're considered interchangeable. So in our example, three plus one is equivalent to one plus three. Right. The order of the numbers within the partition doesn't affect the outcome of the one transition. I see. So it's about the overall structure of the partition. Yeah. Not the specific positions of the individual numbers. Exactly. OK. But how does A000070 quantify these one transitions? So A000070 of n gives us the total number of possible one transitions across all the partitions of n. OK. What's particularly interesting is that these one transitions can be organized into a structure called a poset. Short for partially ordered set. A poset. That sounds intriguing, but I must admit I'm not familiar with that term. Sure. Could you elaborate on what a poset is and how it applies here? Of course. A poset is a way to represent relationships between elements in a set where not all elements are necessarily comparable. In the case of partitions and one transitions, we can say one partition is less than another if we can reach the second partition by applying a series of one transitions to the first. OK. For instance, the partition one plus one plus one plus one is less than the partition four because we can perform three consecutive one transitions to transform the former into the latter. So it's like creating a hierarchy. Yeah. Or a family tree of partitions. Where some are ancestors of others. Yeah. Based on these one transitions. That's a great analogy. OK. It highlights how A000070 reveals not just the number of partitions and one transitions, but also the intricate relationships between them. Fascinating. And there's yet another fascinating connection to explore. Yes, there is. Right. The realm of graph theory. Exactly. A000070 also counts the number of unlabeled subgraphs of a specific type of graph called an n-cycle. Now, graph theory might be a bit outside the comfort zone for some of our listeners. Sure. Perhaps you could provide a brief introduction to graphs and n-cycles before we delve into this connection. Of course. In graph theory, a graph is a visual representation of relationships between objects. It consists of vertices, which are points, connected by edges, which are lines. Okay. An n-cycle, denoted as c sub n, is a specific type of graph where n vertices are connected in a closed loop. Okay. So a three-cycle, or c sub 3, is simply a triangle. Right. A four-cycle, or c sub 4, is a square, and so on. So these n-cycles are essentially polygons with n sides. Precisely. Okay. And how does A000070 relate to these graphical structures? So A000070 also counts the number of unlabeled subgraphs of the n-cycle c sub n. Okay. A subgraph is essentially a smaller graph contained within a larger one. Okay. For instance, if you remove one of the edges from a triangle, c3, you get a subgraph that's just a line with two vertices. Okay. Unlabeled means we're only concerned with the overall structure of the subgraph, not the specific arrangement or labeling of the vertices. So for each n-cycle, there's a certain number of ways to create these smaller unlabeled subgraphs within it. Yes. And that number is given by A000070. Exactly. It's a remarkable link between the world of partitions and the visual realm of graphs. Wow. Further demonstrating the interconnectedness of these mathematical concepts. That's incredible. For example, let's take c3, our triangle. There are several possible subgraphs we can create. The triangle itself, subgraphs with two connected vertices, subgraphs
