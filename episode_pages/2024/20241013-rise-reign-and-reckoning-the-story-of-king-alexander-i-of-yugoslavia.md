## Transcript

Have you ever thought about how history seems to repeat itself? It's kind of eerie, right? Well, that's what we're diving into today, the story of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. We're using excerpts from his Wikipedia entry to, well, to explore how this king, born in exile, managed to rise to power and how he dealt with the very forces that ultimately brought him down. It's actually fascinating how much his early life really shaped how he saw the world. Imagine, just imagine being born in 1888, but not in, you know, some grand palace. Instead, you're in exile in Montenegro and your family, the Piri Jurjevich dynasty, they've been kicked out of Serbia. The rivals, the ObrenoviÄ‡, were ruling with Austro-Hungarian backing, no less. Talk about some intense family history, right? It's like a real-life Game of Thrones. And to add even more drama, the young Alexander, his education takes him from Montenegro to Switzerland and then, get this, to Russia. He trains in the elite page corps. And that's a pivotal moment for him. It's where he develops this deep admiration for Russia, especially for Tsar Nicholas II. Remember that, okay? Because it's super important later on. It speaks volumes about how Alexander viewed leadership, how he understood power. It's like the seeds of his later belief in a strong, centralized government, one he thought was absolutely essential for holding together a nation that's already fractured, are sown right there. So while he's like soaking up this autocratic model in Russia, back in Serbia, boom, it's 1903 and the May overthrow happens. King Alexander ObrenoviÄ‡ and Queen Draga, they're assassinated in this bloody coup. It totally changes the game, right? It paves the way for the KaradjordjeviÄ‡ dynasty to make their comeback. And that's where Alexander's path takes this really interesting turn. He goes back to Serbia, joins the army, but, and this is key, it's actually his older brother George, who's first in line to the throne. He's the heir apparent until scandal rocks the royal family. George, well, let's just say he had a bit of temper. Things get out of hand with a servant, turns violent, and suddenly he's deemed unfit to rule. Talk about a twist of fate. And just like that, Alexander, the younger brother, is thrust into the spotlight. He's the new crown prince of Serbia. It's not a position he was expecting, not at all, but it's one that will have a huge impact on his life. A huge impact. It's like someone just hit the fast forward button on his life, huh? Exactly. He's barely had time to warm the seat as crown prince when, bam, the Balkan Wars erupt. And just like that, he's leading Serbian forces against the Ottomans, against the Bulgarians. And, you know, this is where we really see that admiration for strong leadership he developed in Russia. It kind of translates into action. He earns recognition for his military skills, you know, for his strategic thinking, leads the Serbian army to some key victories in both Balkan Wars. So he's got that whole war hero image going for him. Right. But I'm sensing a but here. Well, yeah. There's always a but when it comes to history, isn't there? He's getting praised for his leadership, sure, but troubling signs start popping up, too. Like, there's this story about Alexander. Apparently, he slapped a young girl just because she said she was Bulgarian. It might seem like a small thing, but it speaks volumes about the deep ethnic tensions simmering beneath the surface. Tensions that would unfortunately continue to cast a shadow over his reign. Oh, wow. And then, as if things weren't already complicated enough, 1914 rolls around. World War I. The whole world explodes. And Alexander, who's now Prince Regent, he leads Serbia straight into the firestorm against Austria-Hungary, no less. Talk about a trial by fire, right? And this war, man, it really put Alexander and the Serbian people through the wringer. I mean, their army, they were definitely outmatched, not enough resources, you know. But they fought like demons. They actually managed to push back that initial Austrian invasion. But in the end, they were up against a wall. They had no choice but to retreat. And it was a brutal retreat through the Albanian mountains in the dead of winter. Just trying to imagine that journey, the terrain, the freezing cold, soldiers, civilians, everyone just desperate to survive. It's hard to fathom. It's a testament to their spirit, that's for sure. And this shared hardship, it created a powerful bond between Alexander and his people. It cemented his image as, you know, as a leader who wouldn't hesitate to share in their suffering. But here's the thing. It also solidified his belief that, like, only a strong, unified Yugoslavia could ever hope to stand up to their neighbors, the ones with, you know, less than friendly intentions. You could say that his vision for Yugoslavia, it was forged in the fires of war. So then World War I ends in 1918. Austria-Hungary collapses and Alexander, well, he sees his opportunity. He oversees the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Later, of course, it's known as Yugoslavia. And he's hailed as this great unifier, bringing everyone together. But is it really that straightforward? Ah, now that's the million dollar question, isn't it? Because in 1921, when Alexander officially becomes king of this brand new nation, what does he inherit? A kingdom? Sure. But one that's already deeply, deeply divided along ethnic lines, religious lines. It was like a patchwork quilt of competing identities, hopes, dreams. And let's not forget the trauma of that war. It's still fresh. The scars are everywhere. It's a recipe for disaster. And Alexander, well, he's shaped by his experiences, right? He's determined to hold it all together, whatever it takes. And it sounds like he was facing threats from all sides. Assassination attempts, political maneuvering, this constant feeling that things could fall apart at any second. Oh, absolutely. And all that pressure, that feeling of being surrounded by enemies, both inside Yugoslavia and outside its borders. It takes a toll. Remember his admiration for the Tsar, that model of, shall we say, firm leadership he encountered back in Russia? Well, it starts to resurface. He becomes convinced that if he loosens his grip, even a little, if he lets go of any power, if he gives in to any of those regional interests, it'll be the end of Yugoslavia. So he feels like, what, his back's against the wall and his solution is to double down on control? Pretty much. In 1929, after a Croatian politician, Japan Radich, is assassinated, Alexander makes a, well, a really drastic move. He gets rid of the constitution, just poof, gone. Parliament, too. And he declares himself dictator, a royal dictator, of course. Wow. Talk about a power move. But it makes you wonder, was it like a calculated decision or was it more out of desperation, fear? Probably a bit of both, if we're being honest. I mean, you got to remember his background, that whole fascination with strong rulers, right? But yeah, it was a huge gamble, that's for sure. He renames the country Yugoslavia, redraws the internal borders, even tries to create a whole new national identity, like overnight, trying to erase centuries of cultural and religious differences. It's a tall order, to say the least. It's like he thought he could just, I don't know, order everyone to get along. Right. And unsurprisingly, it doesn't exactly work out the way he planned, especially the Croatians and the Bosnian Muslims. They feel like they're being ignored, pushed aside in this quest for a unified Yugoslavia. And that resentment, it creates a breeding ground for extremist groups like the Ustahi, a Croatian fascist movement. So now he's dealing with all this internal turmoil, plus you've got the rise of fascism in Italy, a newly powerful Germany under Hitler. The world's a powder keg, ready to blow. No doubt about it. And Alexander, stuck in the middle of it all, he's scrambling, trying to find a way to make sure Yugoslavia survives. So he starts looking for allies, particularly France. They were a major player in the Little Entente, you know, that pact with Czechoslovakia and Romania meant to keep Hungary's ambitions in check. Right, right. It was a constant balancing act for Alexander, trying to play all sides, keep everyone happy, or at least at bay. And that search for allies leads him to France in 1934. But instead of finding stability, he finds, well, tragedy. Yeah. It's one of those moments that's forever frozen in time, you know, one of the first assassinations ever caught on film. Picture this. Alexander's motorcade, it's winding its way through the streets of Marseille. Crowds are lining the streets and then chaos. A gunman, Velado Ternazemski, just appears out of nowhere and starts shooting right into the car. It's hard to even imagine. Such a stark reminder that no matter how powerful you are, things can change in an instant. Absolutely. And what makes it even more tragic is the irony of it all. Here's Alexander, this king who spent his entire reign trying to force his vision of a unified Yugoslavia on a country that's already deeply divided. And how does it end? He's assassinated by the very forces he was trying to control. Ternazemski, the gunman, he was a Bulgarian nationalist with ties to the U
