## Transcript

All right, so get this, we're going on a deep dive today about a creature that basically pulls off a trick straight out of a sci-fi movie. Really? Yeah, we're talking the wood frog. Okay. Tiny amphibian with this, like, unbelievable survival strategy. Okay, I'm intrigued. Lay it on me. They spend their winters frozen solid. Frozen? Like completely frozen? Completely. We're talking, like, popsicle, and then they thaw out in the spring, good as new. It's crazy. That's wild. I mean, how is that even possible? Right, that's what we're going to find out. I've been digging into some info from the National Park Service. Good source. And there's this super detailed Wikipedia entry on wood frogs. Nice, yeah, Wikipedia, the rabbit hole of information. Seriously. We're going to use all that to try and understand how this amazing adaptation works. All right, I'm ready. Let's crack this case. Okay, so first things first. Gotta set the scene. Imagine you're in the boreal forests of Alaska or Canada. Beautiful. Summers can be pretty nice there, actually. Sometimes hit 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Not bad, not bad. But the winters. Oh, yeah, that's a different story. Totally different story. Brutal, right. We're talking, like, bone chilling. Minus 50, even minus 80 Fahrenheit sometimes. Oof. Remember that record-breaking minus 80 they recorded in Prospect Creek, Alaska? Yikes. I bet there were some very frozen wood frogs under the snow there. For sure. Okay, so most frogs faced with that kind of cold, they'd head for deep water. Makes sense. A little insulation, right? Exactly. Hibernate, where it's at least a little bit warmer. Right. Not our friend the wood frog, though. Oh, no. Nope. They go for the leaf litter on the forest floor. Hmm. Seems like they're choosing the less cozy option. You'd think, but this is where it gets really interesting. They don't just hibernate. They actually freeze solid. Hold on. You're saying their heart stops? Everything stops. Everything. Breathing, heartbeat, everything just stops. It's like they hit the pause button on their bodies for, like, eight months. Whoa, okay, but hold on. Isn't freezing, you know, usually a death sentence for living things? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, think about it. When things freeze, ice crystals form, right? Right. And those crystals inside a body, they can do some serious damage. Yeah. Shredding blood vessels, cutting off oxygen, dehydrating cells. Yeah. Leading to... You get the picture. Not pretty. So how on earth does the wood frog avoid this icy doom? What's their secret weapon? Okay, so are you ready for this? It's glucose. Glucose, like sugar. Sugar. Basically, as the wood frog starts to freeze, their liver goes into overdrive. Okay. Starts pumping massive amounts of glucose sugar into their bloodstream. We're talking levels that would be deadly for us. Really? So their blood basically turns into sugar syrup. Not exactly syrup, but you're getting the idea. Think of it like nature's antifreeze. Hmm, interesting. Inside the cells, it prevents water from turning into those sharp, damaging ice crystals. It's like protecting the delicate machinery of the cell. That makes sense for the inside of the cells, but what about the outside? Don't their organs still freeze? Well, that's the fascinating part. The glucose actually allows ice to form outside the cells. So they're like encased in ice. Pretty much. Their organs get surrounded by ice. Their eyes even turn white from a frozen lens. Whoa. But inside the cells, thanks to the glucose, everything's protected and stable. So we've got a frog that's basically a frog-sicle, heart stopped, no breathing, frozen for months. It's like something out of a sci-fi movie, cryosleep or something. Exactly. And here's where it gets even more mind-blowing. When spring rolls around, they thaw out from the inside out. Wait, what? Yep. First the heart, then the brain, then they start moving again. That's incredible. A true resurrection. And scientists still aren't completely sure how that heart restart works after being totally stopped for so long. Right. I mean, this little frog is basically hitting pause on its life and then coming back like nothing happened. It's wild. There's got to be more to this story. How does it all work at the cellular level? So each cell in the wood frog's body, you can think of it like a tiny, intricate machine. Okay, I like that analogy. When ice crystals form inside a cell, it's like throwing a wrench in the gears. Yeah. Everything grinds to a halt. Makes sense. And the damage, it can be irreversible. So the glucose is basically like a shield protecting the delicate machinery of the cells. Exactly. Protecting them from those ice crystal wrenches. But it's not just about preventing ice crystals. The glucose also helps the cells stay hydrated during the freezing process. Hydrated? Why does that matter? See, when ice forms, it pulls water away from the surrounding areas. Oh, right, right. So the cells can actually shrivel up and die. But the glucose acts like a sponge, holding onto that water and preventing dehydration. Okay, that makes sense. But I got to say, the whole blood sugar thing still boggles my mind. I mean, we're talking about levels that would put a human in a diabetic coma, right? Ten cans of soda worth of sugar coursing through your veins. Exactly. How do they handle that and not, you know, just keel over? That, my friend, is one of the big mysteries researchers are trying to unravel. It seems they've evolved ways to protect their proteins and organs from damage that high blood sugar would normally cause in, say, humans. So, theoretically, studying wood frogs could lead to breakthroughs in diabetes treatment. It's a really promising area of research. Imagine if we could figure out how they tolerate those extreme blood sugar levels. Could potentially lead to new therapies for managing diabetes. I mean, a future where people with diabetes don't have to constantly monitor their blood sugar, don't have to worry about all the complications. Yes, the dream, right? That would be huge. Okay, but back to the whole freezing thing. It's not just about surviving the winter, right? I remember you mentioned something about an advantage in the spring. You got a good memory. Remember how we talked about other frogs hibernating underwater? When spring arrives, land thaws out faster than those deep lakes and ponds. Makes sense. So the wood frog, they get a head start, up and hopping weeks before the others even emerge. So it's like a strategy. They choose a riskier winter setup, but then they get the payoff of being first to the breeding grounds come spring. It's a gamble. Yeah. But it seems to be working for them. They're taking advantage of this window of opportunity before the... Before the what? The fish. Fish? What do fish have to do with it? Yes. The vernal pools. The vernal pools? What are those? They're these temporary puddles that form in the spring. From the snowmelt and rain, right? Exactly. And then they dry up later in the summer. So not just any old puddles. What's so special about these vernal pools? Think of them like ecological pop-up nurseries. Pop-up nursery? Okay, that's kind of cute. They appear suddenly, teeming with life, and then disappear just as quickly. So what? They're only around for a short time. Right, and here's the key. Fish can't survive in them. Because they dry up. Yep. Makes them a haven for amphibian eggs and tadpoles. Ah, so it's all about finding a safe place to raise their young. Even if it means taking a gamble on this temporary water source. Exactly. So it's not just about the adults surviving, it's about the next generation, too. Smart. But if these pools dry up so fast, how do the tadpoles even have time to, you know, become frogs? Another amazing adaptation. Their tadpoles develop super fast. Like how fast? Sometimes they go from tadpole to froglet in just four weeks. Wow, that's a crash course in frog development. A race against time. They gotta grow up before their nursery vanishes. It's incredible how evolution shapes life to fit these specific little niches, isn't it? But okay, let's shift gears for a second. This whole freezing thing, it's not just a cool biological trick, right? You're right, there's so much more to it. I mean, I remember you saying something about the wood frog maybe holding the key to some pretty major medical breakthroughs for us humans. Oh, absolutely. One area that has scientists really excited is organ transplantation. Organ transplantation? What, like how to keep organs viable for longer? Exactly. Right now, donor organs have a very limited shelf life to be transported and transplanted so quickly. And, you know, lots of organs end up going to waste because they just can't get to a recipient in time. So are you saying we could learn how to freeze human organs without damaging them? Like the wood frog does? It's a long-term goal, for sure. But the potential is there. Imagine being able to extend the shelf life of organs dramatically, making transplants more accessible, saving countless lives. That would be amazing. Revolutionary, really. Wait, I think you said cryopreserve before? Oh, yeah, cryopreservation. What exactly does that mean? It's the process of freezing biological material, like cells or tissues, but in a way that prevents damage. So not just checking them in the freezer? No, no, definitely not. Lots of science involved. But the wood frog, they're like a living
