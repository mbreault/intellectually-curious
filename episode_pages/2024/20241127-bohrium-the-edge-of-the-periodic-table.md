## Description

A deep dive into Bohrium, element 107: its lab-created birth in the 1970s, how scientists confirmed its existence, and the famous naming debate. We unpack isotopes, the six-atom chemical experiment, and Bohriumâ€™s surprisingly normal chemistry for a superheavy elementâ€”plus the relativistic quirks that could upend our ideas about the periodic table. A story of precision, controversy, and the hunt to push chemistry to heavier frontiers.

## Transcript

All right. So today we're diving deep into bohrium. Bohrium. Element number 107, BH. And you've given me some pretty interesting sources here. A mix of personal notes, scientific papers. Yeah. I thought it'd be fun to kind of see what we could find out about bohrium. Exactly. A synthetic element. Yeah. Which right off the bat is kind of fascinating. We're not talking about an element that you're going to like find out in nature. Right. This is something that scientists figured out how to create by smashing atoms together. So no digging in a mine for this one. Nope. This one's all lab created. And it looks like the story starts with some Soviet scientists back in 1976. Yeah. A team led by Yuri Oganeshin at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna. Dubna. And they bombarded bismuth with chromium ions. Okay. Specifically bismuth 209 with chromium 54. Right. And they believe they created bohrium 261. Okay. But it was unbelievably fleeting. Fleeting. What does that mean? Like how fleeting are we talking about? It has a half-life of one to two milliseconds. So imagine trying to study something that is there and gone basically as fast as you can blink. So not something you can hold in your hand. And I'm guessing because of that short lifespan there was some skepticism around it. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. It wasn't actually until 1992 that the International Union of Purity Applied Chemistry, the IUP, essentially the governing body for chemistry, officially acknowledged the discovery. So you're talking about a 15, over 15 year gap. Wow. What convinced, was it just more evidence or did somebody else take a different tack at it? Well, there was a confirmation done in 1981 by a German team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Mensenberg at the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt. Wow. They definitely like to make those names long. Yes, they do. And they used a similar technique, a marting bismuth 209 with chromium 54. But they created a slightly different isotope, bohrium 262. Okay. So same element, slightly different atomic structure. Exactly. Was that more stable or was there something else about that that made it easier to study? It wasn't necessarily more stable. Okay. But what they did is they very meticulously measured what's called its alpha decay chain. So basically tracking how it breaks down step by step. Yeah. And they were able to link it back to known isotopes of fermium and the californium. Ah, so it's like a family tree. Yeah, like a family tree. And that was a really big piece of evidence to convince people like, okay, this is really there. Gotcha. But then it gets even more interesting because even the naming of the element was controversial. Oh, so there was even debate over what to call it? Oh, yeah. Okay. The German team proposed the name Nielsborium to honor Niels Bohr. Right, right. And they even suggested the symbol N's for it. N's, okay. I assume IUPAC had other ideas, though? Yeah, they actually preferred just bohrium. Just bohrium. With the symbol BH. BH. So a bit simpler. And this led to a five-year debate in the scientific community. A five-year debate over the name. Over the name. What was the, I guess, the reasoning for IUPAC to push back on Niels Bohr? Well, they argued that using a scientist's full name for an element was unprecedented and could lead to, you know, problems down the road with other elements being named. All right. And also they were worried about potential confusion with boron. Oh, okay. Which is a much lighter element, very different properties. Yeah, I wouldn't want to mix those up, especially in a lab setting. No. So did they win? They did. In 1997, bohrium became the official name. Bohrium, okay. Interestingly, the Danish branch of the IUPAC actually voted in favor of the shorter name. Oh, wow. Perhaps a bit of national pride there for Niels Bohr. Yeah, maybe so. Okay, so we've settled on the name. But what about the element itself? I know you mentioned isotopes earlier. Are there different versions of bohrium? Yeah, absolutely. Since its initial discovery, scientists have created a number of different bohrium isotopes in the lab. So isotopes are kind of like siblings of an element. Yeah, exactly. They have the same number of protons, which defines the element, but a different number of neutrons. Like carbon-12 and carbon-14. Exactly. Same element, different weights. Precisely. Okay, so what about bohrium's isotopes? Well, they've created isotopes with masses ranging from 260 to 278. Okay. But here's the thing. All of them are radioactive. Okay. And most of them have extremely short half-lives. Okay, so back to that problem of studying something that disappears really quickly. Exactly. You're talking milliseconds, seconds. Now, I noticed in the notes that they're still using that chromium-54 bombardment method to create these isotopes. Why stick with that if they're so hard to study? Well, it really comes down to the power and the precision of modern nuclear physics. Okay. These experiments are incredibly complex. They require huge amounts of energy to force those nuclei to fuse together. Right. But by very carefully adjusting the conditions, they can create different bohrium isotopes. Okay. And study, you know, how they behave. Okay, so they're making these very, very fleeting bohrium isotopes. But what can we actually say about bohrium itself? What do we think it looks like? Well, you might be surprised to hear that we can make some predictions about that. Okay. And that's because of where it sits on the periodic table. Right. Bohrium is right below manganese, technetium, and rhenium. Okay. In group seven. So it's in that same family. Right. And based on that, we expect it to behave like a typical transition metal. So kind of like family resemblance. Right. Like if your siblings are tall, there's a good chance you're going to be tall, too. Exactly. So what does that mean for bohrium? Well, for example, we expect it to be a solid at room temperature. Okay. And it should have a kind of shiny metallic appearance. Interesting. So it's not like some radioactive blob. It's a shiny, radioactive solid. Okay. But how can we be so sure about its chemical behavior if it's so hard to study? That's a great question. And to answer that, we have to jump ahead to the year 2000. Okay. When some researchers at the Paul Scherer Institute did something pretty incredible. Okay. They actually managed to study the chemical behavior of bohrium using just six atoms. Six atoms. Six atoms. Wow. How is that even possible? It took amazing ingenuity and very specialized techniques. Yeah. So to explain this, we need to talk about what a volatile oxychloride is. Okay. A volatile what? A volatile oxychloride. Oxychloride. Basically, it's a compound that very easily transitions into a gas. Okay. So it's something that likes to turn into a gas. Right. So what they did is they took those six goryum atoms, specifically bohrium 267, and they reacted them with hydrochloric acid and oxygen. Okay. And this produced a volatile bohrium oxychloride. Okay. And here's the brilliant part. By comparing this compound to the oxychlorides of technetium and rhenium, you know, those lighter relatives in group seven. Right, right. They were able to confirm that bohrium actually acts just like we would expect a member of group seven to act. So they used this tiny, tiny, tiny amount of bohrium, a compound that likes to become a gas, and a comparison to its relatives. Right. And that's how they figured out its chemical personality. Exactly. That's incredible detective work. It really is. Now, I do remember you mentioning earlier that relativistic effects come into play with super heavy elements. Yes. I mean, what are we talking about there? What is that? So the electrons in these heavy atoms are moving around the nucleus at speeds that approach the speed of light. And that leads to some really bizarre behavior that we don't see in lighter elements. Okay, so things are getting a little mind-bending here. Yeah, we're getting into some really weird stuff. Like what kind of bizarre behavior are we talking about? So, for instance, some studies have suggested that bohrium might actually defy expectations when it comes to its electron configuration. Okay. And that it might give up an electron from its sixth pen orbital before its seventh orbital. So not exactly behaving as predicted based on its lighter siblings. Exactly, and this is what makes studying these super heavy elements so fascinating. They're really pushing the boundaries of what we understand about chemistry. So they're kind of like the rule breakers of the periodic table. Yeah, they're always challenging our assumptions. So where does this leave us with bohrium then? I mean, we've got this radioactive, shiny element that's not quite following all the rules. What's the big takeaway? I think the big takeaway is that even in the realm of these super heavy synthetic elements, the fundamental principles of chemistry, like periodic trends, they still have a really powerful influence. But there are surprises. Right. And that leads to a bigger question. What happens as we create even heavier elements? Do the rules of chemistry eventually break down? Yeah, I mean
