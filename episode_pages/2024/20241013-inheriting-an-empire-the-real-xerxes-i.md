From Spartan-backed legitimacy to the looming Persian Wars, this episode unpacks the pressures, decisions, and enduring legacy of one of antiquity's most consequential rulers.

## Transcript

Imagine inheriting an empire. Not just some small country, but a real massive empire. One built up over generations. Talk about pressure. That's Xerxes I for you. Yeah, stepping into those shoes, following in the footsteps of giants, trying to live up to that legacy. Definitely not your average inheritance. And that's exactly what we're diving into today. The life and times of Xerxes I. Gotta go beyond the whole villain thing you see in movies, right? Right, it's about getting a more complete picture. We've got some great sources to help with that. Excerpts from Timeline and Xerxes' Wikipedia entry just to start. Perfect for a deep dive then. So we always picture these ancient rulers, these kings, as having these crazy luxurious upbringings. But Xerxes' childhood, even as a prince, it wasn't all feasts and games, was it? Oh, not at all. I mean, it was definitely privileged, but there was a system in place, a very specific way of raising future rulers. We see it in sources like Xenophon and first Elphabaides. It's all about molding them through rigorous training. Like, what kind of training are we talking about? Think about physical training, learning to ride, becoming expert hunters. And it wasn't just about learning to hunt for sport. It was about strategy, understanding the land, connecting with the empire on a different level. Ah, so it's like a real-life version of those hero training montages you see in movies. But instead of, like, lifting logs and stuff, it's all these skills a ruler would need. Exactly. And a huge part of it was mandatory military service. Even as a prince, Xerxes had to earn his stripes, prove himself alongside other soldiers. It wasn't just about inheriting power. It was about understanding the weight of it, the responsibility to those he would one day command. So we're talking about traditions passed down for centuries, shaping Persian rulers long before Xerxes. It makes you think, like, what was going through his head, this young prince being prepared for such a massive role? And it's not just speculation. We see these traditions reflected in later rulers, like Abbas the Great, which shows just how deeply ingrained they were in Persian culture. But before we get too far ahead of ourselves, before he's even on the throne, there's the whole issue of Xerxes actually becoming king. It's 486 BC, Darius the Great, Xerxes' father, dies. You know what happens next? The scramble for power begins. Right, because it's never a simple transfer of power, is it? Especially with an empire that big, someone's always waiting in the wings, ready to challenge the heir apparent. Oh, absolutely. And Xerxes had a rival, his older half-brother, Artabaz√°n. This wasn't just a minor family feud. This was a full-blown succession dispute with the fate of the empire hanging in the balance. Game of Thrones, ancient Persia edition. So how does this play out? I mean, does Artabaz√°n just, like, concede defeat? Not a chance. See, Artabaz√°n, he was older, right? So he believed he had a strong claim based on seniority. Makes sense on the surface. Yeah, classic oldest child argument. But Xerxes, he had a few things going for him too, didn't he? Oh, for sure. He was the son of Darius and Atossa. Now, Atossa was a direct descendant of Cyrus the Great. We're talking about the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, a lineage that carried serious weight. Tough act to follow, founding an empire like that. Talk about pressure. So Xerxes had the bloodline on his side. But it gets even more interesting. There was this whole Spartan king situation, right? Yeah, this is where it gets really wild. So there's this Spartan king, in exile at the time, who happens to be in Persia during all of this. And get this, he ends up backing Xerxes. A Spartan king in Persia helping decide who gets the throne. It's a lot to unpack. What was his reasoning? It seems a little counterintuitive given the whole, you know, Persia-Greece rivalry thing. Right. But this Spartan king, he actually points to Spartan law. And Spartan law favored the first son born after a king's ascension to the throne. This born in the purple concept, it held a lot of weight, even internationally, apparently. So his backing gave Xerxes even more legitimacy. So not only does he have the lineage, he's got this foreign ruler vouching for him based on, of all things, Spartan tradition. Exactly. And it shows Xerxes' ability to navigate these complex political situations. He wasn't just handed the throne. He had to secure it, proving his strategic thinking right off the bat. But even with a secure claim and a Spartan king in his corner, something tells me things weren't about to get any easier for Xerxes. Oh, you're telling me. Ruling an empire that size, it came with a whole new set of challenges. And those challenges, well, let's just say they weren't afraid to test a new king. Yeah, talk about a trial by fire. I mean, think about it. You finally secure the throne, right? You're the ruler of this vast empire stretching from Egypt to India. But it's not like everyone just says, OK, cool, you're in charge now. More like they're all watching, waiting to see how you handle the pressure. And history's full of examples of what happens when a new ruler isn't, you know, up to the task. Exactly. And for Xerxes, that pressure cooker moment came pretty quickly in the form of two major revolts. Talk about a baptism by fire. The first one kicks off in Egypt, 486 BC. Seems like they weren't too keen on Persian rule at the time. Egypt, always a hotbed for rebellion, even back then. What do we know about this uprising? Was it just like a minor squabble or did it pose a serious threat to Xerxes? Oh, this was a serious challenge. The sources suggest that Xerxes actually had to lead the army himself to put it down. Wow. So he's not just delegating. He's on the front lines. A bold move for a new ruler. What do you think? Showing strength or a necessary risk? Probably a bit of both, if you ask me. He had to prove he wasn't just some figurehead, especially after that whole succession thing. And it worked. By 484 BC, the rebellion was crushed and Xerxes installed his own brother, Achimenes, as satrap of Egypt. Smart move. Keep your friends close, your potential rivals even closer, especially when they're family. But before he could even catch his breath, another revolt breaks out, right? This time, it's Babylon causing trouble. Yeah, Babylon, always a thorn in the side of empires. This time, the ringleader was a guy named Shamash Arriba. What makes this rebellion different from the one in Egypt? Well, this one was much more than just a quick uprising. Shamash Arriba, he was organized. He managed to capture Babylon itself and a bunch of the surrounding cities. So we're talking about a real strategic threat, not just a minor nuisance. Exactly. Shamash Arriba held onto those territories for months, which must have been a logistical nightmare for Xerxes. It was a direct challenge to his authority right when he was trying to solidify his grip on the empire. I mean, two major rebellions in just a few years. It makes you wonder if those around him underestimated him, saw him as weak after that whole succession battle with his brother. Oh, absolutely. And it's these challenges, these early tests of his leadership, that really paint a more complex picture of Xerxes. He wasn't just some spoiled prince who inherited an empire. He had to fight for it, both on the battlefield and within his own borders. It's like those trials they make heroes go through in mythology, except this is real life with real consequences. So how did these rebellions shape his rule? Did he become like a more ruthless leader, cracking down on any sign of dissent? It's interesting. We do see some administrative changes. Like, after the Babylonian rebellion, he splits the Babylonian satrapy into smaller, more manageable units. Some historians see this as a way to consolidate control, but others argue it reflects a more nuanced approach to governing such a diverse empire. Divide and conquer, but also maybe a way to prevent future rebellions from gaining too much steam. It's a reminder that even those seemingly straightforward decisions a ruler makes, they can have these huge ripple effects across the empire. Oh yeah, for sure. Every action has a reaction, especially when you're dealing with an empire that vast and complex. But of course, when we talk about Xerxes, it's impossible to ignore the shadow of war looming large. Those Persian wars, they cast a long shadow over his reign. Yeah, that's what he's most known for, at least in popular culture. You know, those epic movies with the Spartans and all that. Right, and those stories, they tend to paint him as the villain, this power-hungry tyrant who throws everything he's got at Greece. But the reality, as always, is a lot more complicated than that. The Persian wars were a clash of titans. Two completely different cultures and ways of life going head to head. And it wasn't just a simple case of Persia versus Greece, was it? Not at all. Xerxes commanded one of the largest and most diverse armies the world had ever seen. We're talking soldiers from all corners of the Achaemenid Empire. Egyptians, Babylonians, Medes, even Greeks from certain city-states that allied with Persia. Can you imagine the logistical nightmare of managing an army that diverse? Different languages, different
