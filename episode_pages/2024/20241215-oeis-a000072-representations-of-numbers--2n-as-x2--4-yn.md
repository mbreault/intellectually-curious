A guided tour of A000072, the sequence counting how many positive integers up to 2^n can be written in the form x^2 + 4 y^n. We explore the number-theory and computational ideas behind the rule, including Gaussian integers, growth patterns, and PARI/GP code, and we touch on Sloanâ€™s Handbook of Integer Sequences and the broader connections to discrete math and algorithms.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone, to another deep dive into the OEIS database. We're going to continue our exploration of these really fascinating numerical sequences. And today we've got A000072 ready to go. It's one of those sequences that might seem kind of simple when you first look at it, but it can get pretty interesting mathematically pretty quick. Yeah, it really is a great example of how you can start with a simple rule and it opens up all these doors to like deeper math ideas, like number theory and algorithms and stuff. OK, so let's start at the beginning. What exactly is A000072? What's the rule? So this sequence, it counts how many positive integers there are that are less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of n. And those integers have to be able to be written in the form x^2 plus 4y^n. OK, so we've got exponents and we've got equations already. I feel like some of our listeners might need a little more help understanding this. Can we maybe walk through like a quick example? Sure. So let's just pick a value for let's say n3. So 2 to the power of 3, that's 8. Right. So then what we need to do is find all the positive integers that are less than or equal to 8 that also fit that form x^2 plus 4y^n. So we're basically trying different values for x and y and seeing if what we get is less than or equal to 8. Exactly. And when we do that for n3, we end up with 4 numbers, 1, 4, 5, and 8, for example. Like the number 5, we can write that as 1 on naught plus 4y^1 on naught. So that fits our pattern perfectly. Ah, I see. Okay. So the sequence A000072 would have the number 4 as its entry for n equals 3. Yeah. So it's like each value of n gives us a different little mathematical puzzle to solve. Yeah, exactly. And as n increases, it gets more complex. Obviously, the number of integers that fit the form is going to grow too, which is what makes analyzing this sequence so interesting. Yeah. In the notes for this episode, they mentioned a few deeper mathematical connections to this sequence. Can you maybe talk a little bit about those? Like why is this sequence, it seems pretty simple on the surface, why is it considered so important? Well, this sequence, it really gives us a window into some really fundamental mathematical concepts. For one, it's really closely tied to number theory. Number theory, the study of integers and how they're related. I can definitely see that connection. Yeah, right. And A000072, it really digs into how integers can be represented using certain quadratic forms, like in this case, x^2 plus 4y^n. This specific form is actually related to something called Gaussian integers, which are complex numbers where both the real and the imaginary parts are integers. Oh, so instead of 2 plus 3i, it's like 5 plus 2i where both parts are whole numbers. How does that tie back to this sequence, though? Well, the connection is really in how certain prime numbers act in the world of Gaussian integers. But honestly, that's probably a whole other deep dive in itself. You're probably right. We'll put that on the list. Okay, but sticking with the broader connections, our notes also mentioned sequences and series. Well, A000072 is a sequence itself. Mathematicians are interested in how it behaves as a whole, like how fast does it grow? Are there any patterns we can find? How does it relate to other sequences? This kind of analysis is what we call discrete mathematics. Oh, okay. So it's not just about figuring out the individual terms in the sequence. It's about seeing the big picture, the trends and the relationships that pop up. It's almost like when you analyze a stock market graph, looking for patterns that can help you predict what's going to happen in the future. Yeah, that's actually a pretty good analogy. Okay, so our notes also talk about algorithms. I see there's a snippet of PARI code in the source material. What's that all about? Yeah, it sounds like we're moving away from pure math and getting into the realm of computing now. Right. So that little piece of PARI code, it basically gives a computer instructions on how to calculate the terms in A000072. It just highlights how we can look at this sequence from a computational point of view. So it's not just theoretical math. It's about how to actually compute these numbers in a practical way. I guess this is where computer science starts to overlap with number theory. Yeah, exactly. Algorithms like this are super important when we want to explore huge sets of data and test out mathematical ideas about sequences like A000072. Now, before we keep going, I want to point out that A000072 is actually featured in Sloan's handbooks of integer sequences. That's got to be a big deal. Yeah, definitely. That means that this sequence has caught the eye of some serious mathematicians. It's earned its spot in those really important reference books. Okay, so before we really dive deep into A000072, I want to bring up one observation. The way this sequence is defined, it kind of puts some limits on what values X and Y can have, right? You're exactly right. Because the integers have to be less than or equal to 2 to the power of N, that automatically limits what you can plug in for X and Y in that X plus 4Y formula. Right. Yeah, so it's like this constraint adds a whole other level of complexity to figuring out this sequence, right? It ties the growth of N to the combinations of X and Y you can use. It really does. It's like this dynamic relationship between N and Y that makes exploring the sequence so rewarding, I think. Yeah, I think so too. Okay, so for our listeners out there who are maybe just hearing about A000072 for the first time, why should they care? Why are these connections to all these different math concepts so important? Well, I think it shows how something that looks pretty simple at first, like a simple rule, can actually lead to some really complex and really cool math. It also shows how those math ideas, even the ones that seem really abstract, can have practical uses too. Right. It's like A000072 is a gateway to these deeper concepts. You don't need to know a ton about Gaussian integers or fancy algorithms to get something out of it. Exactly. It's all about sparking that curiosity and making people want to explore more. It highlights how different areas of math are all connected in a way. And it's a good reminder that math isn't just about memorizing formulas and doing calculations. It's about finding patterns and relationships and, like you said, that thrill of discovery. And like we mentioned before, the fact that this sequence is included in Sloan's handbooks of integer sequences, that says a lot about how important it is, right? Oh, yeah, absolutely. It means it's worth studying and investigating more. It's not just some random sequence. Yeah. It's like we're taking this thing that seems simple at first and we're unpacking it. We're showing all the beauty and complexity that's hidden underneath. Yeah. We're giving our listeners a shortcut to understanding not only what A000072 is, but also why it matters in the big picture of math. And hopefully we're making them curious enough to dig deeper into these really cool areas of math themselves. Okay. So to recap, we've been talking about A000072, the sequence that counts positive integers that are less than or equal to a power of 2 and that can be written in the form x^6 plus 4y^5. Right. We've talked about how it connects to number theory sequences and series and even algorithms. We've seen that it's an important sequence in all kinds of different math areas. And we've talked about how this simple rule opens up a whole world of deeper math to explore. We even touched on how the way the sequence is defined, it kind of limits what you can use for x and y, which adds another layer of complexity. Yeah, it does. Here's a question for our listeners to think about. We've been talking about how the number of integers that fit this x plus 4y form, how that number grows as n grows. What if we went a little deeper, though? What if we looked at the patterns in that growth? Could those patterns tell us something even more fundamental about how numbers that can be represented in this specific form, how they're distributed? So it's not just how many numbers fit the form, but how they're spread out, how their density changes as we look at bigger and bigger powers of 2. Exactly. It ties back to everything we've talked about. Number theory, sequences, algorithms. Maybe there's some hidden structure there waiting to be found, some clue to an even deeper math truth. Yeah, that's a pretty awesome thought to leave our listeners with, a little bit of mystery to keep those STEM minds thinking. For our listeners who are ready to take the plunge themselves, the OEIS entry for A000072 is a great place to start. It's full of details, references, and even that PARI code we mentioned. And remember, the world of integer sequences is massive. There's so much to explore out there. Who knows what kind of math treasures you might find on your next deep dive? Until next time, keep crunching those numbers and keep that curiosity going. So it's like we're going from just counting these special numbers to actually trying to figure out where they live on the number line. Exactly. It's like if you were plotting these numbers on a number line, as height gets bigger, you're adding more and more points, but they all have to follow that rule, x mod plus 4y1
