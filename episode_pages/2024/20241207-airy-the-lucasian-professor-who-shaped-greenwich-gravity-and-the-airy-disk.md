## Transcript

Welcome back for another deep dive into the fascinating history of the Lucasian Professors of Mathematics. This time we're on episode 11 and we're going to be focusing on Sir George Biddle Airy, the 10th person to hold this position. Wow, the 10th? Yeah. That's pretty far back. I know, it's amazing, right? So you might not know his name, but you definitely benefit from his work, especially if you use GPS or rely on accurate timekeeping. It's remarkable how someone who lived before computers and modern physics could have such a lasting impact. His work on planetary orbits and the Earth's density, just to name a few, are still relevant today. Right. And we have quite a collection of sources for this deep dive. We've got Airy's Wikipedia biography, excerpts from his writings, and even accounts of the Tay Bridge disaster, which we'll discuss later. Oh, right, the Tay Bridge disaster. Yeah. So our mission today is to uncover not only Airy's impressive achievements in astronomy, mathematics, and engineering, but also to explore some of the controversies that surrounded him. I think that's crucial to understanding any scientist, really. You know, to truly grasp their contribution, you've got to look at both the triumphs and the setbacks. And Airy's life offers a very compelling case study in this regard. Yeah, I'm really excited to get into all that. So let's start with his early life and career. He was born in 1801. And from a young age, he showed a remarkable aptitude for mathematics. You know, it's almost cliche, isn't it? The brilliant mathematician from a young age. Right. But yeah, he was one of them. He excelled at Cambridge, became a fellow at Trinity College, and even held the Lucasian professorship for a time. Oh, wow. So he held the very position that this entire podcast is about. He did, yeah. Yes, it's amazing, right? The history of this professorship is just incredible. It really is. And it's interesting how Airy's ambition extended beyond academia. You know, he wanted to make a real-world impact, and that desire led him to become astronomer royal in 1835. The astronomer royal. That title just sounds so grand. What did it actually entail? Well, it was a very prestigious position, of course, but it also came with significant responsibilities. So Airy was in charge of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. And he really took it upon himself to completely modernize the institution. Oh, wow. Yeah. He revamped their systems, introduced new instruments. Essentially, he transformed Greenwich into a world-leading scientific hub. That's incredible. And on top of that, he also found time to publish countless scientific papers on topics ranging from optics to planetary motion. This guy was clearly a machine. He was. He was definitely not one to rest on his laurels. No, not at all. And one example that really highlights his ingenuity is his work on determining the Earth's mean density. He devised an experiment to measure gravity at the top and bottom of a deep mine. So he literally went deep to understand our planet. He did, yeah. That's great. Pretty cool, right? Yeah. So by comparing the subtle differences in gravity using pendulums at different depths, he was able to calculate the Earth's density with remarkable accuracy for his time. I mean, that's just brilliant. Yeah. And speaking of accuracy, Airy is also known for the Airy disk, a concept with implications for fields like telescopes and even the debate about geocentrism. Ah, yes, the Airy disk. So the Airy disk is a fundamental principle in optics. It explains why even the most perfect lens can't focus light to a single point. Because of a phenomenon called diffraction, light bends around obstacles, creating a small blurry disk instead of a sharp point image. So even with perfect equipment, there's a natural limit to how sharp an image can be. Exactly. And Airy provided the first full theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, which was really crucial for understanding the limitations of optical instruments. Wow. And how does this tie into the debate about geocentrism, the idea that the Earth is the center of the universe? Well, one argument for geocentrism was based on the apparent size of stars. Early telescopes with their small apertures showed stars as disks of a certain size. And this led some to believe that stars were enormously large and far away, which seemed incompatible with the Earth revolving around the sun. So they were basically using an optical illusion as evidence. Well, unknowingly, yes. That's kind of ironic. It is. But Airy's work, along with better telescopes and eventually the detection of stellar parallax, you know, that apparent shift in a star's position when viewed from different locations, it firmly established that the Earth is not the center of the universe. Right. It's amazing how a seemingly simple physics concept can have such profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos. Absolutely. Airy's work often had these ripple effects across various scientific disciplines. And speaking of cosmological implications, Airy also played a controversial role in the discovery of Neptune, which adds another layer to his legacy in astronomy. Yeah, this is where things get a bit more complex. So Airy was approached by John Couch Adams, a young Cambridge mathematician. And Adams had calculated the likely position of a new planet based on irregularities in Uranus's orbit. So irregularities in a known planet's orbit suggested the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet. That's the idea that Adams was pursuing. He presented his findings to Airy, who was initially skeptical, but he eventually asked James Challis to search for the planet. Okay, but it sounds like there's more to this story. There is. Another astronomer, Urbain Le Verrier, had independently made similar calculations. And he convinced Johann Galle in Berlin to search, and Galle found Neptune first. Oh, wow. Yeah, much to the chagrin of many in Britain who felt that Adams, and by extension, Airy, had been robbed of the discovery. So Airy's caution, or maybe his reluctance to fully embrace Adams' work, cost Britain a major scientific victory. That's certainly one interpretation. However, to be fair to Airy, Adams' initial communications were quite vague. And, you know, searching for a new planet wasn't technically the astronomer royal's job. Right. It's fascinating to consider how different the history of astronomy might be if circumstances had played out differently. Absolutely. I mean, this whole episode highlights the complex interplay of scientific discovery, personal interactions, and, you know, these institutional structures. It's not always a straightforward path. It really isn't. And speaking of Airy's influence on shaping scientific institutions, his work establishing the prime meridian at Greenwich was a significant win for Britain. Oh, absolutely. Airy was instrumental in persuading the international community to adopt the Greenwich Meridian as the zero-degree longitude line. So every time we use GPS or look at a map with longitude lines, we're essentially using Airy's system. Exactly. That's quite a legacy. It is. His work has had a lasting impact on navigation, cartography, and our understanding of timekeeping. It's clear that Airy was a brilliant scientist and a savvy administrator, someone who really understood the importance of establishing standards and systems. But as we mentioned earlier, there's also the Tay Bridge disaster, which casts a bit of a shadow over his legacy. Yes, the Tay Bridge collapse is a tragic reminder that even the most brilliant minds can make mistakes, and the consequences can be profound. Right, so let's delve into that chapter next to gain a complete picture of Airy's life and work. It's crucial to understand how even amidst great achievements, human fallibility can have a significant impact. Definitely. It's a valuable lesson for anyone in a position of authority, particularly in fields where decisions can have far-reaching consequences. So the Tay Bridge disaster really was a pivotal moment in bridge design and engineering. It exposed the limitations of, well, I guess you could say our understanding of wind forces at the time, and it emphasized the need for more rigorous testing and analysis in these kinds of projects. So this tragedy, while obviously devastating, ultimately led to improvements in bridge safety and, I guess, a deeper understanding of how structures interact with their environment. Precisely. The Royal Commission on Wind Pressure, which was established in the wake of the disaster, conducted extensive research that informed future bridge designs and construction standards. It's fascinating how these terrible events can often spur such significant progress. It's a bittersweet outcome, but progress nonetheless. Yeah. So what was Airy's response to all of this? I mean, he faced some intense scrutiny and criticism following the bridge collapse. He did. But Airy remained steadfast in his calculations and defended his work before the inquiry. He acknowledged the tragic outcome, of course, but he stood by his assessment of the wind pressures he believed the bridge could withstand. I can only imagine how difficult that must have been, to maintain that position knowing that his advice had contributed to such a terrible loss of life. Absolutely. It raises complex questions about scientific accountability and the weight of expert opinion in engineering projects. It's a heavy burden to bear. It is. And it also underscores the human element that's inherent in all scientific endeavors. Even someone as brilliant as Airy was still susceptible to error. That's right. It's a humbling reminder that science is a continuous process, not a definitive end point, and even the most respected authorities can make mistakes. Right. Despite this tragedy, though, we can't overlook the sheer breadth and impact of Airy's work, right? He made significant contributions to numerous scientific disciplines, you know, including astronomy, mathematics, optics, and geophysics. Absolutely. His work on the lunar theory, for instance, is a prime example. He devised a novel approach to calculating the moon's motions, which was a task of incredible complexity. It took him
