## Description

A deep dive into the strange life of Clippyâ€”the Office Assistant that haunted early computers, became a meme, and now resurfaces in every corner of tech culture. Why was he created? Why did we hate him? And why are we embracing him again? We explore the psychology of humanâ€“computer interaction, the power of defaults, and what Clippy's revival says about nostalgia and our evolving relationship with technology.

## Transcript

You know, it's weird, some tech just sticks with you even if you hated it at the time. Like Clippy. You sent in, well, some really fascinating stuff about Clippy, excerpts from his Wikipedia page, always a classic, and this fantastically titled piece from Seattle Met, The Twisted Life of Clippy. Oh, wow. You must be dying to know what's really going on with this paperclip, right? And honestly, me too. I mean, we all think we know Clippy. Annoying, right? The paperclip that just wouldn't quit. Right. But why was he even created? Why did everyone seem to just hate him? Totally. And maybe the weirdest thing is, why is Clippy back? Yeah, that is weird. You know, Clippy is a great example of how even a, what do you call it, a tech fail, I guess, can still have this huge impact on culture, you know? Like Microsoft, they wanted to make computers less scary, right? And he kind of became like the face of digital anxiety. But he's back. Right. It's like he's back to haunt us, but in a weird way, kind of endearing. So, okay, Clippy. He was supposed to make computers less scary. Right. But what was so scary about computers back then? I know, right? Did they like make scary noises when you turned them on? What was going on? The Seattle Met article, it talks about people crying, like literally crying. Oh, wow. Trying to use like Microsoft Publisher. Imagine like trying to learn Canva these days or whatever and just like breaking down in tears. It's hard to imagine, I guess. Yeah. But back then, computers, they were really like a whole new world. This is before the internet was everywhere, right? Right. Like before, even before most people had email. Yeah. Like there was no Google. You couldn't just like Google something. Right, right. You just had to like figure it out. Oh, so you're just staring at that blank screen with the blinking cursor. Exactly. And it was terrifying. So is that where Clippy came in? Out of pity? What? Like a digital shoulder to cry on? Not exactly. I mean, they brought in, you know, like some big names in psychology, like Clifford Nass, Byron Reeves. These guys were like studying how we like interact with computers. And their research showed that people, we can't help it. We just, we treat computers like people, even though, you know, like even when we know they're not, we give them personalities, right? Right. We talk to them. We, you know, we get mad at them. Oh, for sure. You probably yelled at your computer at some point. Oh, absolutely. So Microsoft was like, why even fight it? Right. Let's just give everyone a little buddy. Oh, okay. To guide them, you know. Like a little digital friend. Right. And that's how you got Microsoft Bob. Microsoft Bob. That was the cartoon dog lived inside your computer. Yeah. There's something kind of like charming about that now when you look back at it. Oh, yeah. Like it's kind of cute, but I can see how. It was a valiant effort, definitely. Yeah. But people just weren't ready for it. They weren't ready for that. No. They wanted help. Just not that much help. Not a cartoon dog. Okay. So that brings us back to Clippy. How did they even land on a paperclip? Right. Like of all the things. Of all the things. And this detail from the article, it's kind of funny. Okay. What's that? His creator, Kevon Atteberry. Yeah. He designed Clippy on a Mac. What? Yeah. The irony. Right. But I mean, that just goes to show you, even tech rivals, they can accidentally make something that sticks around. That's true. That's true. But speaking of sticking around, how did Clippy become the digital assistant? Right. Like, I mean, the article mentions this, this bouncing red ball, this know-it-all genius. Right. Why Clippy? Well, you know, Clippy was the default. The default. The default assistant for lots of users. And you know how it is. People rarely change the default settings. Oh, yeah. So even though there were other options. Right. Clippy became the face of Microsoft's. Right. Like the default effect is so strong. It's powerful. That it made people hate a paperclip. It's true. But why Clippy specifically? Like, what was it about him that everyone hated so much? Okay. But if everyone hated Clippy so much, why is he back? Did Microsoft, like, forget why they sent him to live on that digital farm upstate? Well, I mean, they definitely tried to give him, like, a proper retirement. Okay. How so? You remember those old Windows XP commercials? Yeah. Where they, like, threw Clippy a going away party? I don't think I remember that. Oh, man. They had that whole thing with the guy in the Clippy costume. And he tilted with rubber bands. It was brutal. Oh, yeah. Like, they were trying to publicly exercise him. Totally. But, you know, that's when he kind of took on a life of his own. Really? Yeah. It's like that band that's more popular after they break up. Right, right. Suddenly he was a meme, a pop culture icon. Yeah. He really was everywhere for a while there. Everywhere. The Office, Silicon Valley. Oh, and don't forget that Twitter campaign a few years back. Oh, yeah. Where they were like, hey, if this gets 20,000 likes, we'll bring Clippy back as an emoji. And, of course... The internet went crazy. The internet was like, yes, bring him back. They blew past that goal. Crushed it. And now we've got Clippy emojis. We've got Clippy Teams backgrounds. Clippy's even in Halo now. He's back, baby. So is it just nostalgia? That's a good question. What? Like, why is everyone so obsessed with bringing back this paperclip? I mean, nostalgia is a part of it, for sure. Yeah. We love to, like, romanticize even our most frustrating tech. Right. Like, oh, remember when... Like, it's like that old dial-up modem sound. Oh, the worst. It was the worst. But now it's like, oh, that sound takes me back. Yeah, it does. Simpler times. Right. So are we saying that Clippy is our dial-up tone? Maybe. I mean, in a way, he does represent a simpler time, digitally speaking, at least, right? Okay. Like, think about it. It was before algorithms were, you know, tracking your every move, before you got bombarded with, like, personalized ads everywhere you went online. True, true. You know, so there's something kind of comforting about that. Even if, at the time, it didn't always feel that way. So Clippy, he's born out of this desire to make tech more human. Right. Everyone hates him for being too intrusive, too personal. Right. And now he's back as, like, a symbol of the good old days of the internet. The good old days. Wild. What a strange journey for a little paperclip. I know, right? It really makes you think. If Clippy can make a comeback, what else from, you know, early internet culture might be waiting in the wings for its time to shine again? And what will their return say about us? Hmm. Something to think about. Thanks for joining us on this deep dive into the very strange life and afterlife of Clippy.
