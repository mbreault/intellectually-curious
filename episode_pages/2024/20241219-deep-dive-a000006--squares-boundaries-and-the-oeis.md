## Description

We explore A000006 from the OEIS, decoding the quadratic form 4x^2 + 4xy + 5y^2. Using Bert Dobbeler's completing-the-square trick to rewrite it as (2x + y)^2 + 4y^2, we count how many integers are representable up to 2^n, illustrated with n = 4. Along the way we glimpse geometry, number theory, and the collaborative spirit that powers the OEIS.

## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. Yeah. You know, we're continuing our exploration of the OEIS. Right. The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Absolutely. Where we kind of dig into the fascinating math stories hidden within these sequences of numbers. For sure. And today's star sequence is A000006. Nice. And this one kind of takes us on a journey through squares and a little bit of geometric thinking. Yeah, it's really interesting how this one kind of comes back to that. We're looking at integers and how they relate to each other in these patterns. Right. And as always, the OEIS is like a giant dictionary. Yeah. But instead of words, we have these sequences. Each one has its own unique ID. Right. Like A000006. Right. And a description of the pattern it follows. Yeah, and today's sequence is defined as number of integers less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of n of the form 4x squared plus 4 by psi plus 5y squared. Right, and it might look a little intimidating at first. It does. But we're going to break it down and you'll see it's actually pretty intuitive. Okay, yeah, I'm already seeing x and y. Yeah. So those are our variables. Exactly. They represent integers, which means they can be any positive or negative whole number, including zero. Okay. So we're going to be plugging in different integers for x and y into that formula, and it's going to turn out a number for us. Okay, so we're going to play with those a little bit. Yeah, but there's a catch. Oh. We're only interested in numbers less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of n. Oh. So that's where our boundary comes in. I see, so for each n, we're essentially working within a doubling sequence, like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on. Exactly. And we're figuring out how many numbers generated by our formula fall within that particular stage's limit. Precisely. Okay. Now, if you look at the comments section, a contributor named Bert Dobbeler, he offered a neat trick. Okay. He suggests rewriting the expression as 2x plus y squared plus 4y squared. Okay. And this helps simplify things a bit. So is this always the best way to calculate, or are there instances where the original form might be easier? Well, it kind of depends. You know, sometimes it depends on your preference. Okay. The specific values of x and y, but generally Bert's method, it gets rid of that spicy term. Okay. And it just makes calculations a little smoother. Okay. And it's based on a come up called completing the square. Right, completing the square. I vaguely remember that from Algebra class. Yeah. Something about parabolas and finding their vertex. You got it. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're absolutely right. Completing the square does have a visual interpretation. Okay. Related to squares, and it even ties back to the Pythagorean theorem. Wow. And it kind of highlights the connection between number theory and geometry. Yeah, you wouldn't think that a formula about squares would relate to counting integers, but there it is. Right. It's remarkable how these seemingly disparate mathematical concepts, they intertwine. Absolutely. So are you ready to put our knowledge to the test? I think so. Let's take n equals 4. All right, so our upper limit is 2 to the power of 4. Right. Which is 16. Uh-huh. We need to find all the integers less than or equal to 16 that can be generated by our formula. Okay. Using Bert's simplified form. All right, let's start by plugging in x as 1 and y as 0 into 2x plus y squared plus 4y squared. Okay. And if we simplify that, we get 4. Right. Which is within our boundary. Okay, we got our first number. What happens when we keep x as 1 but change y to 1? Okay, so that gives us 2 times 1 plus 1 squared plus 4 times 1 squared, which equals 13. Okay. Still within our limit. Nice. Let's try another one. What about x is 0 and y is 1? Okay, plugging those values into the formula, we get 5. Okay. And so far, all our results are within our boundary of 16. And we can't forget about the case where x is 2 and y is 0. Right, because that gives us 16. Yes. Okay, so we found four numbers. Okay. 4, 5, 13, and 16. And guess what? What? The OEIS entry confirms that a 4 is indeed 4. Nice. It's like we cracked a code. We did. We took this complex formula, broke it down, applied some tricks, and found the specific numbers that fit the pattern. It's really cool to see it all come together. Yeah. And to make it even more clear, the OEIS entry states a 4 equals 4 since 2 to the power of 4 is 16, and 4, 5, 13, and 16 fit the criteria. This is fascinating. We've only scratched the surface of A00006. Right. And it already highlights the beauty of exploring the OEIS. Yeah, it's amazing how much depth there is to these sequences, even the ones that seem simple at first glance. Yeah, and it just makes you want to keep digging deeper. Absolutely. And see what other secrets we can uncover. Definitely. Yeah, it really makes you appreciate just how interconnected different areas of mathematics can be. Like we started with a sequence, and now we're talking about algebra and geometry and number theory all kind of woven together. It's like a mathematical tapestry. Right. With each thread representing a different concept. Exactly. And ultimately creating something intricate and beautiful. Absolutely. You mentioned a contributor named Bert Dobolari. Is anything known about him? You know, that's a good question. Yeah. I haven't personally looked into his contributions beyond this sequence, but I think it'd be fascinating to delve deeper into the people behind these mathematical discoveries. The OEIS wouldn't exist without the passion and contributions of individuals like him. Right. It speaks to the collaborative nature of the OEIS. It does. It's like this global community of math enthusiasts working together to kind of unlock the secrets of these sequences. Absolutely. Speaking of secrets, I'm curious about the practical implications of A00076. Does it have any real-world applications beyond pure mathematics? While A00076 itself might not have direct applications in fields like engineering or physics, the concepts it explores are fundamental to many areas of STEM. Okay. For example, quadratic forms, like the one we've been working with. Yeah. They pop up in optimization problems, signal processing, and even cryptography. Yeah. So even though this specific sequence might not be building bridges, the mathematical ideas it embodies are essential building blocks for many practical applications. So it's like the foundation. Exactly. That's pretty cool. It's a reminder that abstract mathematical concepts often have far-reaching consequences in the real world. Right. Like think about the idea of counting numbers that fit a certain pattern within specific boundaries. Okay. Like that's used all the time. Yeah. Especially in algorithms and computer science. Right. They often involve sifting through data sets and processing elements that meet specific criteria. Yeah. That concept of counting and filtering within boundaries is crucial. Right. It's amazing how something that seems purely theoretical can have such practical relevance. Absolutely. It really shows the power of mathematics as a tool for understanding and navigating the world around us. For sure. Now going back to A00076, one thing that particularly fascinates me is its connection to geometric representations. Right. We briefly mentioned the visual aspect of completing the square. Right. I wonder if there are other ways to visualize or represent the sequence. Perhaps using geometric shapes or by identifying patterns within the numbers themselves. That's a fascinating question. Right. It's like a challenge to kind of explore the sequence further. Yeah. And see if we can unearth any hidden visual connections. Exactly. Who knows? Maybe someone listening will discover a whole new way to understand A00076 and contribute their findings back to the OEIS. Right. Adding another layer to this ever-evolving mathematical tapestry. Right. And that's what's so exciting about the OEIS is it's a living, breathing resource. It is. Constantly being enriched by the contributions of this global community. Absolutely. And it really democratizes access to mathematics. It does. Anyone with an internet connection can explore this fascinating world of numbers. Exactly. It's like a treasure hunt. You never know what gems you'll uncover as you navigate through the sequences. I remember feeling a bit intimidated by the OEIS the first time I stumbled upon it. Oh, yeah. All those numbers and formulas. But once I started clicking around and reading the entries, I was hooked. It's that initial curiosity that often leads to the most rewarding discoveries. Right. Yeah. Well, this has been an incredible journey into the world of A00076. It has. From a seemingly daunting formula to a fascinating exploration of squares and boundaries and collaborative discovery. Right. This sequence has showcased the beauty and the depth of mathematics. Absolutely. And it's just a taste of what the OEIS has to offer. Right. With hundreds of thousands of sequences waiting to be explored, the possibilities for mathematical exploration are endless. And the best part is it's constantly growing and evolving. It is. New sequences are being added all the time. Researchers are constantly finding new connections and applications. Yeah. So to our listeners who might be new to the OEIS, don't be intimidated by the initial complexity. Dive in and explore. You might be surprised by what you discover. Absolutely.
