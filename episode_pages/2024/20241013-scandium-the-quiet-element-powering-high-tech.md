## Transcript

All right, ready to dive in today? We're tackling scandium. Yes, scandium. It's not the most well-known element. Definitely one of the quieter ones on the periodic table. But I have a feeling it's got a story to tell. Oh, absolutely. And it's a story that actually begins before it was even discovered. Wait, what? How can something have a story before it's discovered? Well, think about it. Someone predicted its existence, right? I mean, like, they knew it was out there, just hadn't, like, actually found it yet. Exactly. And that's where Dmitri Mendeleev comes in, the father of the periodic table. He was organizing elements, but he realized there were gaps. Like missing puzzle pieces. Yeah, and he was so sharp, he predicted not just the existence of these missing elements, but also their properties. Yeah, he predicted the atomic weight. Yeah. Even things like what its oxide would be like. And one of those predicted elements. That was our friend scandium. Wow. So before anyone had even seen scandium, they had a pretty good idea of what to expect. Precisely. And then, fast forward to 1879. A Swedish chemist, Lars Frederick Nilsson. He was analyzing some pretty complex minerals. Kinda minerals. Things like euksonite, gadolinite. Definitely not your everyday rocks. Sounds like serious chemistry stuff. Oh, for sure. Yep. And it was within those intricate minerals that Nilsson found it, scandium. I bet that was a huge moment. They finally put a face to the name, so to speak. Oh, definitely. It was a big win for Mendeleev's predictions, too. Remember, he predicted this stuff years earlier. Talk about validation. So they find this predicted element, and wouldn't you know it, it's hanging out in Scandinavia. Seems fitting. Right. It's like it was meant to be. But here's where things get interesting. It's more abundant in stars than it is in the Earth's crust. Hold on, wait, what? It's more common in stars. But we're on Earth, a planet, you know, made from stardust. Shouldn't it be everywhere? It's all about distribution, you see. It's not that Earth lacks scandium, it's just spread out super thin. Ah, okay, so it's playing hard to get. Exactly. Instead of those nice concentrated deposits we see with some other elements, scandium likes to keep us guessing. So those concentrated sources, those are what we're really looking for then. What would those be? So you've got things like thorvaitite that one can have a crazy amount of scandium oxide, like 45%. 45%? That's a whole lot of scandium. Are there others? And then there's gadolinite. Beautiful mineral, popular with collectors and obviously important for scandium's discovery. All right, so we've got scandium from the stars, predicted before it was found, hiding out in these rare minerals. What else? What's it actually like? Well, let me tell you, scandium is a bit of a character. It's got some quirks, especially when it comes to its properties. Quirks? Like what? Spill the tea. For one thing, it's got this weird resistance to a specific mix of acids, nitric and hydrofluoric. Most metals, they wouldn't stand a chance. But not scandium. Nope, scandium just shrugs it off. Oh, and it's got a bit of a flair for the dramatic, too. Oh, tell me more. When it burns in the air, it creates this brilliant, almost impossibly yellow flame. No way. It's true. That's actually the formation of scandium oxide, by the way. Of course. From stars to flames, it's scandium all the way down. But are there any dangerous reactions we should know about? Hmm, well, let's just say scandium knows how to put on a show. But speaking of reactions, there's this one quirk that really has chemists scratching their heads. It involves hydrogen. Hydrogen? Like the simplest element there is. You'd think it'd be straightforward, right? So scandium forms a hydride, which is a compound with hydrogen. But instead of forming what you might expect, scandium goes its own way. And what will we expect? You'd expect it to form SCH3, right? Three hydrogens. Makes sense to me. Right. But scandium, it goes for SCH2, two hydrogens. We still don't fully understand why. So even the simplest element, hydrogen, can't pin scandium down, huh? Nope. It's a mystery wrapped in an enigma, this scandium. Always keeping us on our toes. It's like it's got this secret life, this element from the stars hiding out, breaking the rules. But with all that being said, does scandium actually do anything? Like, in the real world? You bet it does. And that's where it really shines. Scandium's got this unexpected versatility, pops up in all sorts of places. Okay, you've got to give me some examples here. What kind of applications are we talking about? Okay, so you know aluminum, right? One of the most common metals, used for everything. Sure, aluminum. I know aluminum. Now, what if you could take aluminum, and just by adding a tiny bit of something special, you could make it way stronger, more heat resistant? Sounds like something out of a science fiction movie. What's the secret ingredient? Scandium. It's amazing, you don't even need a lot. Less than half a percent even can make a huge difference. Seriously, less than 1%. And it changes the whole game. That's the thing about scandium. It's a team player, but it doesn't need to be the star of the show to make an impact. When you add it to aluminum, it forms these teeny, super strong crystals. Al3Sc, if you want to get technical. Al3Sc, got it. And those crystals, they act like microscopic reinforcements, makes the aluminum way more robust. Okay, so it's like instead of a regular aluminum baseball bat, you've got one with like hidden armor inside. Exactly, and those high-performance bats, they often use scandium. Lacrosse sticks, too. Anything that needs to withstand impact, you know. Makes sense. So if I'm holding one of these super strong baseball bats, am I holding a bit of scandium? You got it. And it's not just sports equipment. Scandium also makes aluminum easier to weld, so lightweight bicycle frames, for example. Wait, so like my bike could have scandium in it? It's possible. And it goes even further. They've used scandium aluminum alloys in some pretty demanding applications. Demanding? Like, don't leave me hanging. Think parts for fighter jets. Fighter jets? You're kidding. Nope. Russian MiG fighter jets, even. Scandium is on a whole other level. See, this element's got range. Wait till you hear this. Scandium also has a thing for light. Light? Now that's a curveball. What's the connection there? Okay, imagine you're a filmmaker, right? Yeah. And you need to shoot a scene at night, but you want that moonlit look. Okay, I'm picturing it. So you could use these special lamps, mercury vapor lamps. They're super powerful. Yeah, I've seen those. Super bright, kind of harsh light. Right. But here's the thing. If you add scandium iodide... Hold up. Scandium iodide? Yeah, so scandium and iodide. Add a bit of that to the mix. Those lamps become amazing at mimicking natural sunlight. Whoa, so even though it's artificial light, it looks like the real deal. Exactly. And that's huge in filming, in sports lighting, all sorts of things. So scandium is like Hollywood's best kept secret, bringing those nighttime scenes to life? That's one way to put it. But believe it or not, the surprises don't stop there. Scandium. It's even used in dentistry. Dentistry? We're jumping from fighter jets to the dentist's chair now. I'm telling you, scandium gets around. So they have these specialized lasers for certain dental procedures, getting cavities ready for fillings, root canals, things like that. Okay. And guess what? Those lasers, scandium's a key component. This is too much. Scandium is like the ultimate multitasker. I never would have guessed. And remember we were talking about it being a bit hard to find, those concentrated sources? Well, it turns out they're finding scandium in a pretty unexpected place. Let me guess. Volcanoes. Under the ocean. Oil refineries. Oil refineries. Now that's a plot twist I didn't see coming. I use a special kind of scandium there. Scandium-46. It's radioactive. Hold on. Radioactive scandium? Are you serious? Yeah. But don't worry, it's totally safe. They use tiny controlled amounts. Okay, good to know. But why use it at all? What's so special about radioactive scandium? Well, with scandium-46, they can monitor the flow of liquids in the refinery, even detect leaks in those huge pipelines. Huh. So it's like a safety net, keeping those big operations running smoothly. Exactly. Scandium. Yeah. A tiny element, keeping those massive oil refineries in check. Who would have thought? This is wild. Fighter jets, dentist's offices, oil refineries. Is there anything scandium can't do? Well, it might not be able to do your taxes, but it's definitely got potential. And one of the most exciting areas of research right now, clean energy. Clean energy. Now that's something I want to hear more about. How does scandium fit into that? Have you
