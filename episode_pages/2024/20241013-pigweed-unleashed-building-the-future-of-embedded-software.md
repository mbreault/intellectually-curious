## Transcript

All right, ready to dive into this Pigweed thing? It's everywhere I turn in the embedded world these days. Yeah, it's really blowing up, and not just hype either. There's actual real-world stuff happening with it. Okay, color me intrigued. But back up a sec. What is Pigweed, for people who haven't bumped into it yet? So, at its core, Pigweed is a bunch of libraries, modules they call them, aimed at building software for all those tiny computers we're suddenly surrounded by. Right, not just laptops and phones anymore. The whole Internet of Things shebang needs brains, right? Exactly. But here's the catch. Building for those resource-limited gizmos? It's tough age. That's where Pigweed jumps in. It's supposed to make this whole embedded development process faster, more reliable, even enjoyable, they claim. Especially when you've got a whole team involved. Bringing the big software development guns to the tiny computer fight, huh? I've heard some horror stories about embedded development, so I can see the appeal. Oh, you have no idea. Yeah. The worst part is, you might think, well, this is Google we're talking about. It's probably for their fancy stuff. But it's not just for them, even though they are using it in things like Pixel phones and Nest thermostats. No way, seriously. Their big products are using this already. Okay, that's a pretty strong vote of confidence. For sure. But the cool part is, they designed it to be helpful for anyone using these common microcontrollers like, say, STM32 or the NRF52, which are everywhere. So whether you're some tech giant or just tinkering in your basement, it's trying to level the playing field. I like that. But you said there's big news. Something about a new Pigweed SDK and Raspberry Pi. Don't leave me hanging. Right. They just dropped a developer preview of this SDK, and it's meant to make using Pigweed even smoother. Prototyping, debugging, testing, the whole nine yards. Music to a developer's ears. But for the uninitiated, break down. What does that actually mean for someone using it? Imagine this. You're building, I don't know, a smart coffee maker, right? With this SDK, you can get your prototype up and running crazy fast, test it like crazy. And when you're finally ready to ship it, you've got more confidence that it's solid. And big point here, it's really aiming at C++ development, which, let's be real, is huge in embedded systems for that performance and control. Right. C++ being the go-to for when every millisecond counts. So this is a big chunk of embedded developers who benefit. But you also mentioned Raspberry Pi support. What's the deal there? Now, this is where it gets interesting. They've officially announced support for the Raspberry Pi Pico 2. Specifically, it's RP2350 microcontroller. That's a huge signal, because now Pigweed's part of this crazy popular and well-supported ecosystem, opening it up to a way wider audience. Raspberry Pi, they're everywhere. So this isn't just some theoretical support. It's saying Pigweed's ready for prime time. Okay, we've got the what and the why and the holy cow Raspberry Pi. But let's peek under the hood a bit. What's in this SDK that makes it special? One word, Basil. Basil. Okay, I've heard the name, but remind me, why is it a big deal? It's a build system, but for a lot of embedded folks, it's going to be a whole different beast than what they're used to. Think of it as the conductor for your whole software building process, especially for big, messy projects where the usual tools start choking. I can already sense a but coming here. There's always a trade-off, right? You know it. But Basil, it's built to be fast, reliable, and it can handle those massive projects with tons of dependencies, which, let's face it, embedded systems have a lot of. So tackling those compile times and dependency hell head-on. Okay, I'm starting to get it. And get this, the Pigweed team actually helped write a Basil-based build system for the Pico SDK itself. They're not just talking the talk, they're walking the walk, making the whole ecosystem better. No, that's commitment. What else is under the hood that's got people excited? Well, Pigweed's also all in on the Clang LLVM toolchain. Okay, confession time. That one sounds a bit intimidating. Can you break it down? Totally. Basically, it's a set of modern, powerful tools for your code. Clang's a compiler famous for its crazy helpful error messages, which any developer will tell you is a godsend, while LLVM is the engine behind it all. So trading in your rusty old toolbox for a shiny, high-tech upgrade. Exactly. But it's more than just looking cool. Using Clang LLVM also helps make sure your code follows the rules, which makes developers happy because it means fewer headaches down the road and your code's more likely to work on different systems. Standards compliance, I can see the appeal. But even with the best tools, embedded can feel a bit bare-bones. What about working in an environment where you've got more support? You hit the nail on the head, and this is where they knocked it out of the park. They integrated with VS Code. VS Code, the code editor that's practically taken over the world. The one and only. And not just some half-baked thing either. This is the real deal with full code intelligence. You got your auto-completion, debugging tools, the whole shebang. Okay, that is a game-changer. Coming from traditional embedded tools, being able to work in VS Code is a breath of fresh air. Right, it's like bringing embedded into the 21st century, you know? But here's the thing, and this is key to understanding Pigweed. It's not just the tools, it's the whole philosophy behind it all. Ooh, intriguing. The Pigweed philosophy. It's like ancient wisdom for building tiny computers. Tell me more. What's the big picture here? So we're back, and you left me hanging with this whole Pigweed philosophy thing. Sounds like there's more to this than meets the eye. Oh, absolutely. Pigweed isn't just some random toolkit thrown together. It's built on this idea of sustainability, robustness, making life easier for the team, especially if things get complex. Not just getting it done, but getting it done right in a way that won't fall apart when you've got a whole team messing with the code. Exactly. And you can see this in how much they focus on testing. They even built this tool, Pico Pico, just for running tests on a bunch of devices at the same time. Wait, they made a whole testing tool just for Pigweed? Now that's dedication. Most people would just use what's already out there. And get this, they built it in a week. Shows you how serious they are about robust code right from the start. Embedded systems, especially in critical stuff, a tiny bug can mean big trouble. Oh, we. Okay, that's impressive. Guess when you're passionate about something, you can move mountains. But we've been talking a lot about this RP2350 microcontroller. Is Pigweed stuck on that one chip? Good question. The RP2350 is a great showcase, but here's the thing. Most Pigweed modules, they're designed to be hardware agnostic. Meaning it's not tied to just one chip. You can use it on a whole bunch of different hardware. That's huge if you're working across different platforms. Exactly. They're thinking big picture build tools that are versatile, adaptable, not just a band-aid for one specific problem. Love that. Build it once, use it everywhere. Okay, but with all this SDK talk, what about the rest of Pigweed? Any hidden gems we should know about? Oh, tons. One that comes to mind is PO Console, their tool for talking to devices. But it's not just your average command line thing. Now you've got my attention. What makes it so special? Some kind of super-powered terminal? You could say that. They designed it for both development and e-manufacturing, the whole shebang. Same tools, same workflow, from the first prototype to when you're churning them out by the thousands. That's slick. Having great tools for writing code is one thing, but having that carry over to the factory floor, that's next level. So with all this awesomeness already here, what's next? What are they cooking up? Well, based on their blog and some talks they've given, there's juicy stuff in the works. Big one is a whole new communication stack, making it way easier to connect devices, build those robust networks. New comm stack? That's huge. Networking is so crucial for embedded stuff these days. Anything that makes it smoother is a win. Anything else got you excited? Factory scripting tools. Remember how we talked about Paycom Console working for both dev and manufacturing? These new tools, they're going to take that to a whole new level, automate even more of the process. Wow, they're going all in on this ecosystem. This isn't just a set of tools anymore. It's a whole platform for developing, testing, even manufacturing these systems. You got it. And here's the cherry on top. They've got a killer community, super active and passionate. Music to my ears. A good community can make or break an open source project. What makes Pigweed stand out? For one, their Discord is popping. Developers asking questions, sharing projects, getting help straight from the Pigweed team. Plus, they do these monthly online meetups open to everyone. Love to hear that. It's not just about throwing code over the wall. They're actually listening to the people who use it. Totally. They seem to get that community is key if you want an open source project to thrive. So as we're diving deep into this Pigweed world, what's
