## Description

In this episode, we dive into Gencastâ€”the diffusion-model weather predictor from Google DeepMind trained on 40 years of ERA5 data. We'll explain how it generates ensembles (not images), outperforms current systems up to 15 days, and forecasts extremes like heat waves and cyclones. Plus, the code and weights are open source, lowering barriers for researchers worldwide and speeding up innovation in meteorology and climate resilience.

## Transcript

All right, so we're diving into some pretty wild stuff today. Remember all that hype about AI making art? Well, it turns out the tech behind it. Yeah, those diffusion models. Exactly, those diffusion models are being used to predict the weather now. Whoa, really? Yeah, no fancy satellite pictures or anything, just pure number crunching. Kind of shaking things up in meteorology. Yeah, I bet that's pretty unexpected. Definitely. So what's the name of this weather model? It's called Gencast. Gencast. Yeah, it was developed by Google DeepMind. Okay. And it's really turning heads because it's outperforming some of the most sophisticated forecasting systems we have. Really? Yeah, even predicting like extreme events with crazy accuracy. Okay, I am intrigued. So how does it actually work? I get the image thing, you know, adding the noise and reversing it. But this is weather we're talking about, not making pictures. Exactly, and that's what's so interesting about it. Gencast doesn't use images at all. What? Nope, instead it's trained on this massive data set. It's called the ECMWF ERA5 archive. The ECMWF what now? ECMWF ERA5 archive. It's basically this gigantic record of the Earth's weather going back like 40 years. 40 years? Yeah, like measurements of temperature, wind speed, pressure, all that stuff. So it's like Gencast is reading a 40-year-long weather journal for the whole planet. That's a great way to put it. And just like those diffusion models learn to make images from noise, Gencast has learned to recognize these intricate patterns and relationships in all those numbers. Okay, so it's looking for patterns in decades of weather data. But how does that actually become like a weather forecast? Well, instead of like recreating an image, it generates sequences of numbers that represent future weather scenarios. Okay. And here's the really cool part. Yeah. It doesn't just give you a single prediction. It produces what are called ensemble. Ensemble, so it's like hedging its bets, giving us a range of possibilities. Exactly, it's acknowledging that weather is inherently uncertain. So instead of saying it'll be 25 degrees tomorrow, it'll say there's a 60% chance of temperatures between 23 and 27 degrees. Well, that makes a lot more sense. It's like when a weather forecaster says there's a chance of rain rather than it will definitely rain. Right. So how do those Gencast ensembles stack up against the old school forecasting methods? Well, it's not just an improvement, it's a major leap forward. When you compare it to the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, ENS. That's a mouthful. Yeah, ECMWF ENS, which is like the leading forecasting system right now. Okay. Gencast actually outperforms it on most predictions up to 15 days out. 15 days, that's impressive. Most forecasts I see get really iffy after a week. And here's where it gets even cooler. Okay. Gencast is really good at forecasting extreme weather. Really? Like heat waves, high winds, even the paths of tropical cyclones like hurricanes and typhoons. Hold on, more accurate hurricane predictions. Yeah. That would be huge for coastal communities. Absolutely. And think about what that means for other things too, like agriculture, aviation, renewable energy. Better forecasts mean better planning, which leads to more safety, better efficiency in resource management. And all of this from a model that doesn't even look at pictures. It's pretty remarkable, right? It shows that sometimes the best solutions come from looking at things from a completely different angle. I'm starting to see why people are excited about this. But how practical is it? I mean, the old way of forecasting uses these massive supercomputers running for hours. Right. What kind of computer does Gencast need? Well, that's another area where Gencast shines. It can generate a 15-day forecast in just eight minutes. And it all runs on a single Google Cloud TPU V5. Wait, hold on. What's a TPU V5? Oh, right. TPU stands for Tensor Processing Unit. It's a special piece of hardware Google made specifically for machine learning. Okay. The V5 is the fifth generation of that technology. And it's super powerful and efficient. So not your average computer? Definitely not. These TPUs are designed to handle the crazy calculations involved in training and running these massive AI models like Gencast. So we've got this incredibly accurate and efficient AI model running on specialized hardware. Sounds like a pretty big accomplishment. What's next for Gencast? What's Google DeepMind doing with this technology? Well, this is where it gets really exciting. They've decided to make Gencast's code and weights public. Wait, they're making it open source? Yeah. That's huge. What does that mean for the scientific community? It means that researchers everywhere now have access to this cutting-edge technology. They can study how it works, experiment with it, and even use it to build even more advanced forecasting models. Wow. So instead of keeping it a secret, they're giving it to the world. Yep. It shows how committed they are to open science and the idea that collaboration is key to unlocking AI's potential to help humanity. This is blowing my mind. I mean, who would have thought that the same tech used to make those AI images could also predict the weather so accurately? It really shows how different fields can come together and inspire each other. And the fact that it's open source, that changes everything. It opens up so many possibilities for future research and development. So what kind of possibilities are we talking about? What could happen now that researchers around the world have this technology? Well, for one other, research groups can now take Gencast and train it on different datasets, maybe focusing on specific regions or types of weather. So we could have models for predicting monsoons in India or blizzards in the Northeast? Exactly. And since Gencast is so efficient, researchers could even run it on less powerful computers, making it more accessible to more scientists around the world. That's a great point. Giving more people access to these tools could really speed up progress on a global scale. Absolutely. And it's not just about focusing on different places. Remember how we talked about Gencast creating those ensembles of possible weather scenarios? Yes, the hedging its bets approach? Right. Well, there's a lot of room for improvement in how we interpret and communicate those ensembles to the people who need to make decisions. So it's not just about making the predictions better, but also making them more understandable and useful? Exactly. Imagine a tool that could visualize those different weather scenarios, showing the possible effects on a region or a system. Yeah, that would be amazing for things like disaster preparedness, urban planning, even resource management. Yeah. It's not just about knowing a hurricane might hit. It's about understanding what could happen and preparing for it. Precisely. And we're just scratching the surface here. The open source release of Gencast could lead to a whole bunch of new innovations in weather forecasting and climate science impacting countless other fields. It's like we've been given this powerful new way to understand the weather, and with it, the ability to predict and prepare for the future like never before. It's a powerful reminder that we live in an age of incredible technology, and when AI is used thoughtfully and ethically, it has the potential to solve some of our biggest challenges. This is a lot to take in. We've covered a lot in a short amount of time. But before we finish part one of our deep dive into Gencast and these amazing diffusion models, there's one question I want to ask you. Okay, I'm listening. We keep talking about these weights that are released with the code. What do they actually look like? Is it like a massive spreadsheet of numbers? That's a great question. It really gets to the core of how these models learn and make predictions. Yeah, you're right. They are a huge collection of numbers, but they're not just random. Oh, okay. They're organized in a very specific way that basically defines the structure and the function of the model. Okay. Think of it like a complex network, like a brain, with all these interconnected nodes. Okay. Each connection between those nodes has a weight assigned to it that represents how strong that connection is. So instead of just a jumbled mess of numbers, it's more like a highly organized network where each weight has a specific job. Exactly. And those weights are constantly being adjusted during the training process as the model learns from all that data. Oh, yeah. It's kind of like fine-tuning a musical instrument. Okay. You adjust the tension of each string until it sounds just right. So when they release the weights, they're sharing that tuned version of GenCast, all the knowledge it's gained from analyzing all that weather data. Exactly. That's why it's so valuable to other researchers. Yeah. They can take those weights and use them as a starting point for their own experiments without having to go through the hassle of training the model from scratch. It's like giving someone a head start in a race. Exactly. They don't have to train for months to reach the starting line. They can just jump in and start running. Perfect analogy. Yeah. And because it's open source, any improvements or discoveries made using those weights can be shared back with the community. Oh, it sucks. So it speeds up progress even more. This whole collaborative thing with open science is really powerful. It really is. It creates this environment of shared learning and really accelerates discoveries, especially in a field as complex and important as weather forecasting. Yeah, for sure. The more people working on these problems, the better prepared we'll be to understand and adapt to climate change. It's like we've all been given this powerful new tool. Right. And now we're all working together to figure out the best way to use it. That's a great way to think
