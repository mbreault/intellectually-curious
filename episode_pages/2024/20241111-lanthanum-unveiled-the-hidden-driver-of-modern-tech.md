## Transcript

Welcome to another deep dive, everyone. This time, we're taking a closer look at lanthanum. Lanthanum? Yeah, lanthanum. It's more common than lead. Hmm, that's pretty interesting. Yeah. And we'll be uncovering its journey, you know, from being this hidden element to becoming a key player in all this modern technology that we have today. Okay. We've got some really cool sources for this, too. We've got scientific articles, chemical databases, even a podcast episode. Yeah. All dedicated to lanthanum. Wow. A whole podcast episode. Someone must have thought it was pretty interesting. Right. So are you ready to dive in and discover some of lanthanum's secrets? Yeah, let's do it. I'm always up for a good element deep dive. Where should we start? Well, I guess the first thing we should do is try to figure out just what lanthanum is, right? Okay, yeah. So lanthanum is a silvery-white metal. Okay. And it has the atomic number 57. 57, okay. And it's part of the lanthanide series. Right. You know, those elements that are kind of tucked away down there at the bottom of the periodic table on that separate little row. Yeah, yeah. The lanthanides, they always seemed a little mysterious to me down there. They are pretty fascinating. So what's lanthanum like? Like if I could hold it in my hand, what would it feel like? Okay, so picture this. You've got lanthanum in your hand, and it's so soft that you can actually cut it with a knife. Whoa, really? Yeah, it's really reactive, and that's because it has a large atomic radius. Actually, the largest among all the other lanthanides. So it's, like, super reactive but also super soft? That's kind of cool. Yeah. And it's a little bit of an oddball, too, in the lanthanide family because of how its electrons are arranged. Okay. What do you mean by that? Well, most of the lanthanides, they have electrons in their 4F subshells. But lanthanum, it usually doesn't, at least not in its ground state. It's kind of unique that way. So what's the big deal with these 4F electrons? What do they actually do? Well, you could think of it this way. The 4F subshells, they're like these inner rooms inside the atom where the electrons can hang out. And a lot of the lanthanides have electrons in these rooms, and that gives them, like, you know, unique properties. Like what? Oh, things like magnetic properties. Right. Optical properties, all kinds of cool stuff. But lanthanum, it keeps those rooms empty in its ground state. So it's just like, nope, not going to use those rooms right now. Pretty much. But here's the thing. Those 4F electrons, they can jump into action when lanthanum needs to form chemical bonds. And that gives it some pretty interesting characteristics. Interesting. So it's like it has a secret weapon it can pull out when it needs to. I like that. Speaking of secrets, how did anyone even discover lanthanum in the first place? Oh, it's a classic science detective story. Okay, tell me more. I love a good mystery. So back in 1839, there was this Swedish chemist, Carl Gustav Mosander. Okay. And he was working with this stuff called cerium nitrate, and he stumbled upon something unusual. Unusual how? He eventually realized there was another element hiding inside the cerium, and that, my friend, was lanthanum. Whoa, so it's hiding in plain sight. That's amazing. It is, isn't it? And the name lanthanum, it comes from a Greek word, lanthanein, which means to lie hidden. Wow. So the name really fits, huh? Perfectly. And you know what? It took, like, almost a whole century to isolate pure lanthanum metal. Really? Why is that? Because it's so similar to cerium. Oh, I see. Yeah. Imagine trying to separate two substances that are basically twins. It was a real challenge. Yeah, I can imagine. So this element that basically played hide-and-seek for, like, 100 years is now a part of our everyday life. It is. Crazy, right? Yeah. So, like, what was lanthanum's first big break? Like, its first big use? Hmm. Well, ironically, its first application wasn't very successful. Really? What was it? They tried using it in gas lantern mantles. Gas lantern mantles. Yep. But it didn't really work out. Almost like it was destined for something bigger, you know? Yeah. Almost like it had to wait for its moment to shine. So speaking of bigger things, where does lanthanum fit in the modern world? Well, let's start with something you probably use every day. Okay. What's that? My car. My car. Yeah. Did you know that lanthanum actually plays a pretty important role in hybrid vehicles? Really? I had no idea. How does that work? Well, think about cars like the Toyota Prius. They run on these batteries. Yeah. Nickel-metal hydride batteries, right? Exactly. And those batteries rely on lanthanum alloys. Oh, wow. Okay. So how much lanthanum are we talking about here? Oh, each hybrid vehicle needs a decent amount. Something like 10 to 15 kilograms of lanthanum. Whoa. So my daily commute is partially powered by lanthanum. I had no idea. It is. And get this. As we're moving towards electric vehicles and battery technology is, like, constantly improving, the demand for lanthanum is going to skyrocket. It could even double. That's incredible. So we're talking about a hidden element that's, like, driving the future of transportation. What else can lanthanum do? Well, hold on your hat because we're about to get into the world of future energy. Lanthanum alloys are being researched for hydrogen storage. Wait, hydrogen storage? What do you mean? They can absorb and release huge amounts of hydrogen gas. Wow, that's amazing. So are you saying these alloys could change the way we use and store energy in the future? Exactly. Imagine having a safe and efficient way to store all that hydrogen. It could become a major player in renewable energy. Okay, that's seriously impressive. We've got lanthanum powering cars and potentially changing how we store energy. What other surprises does this element have up its sleeve? Get ready for this one. It has to do with something I'm sure you've used before. Okay, what is it? A cigarette lighter. A cigarette lighter? Yep. You know that spark you see? Yeah, of course. Well, that spark, it comes from mishmetal. Mishmetal. Yeah. It's an alloy, and guess what? It contains a significant amount of lanthanum. No way. So every time I use a lighter, I'm using lanthanum. That's crazy. I know, right? But we're just scratching the surface here. Really? There's more. Oh, yeah. Lanthanum is a key player in a lot of high-tech applications, too. Things you might not even realize. Okay, I'm all ears. Tell me more. We've got electron microscopes and spacecraft thrusters. Spacecraft thrusters? Those are pretty high tech. How does lanthanum even fit into all of that? They both use a special compound called lanthanum boride. Lanthanum boride. Okay. What's so special about it? Well, it's a ceramic, and it can withstand incredibly high temperatures. Wow. Plus, it's a fantastic conductor of electricity. So it's tough and conducts electricity well. I guess that makes sense for, like, you know, advanced technologies and stuff. Right, so like in electron microscopes, for example. Yeah? Lanthanum boride is used to create a really focused beam of electrons. Okay. And that allows scientists to magnify things that are, like, thousands of times smaller than a human hair. That's amazing. It is. And in spacecraft thrusters, lanthanum boride helps to ionize the propellant. Ionize the propellant? Yeah. It creates the thrust that allows the spacecraft to move around in space. Okay, so this one element is helping us explore, like, the microscopic world and the vastness of outer space. Exactly. Lanthanum really is a hidden hero, but I'm still curious about something. Oh, what's that? You mentioned that lanthanum is actually more common than lead in the Earth's crust. Yeah, it is. So why do we call it a rare earth element? That seems kind of contradictory. Yeah, the term rare earth can be a little misleading. Okay. Lanthanum and the other lanthanides, they're not actually that rare in terms of, like, how much of them exists. Right. The problem is getting them out of the ground. What do you mean? It's hard to extract them from the ores they're found in. So it's not about scarcity, but it's about difficulty. Exactly. You see, they tend to be found all together in these really complex mineral deposits. Oh. And trying to separate them. It's really complicated and expensive. So it's not like digging up gold nuggets. It's more like trying to untangle, like, a giant knot of different colored threads. That's a great analogy. Thanks. So even though there's a lot of lanthanum out there, it's still really valuable because it's not easy to get our hands on it in a usable form. Yeah, it's kind of like a hidden treasure. It is. So, okay, we've talked about how useful lanthanum is. But with all these amazing
