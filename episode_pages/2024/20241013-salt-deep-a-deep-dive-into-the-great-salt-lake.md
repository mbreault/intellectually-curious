## Description

Join us for a science-and-story plunge into Utahâ€™s Great Salt Lakeâ€”from its origins as Lake Bonneville to todayâ€™s hypersaline north arm, brine shrimp and flamingos, and the legends that surround it. We explore the lakeâ€™s ecology, the two-armed mismatch caused by the Lucent Cutoff, ongoing threats from shrinking waters and air quality, and the human stories that make this salty giant worth protecting.

## Transcript

All right, ready to dive in. Today we're going deep, and I mean deep into the Great Salt Lake. Deep dive is right. You know, it's funny. You hear Great Salt Lake and you think, okay, big, salty, what else is there? Right. Turns out a lot else. I've been looking over our source material excerpts from the Great Salt Lake Wikipedia page. Classic. And honestly, I'm blown away. This lake is like a history lesson, a science experiment, and a nature documentary all rolled into one. It really is something else. It's not every day you get to explore a place that makes the ocean look like a freshwater pond, salinity-wise. Yeah, that's one way to put it. But you're right. The salt is only the beginning. There's so much more to uncover. Ancient megalakes, unique ecosystems, even a flamingo named Pink Floyd. Okay, you have to tell me more about this flamingo later. But first, let's back up a bit. I mean, how does a lake even get to be that salty in the first place? It wasn't always like this, was it? You're on the right track. Our salty friend here actually started as something much, much bigger, Lake Bonneville. Imagine a lake so large, it'd make Lake Michigan look like a puddle. Seriously, that big. No joke. It covered most of Utah and parts of Idaho and Nevada. But then, around 16,800 years ago, boom, a massive flood triggered by a collapsing ice dam. Wow, talk about a bad day at the lake. You could say that. This flood was so powerful, it carved out Red Rock Pass in Idaho and shrunk Lake Bonneville down to, well, a fraction of its former glory. So the Great Salt Lake is like the after picture of this ancient megalake. Exactly. And because it has no outlet to the ocean, all those minerals, all that salt, it just keeps concentrating over time as water flows in and evaporates. Which explains why it's, what, like five times saltier than the ocean? Five to 27 times saltier, depending on the part of the lake. Imagine taking a dip in that. Oh, I've seen pictures, people bobbing around like corks. You'd practically be bouncing off the surface. Pretty much. You become incredibly buoyant. The salinity is so high, it's like swimming in a giant bowl of Epsom salt. And here I thought the Dead Sea was impressive. Oh, the Great Salt Lake can definitely hold its own in the salinity department. We're talking millions of tons of minerals deposited each year, thanks to rivers like the Bear, Weber, and Jordan all emptying into it. Okay, hold on, rewind. Millions of tons of minerals, super salty, practically impossible to sink in. But there are still things living in this lake, right? Oh, absolutely. In fact, it's teeming with life, just not the kind you typically find in your average lake. That's where things get really interesting. You know, when you think Salt Lake, you don't usually picture islands and causeways, right? It's like this unexpected twist. You're not wrong there. Yeah. That causeway, the Lucent Cutoff, it's a story in itself. Built back in the 50s, and it was a big deal for transportation. But like a lot of things, it came with some unintended consequences. Unintended consequences. Okay, now I'm really curious. Did they accidentally create a brine shrimp traffic jam or something? Not quite, but you're thinking along the right lines. The causeway essentially cut the lake in two, creating the North and South Arms. And because of that, things got kind of uneven. Uneven how? Like one side got all the good restaurants? More like one side got all the salt. Remember how we talked about the Great Salt Lake's crazy salinity? Yeah, it makes the ocean look like distilled water. Right. Well, with the causeway in place, the North Arm, which doesn't have any major rivers flowing into it, it basically turned into this hypersaline environment. Even saltier than the already super salty South Arms. So like brine shrimp retirement home on one side, and the wild, untamed salt flats on the other. Something like that. That hypersaline North Arm, it's not exactly hospitable to most life forms. We're talking algae, bacteria, the real extremophiles. They're the ones who rule that side of the lake. Which explains why in pictures it looks like someone dumped a whole bottle of pink food coloring in there. Exactly. Those vibrant hues, they're from a specific type of algae that loves those extreme salty conditions. It's like their own little pink paradise up there. Meanwhile, the South Arm, a little less extreme, it supports a wider variety of life. Your brine shrimp, some birds, you name it. So we've got a tale of two ecosystems here, all thanks to this causeway. It's kind of amazing, actually. It is pretty wild, yeah. But for a long time, people were worried about, you know, what this division was doing to the lake. So finally, in 2016, they added a bridge to the causeway. A bridge to let the shrimp visit each other. Well, not exactly. It was to help restore some of that natural water flow between the two arms. Still early days, but it's a step towards helping the lake find a new balance. Here's hoping those two sides can finally make peace. But, you know, as we're talking about threats to the Great Salt Lake, the causeway seems almost insignificant compared to this whole shrinking water level issue. Yeah, that's the big one. And it's not just the lake itself we have to worry about. It's the whole ecosystem, the surrounding communities, even the air quality. It's all connected. Okay, definitely not a giant puddle of salt anymore. This is serious stuff. But before we dive into the heavy stuff, remind me again about that flamingo. Okay, so we've got islands, causeways, a hypersaline north arm. It's like a whole world out there. But before we get too far, you teased this earlier, the flamingo. Ah, yes, Pink Floyd. He was the Chilean flamingo that escaped from the Tracy Aviary back in 87. Wait, seriously? A flamingo on the lam in Salt Lake City? Yep. And the funny thing is, he seemed to love it here. Spent his days hanging out with the gulls and swans, feasting on brine shrimp, became quite a local celebrity. See, you'd think a bright pink flamingo would stick out in a salt lake. Guess he knew how to blend in. Or maybe everyone just decided to let him enjoy his newfound freedom. Sadly, there haven't been any confirmed sightings since 2005. He was last seen in Idaho, of all places. Pink Floyd, the adventurous flamingo, what a legend. But you were about to get into the serious stuff, the shrinking water levels. Right, so it's not just the lake itself we have to worry about. It's the whole ecosystem, the surrounding communities, even the air quality. It's all connected. Okay, definitely not a giant puddle of salt anymore. This is serious stuff. You were saying something about what happens if the lake were to disappear? It's a bleak picture, honestly. Ecologically, economically devastating. The Great Salt Lake isn't just a body of water. It's a vital part of this whole region. But it's also more than just data points. It's a place that holds a special place in our collective imagination. Legends, myths, folklore, the Great Salt Lake has it all. Okay, see, now that's what I'm talking about. We've talked about the science, the challenges, but what about the stories? What kind of tales has this salty giant inspired? Well, for starters, there's the legend of the water babies. Local folklore says you can hear the cries of infants coming from the lake, luring people to their doom. Okay, that's just creepy. Right. Then there are the stories of the lake monster, often described as this creature with a crocodile's body and a horse's head. Hold on, a crocodile head on a horse? That's what they say. It's a bizarre image, isn't it? There have been reported sightings over the years, but nothing definitive. Of course not. That's what makes a good monster story. But it's not all just mythical creatures, right? Didn't I read something about whales in the Great Salt Lake once? You're talking about the Great Salt Lake whale hoax. Now, that is a story. Don't leave me hanging. Tell me everything. Okay, so picture this. The late 1800s, newspapers are going wild with this story about a British scientist who supposedly released whales into the Great Salt Lake as an experiment. Whales in the Great Salt Lake? That's almost as strange as the horse crocodile thing. Right. It's a pretty ridiculous idea when you think about it. The lake is way too salty for whales. There goes my dream of a Great Salt Lake whale watching tour. But still, it's interesting how these stories, true or not, they tell us something about how we see this place, you know? Absolutely. The Great Salt Lake, with its stark beauty, its extremes, it really captures the imagination. It makes you realize even something as seemingly simple as a giant puddle of salt, which, by the way, I'm never calling it that again, it can hold so much history, so much wonder. I think that's a good takeaway. The Great Salt Lake, it's a reminder that even in the most unexpected places, life finds a way. And that those places, they're worth protecting. Couldn't have said it better myself. Thanks for joining us on this deep dive into the Great Salt Lake. Until next time, keep exploring.
