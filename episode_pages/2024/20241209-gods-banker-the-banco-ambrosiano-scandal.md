## Transcript

Okay, so are we ready for this? This is a story that feels like, I don't know, like a spy thriller or something. Yeah. It's the Banco Ambrosiano scandal, and it's got everything. A dead banker, the Vatican, even like Cold War intrigue. What gets me about this story is how it starts. I mean, it starts so normal. Like, you've got this guy, Giuseppe Tovini, back in 1896. Okay. Devout Catholic, lawyer, and he's like, we need a Catholic bank, you know, to help religious institutions and all that. Yeah, I was reading in some of the stuff they call it the priest's bank. Right, exactly. Which makes it even crazier when you think about where it ends up. We're talking about going from funding, like good works charities, to a billion-dollar scandal that shook the world. How does that happen? Well, things change when this guy, Roberto Calvi, comes into the picture. He becomes chairman in 1975. And he's ambitious. Starts expanding the bank like crazy, taking control of other banks, setting up companies offshore in those places where, you know, the rules are looser. He even funded a major newspaper in Italy. I feel like I've heard of this guy. Wasn't he called God's Banker or something? Yeah, he was super tight with Archbishop Paul Marcinkus. He was running the Vatican Bank at the time. So you've got this bank close to the Vatican but getting into all sorts of stuff. Not your typical banking, right? Right. I mean, they were funding political parties in Italy. Not unusual, I guess. But then it gets really interesting. They were sending money to both sides in Nicaragua. Wait, what? Yeah. The Somoza dictatorship and the Sandinista rebels? No way. Both of them. Wow. And get this, there's even a rumor they were secretly backing Solidarity in Poland. Oh, right, during the whole Cold War thing. Exactly, that union fighting against the communists. Now, whether that's actually true or not, who knows. But, I mean, just the fact that it's even possible. It tells you something about the kind of power Banco Ambrosiano had. They were messing around. No, they were playing in the big leagues, that's for sure. This is where it gets kind of shady, though. Yeah. In 1978, the Bank of Italy, their central bank, they put out this report. And they basically predict Banco Ambrosiano is going to collapse. Wow. This isn't normal, right? No, not at all. Central banks don't usually go after a specific bank like that. So that's a huge red flag. Absolutely. Something was definitely wrong. And then it gets even weirder. The guy in Milan investigating the bank gets killed by some left-wing terrorists. Oh, wow. And then the Bank of Italy official who did that inspection, he ends up in jail. Seriously? Yeah. Though he was later cleared of everything. The timing is interesting. Like someone wanted to shut this whole thing down, make it go away. That's what it looks like. Then you add in the whole P2 thing. P2. Yeah, propaganda dude, the secret Masonic lodge in Italy. Like super illegal. I've heard of the, wasn't Calvi involved? Oh, yeah. He was a member. Wow. Okay, so P2 is basically this like shadow organization, right? Pulling strings behind the scenes. Right. They had people everywhere. Government, military, finance. So in 1981, they raid P2. And guess what? They find evidence against Calvi. He gets convicted of illegal money transfers, but he's out on bail waiting for appeal. I was reading, he even tried to kill himself while he was in jail, briefly. Really? Yeah, so you get the feeling things were closing in. Like he had a lot to lose, a lot of secrets to keep. Right. And then in 1982, it all blows up. Like over a billion dollars just vanishes. A billion. Yeah, $1.287 billion to be exact. That's insane, even today. And Calvi, he's gone. Skips the country with a fake passport. So he's on the run. But it gets worse. His secretary, Graziella Coracere, she jumps from her office window, dead. And leaves a note blaming Calvi for everything. Oh man, this is dark. Yeah, it is. So what happened next? They find Calvi. Oh, they find him. Did he make it out? Oh, this is the crazy part. We'll talk about that after the break. Okay, I'm on the edge of my seat. So they found Calvi, huh? Yeah, just a few days after his secretary died, they found his body hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London. Blackfriars Bridge? That's a pretty famous landmark. Yeah. Didn't they use it in a bunch of movies and TV shows? I think so, yeah. It's pretty recognizable. And this is where they found Calvi. Yeah. It's pretty crazy, right? I remember this whole thing. It was huge E! News. Yeah. So was it suicide? Well, that's where things get complicated. Oh boy. The circumstances were super suspicious. Yeah, I remember that. I mean, think about it. He's got bricks in his pockets. Bricks? Yeah, like actual bricks. And a ton of cash in different currencies. Like he was ready to, I don't know, disappear or something. It's very strange. And then in Blackfriars. Yeah. It's like almost too perfect, you know, with the whole secret society angle. Oh, you're thinking about P2. Yeah. They call themselves Blackfriars. Right, right. It's definitely creepy. Like something out of a Dan Brown novel. So what did they say? The police, the investigators. Well, the first inquest in London ruled it as suicide. Really? But then another one came back as an open verdict. So they weren't sure? Nope. Couldn't say for sure. I remember reading somewhere that later, like years later, they decided it was murder. Yeah, that's right. Forensic experts took another look at the evidence and they concluded that, yeah, he was probably killed. So it took them, what, like 20 years to figure that out? Something like that, yeah. 2002, I think. So, okay, if it wasn't suicide, who did it? Well, there are a few main theories. Okay, hit me. The first one is the mafia. The mafia. Makes sense. Right. They lost a lot of money when the bank went under. Yeah. A billion dollars. I wouldn't be happy either. They're not known for being, you know, forgiving. Yeah, that's an understatement. So revenge is definitely a possibility. Okay, so mafia. What else? Then there's P2. Those guys again. What would be their motive? To silence Calvi. He knew too much. About their operations, about the Vatican's involvement. Right. It's possible they decided he was more trouble alive than dead. Like he was a liability. Exactly. Someone who could bring the whole house of cards down. I guess when you're playing in the big leagues, that's the risk you take. You get too close to the fire, you get burned. It's possible Calvi was both a victim and a perpetrator, you know? What do you mean? He used the bank for his own gain, for P2's schemes. But then, when it all started to crumble... They got rid of him. Exactly. So we've got the mafia, we've got P2. Was anyone ever arrested? There were trials in Italy, but no one was ever convicted. Really? Even though the courts ruled it was murder, they couldn't pin it on anyone specifically. So it's officially a homicide, but we still don't know who did it. That's right. It's like a real-life unsolved mystery. I know. And it just adds to the fascination of the whole thing, right? It makes you wonder if we'll ever know the full story. Yeah, it might just be one of those secrets that goes to the grave. Okay, so we've talked about Calvi, the mafia, P2. But what about the Vatican? They were the main shareholder in the bank, right? They were, yeah. And their role in all of this is super controversial. What do you mean? Well, there were accusations that the Vatican Bank was using Banco Ambrosiano to do some shady stuff. Like what? Like funneling money to anti-communist groups during the Cold War. Wait, so the Vatican was involved in covert operations? That's wild. I know, right? It sounds like a conspiracy theory. And is it true? The Vatican has always denied it. There's always a but. Right. After the bank collapse, the Vatican Bank paid out over $200 million to creditors. $200 million? Yeah. $224 million to be exact. That's a lot of money. What did they say it was for? They said it was a recognition of moral involvement. Moral involvement? That's a pretty expensive apology. Right. It makes you wonder what they were really involved in. So the Vatican Bank, they've always been kind of secretive, right? Yeah, they have this reputation for operating outside the normal rules. Like their own little world. Exactly. And that makes it really hard to know what they were up to. So we might never know the full story. Probably not. But the fact that they paid out that much money... It definitely raises some eyebrows. Yeah. For sure. It's like they were trying to make it go away. Sweep it under the rug. Yeah, maybe. Or maybe they were just trying to do the right thing. Who knows? It's hard to say. But it
