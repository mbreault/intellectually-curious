## Transcript

You know, it's funny how an element most people only know from Superman is actually hiding out in plain sight all around us. Today's deep dive is all about krypton. And you've given us some great material to work with, original research papers, scientific analysis, even some linguistic curiosities. It never ceases to amaze me how something we can't even see has such a rich history and surprising applications. Let's start with the discovery. Picture this. It's 1898 and chemists William Ramsey and Morris Travers are hot on the trail of new elements. But here's the thing. They're not looking at some exotic mineral or concoction. They're meticulously studying the leftovers of liquefied air. Talk about looking for a needle in a haystack. They isolate this tiny bit of leftover liquid and boom, they find krypton hiding out where no one thought to look. And the best part? This wasn't even Ramsey's first rodeo on the periodic table. The guy was a bit of an element whisperer. He went on to discover a whole bunch of noble gases, argon, neon, xenon, and even snagged a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1904. Talk about a knack for sniffing out the invisible. And speaking of invisible, the name krypton itself is a dead giveaway. It comes from the Greek word kryptos, meaning hidden. It's like they knew from the start this element was a master of disguise. So we've got this stealthy element practically invisible hanging out in the air we breathe. What's krypton like on its own when it's not busy playing hard to get? It's colorless, odorless, and for the most part chemically inert. Its content to exist in its gaseous state, not really reacting with much of anything. It's like the strong, silent type of the periodic table. Though I have a feeling even krypton has its limits. But we'll get to that later. Now you can't mention krypton without thinking about Superman and his home planet. And while we don't have any actual kryptonite in the real world, the element itself does have some intriguing variations. Krypton exists in different forms called isotopes. Some are stable, like krypton 84, the most common one, but others are radioactive, which always sounds a bit alarming at first. Radioactive? Like kryptonite? Should we be worried? Not quite. While some krypton isotopes are radioactive, they decay incredibly slowly over ridiculously long periods. We're talking millions, even billions of years. Take krypton 78, for example. It has a half-life of over nine nonillion years. To put that into perspective, that's longer than the age of the universe many times over. Okay, so no need to invest in lead-lined basements just yet. But here's where krypton's story takes an unexpected turn. This seemingly invisible inert element actually has a hand in some pretty common, even flashy technology. Remember those energy-saving fluorescent lights? Turns out krypton plays a crucial role in making them more efficient. So those lights are basically krypton-powered. I had no idea. Well, not exactly powered by krypton, but it's a key ingredient that helps them shine brighter while using less energy. And speaking of shining bright, have you ever seen those intense laser light shows? Those vibrant beams of light dancing around? Often that's krypton gas at work, adding its own flair to the spectacle. Who knew something so seemingly inert could be so flashy? It's like the quiet kid in class who secretly moonlights as a rock star. That's a great way to put it. But hold on to your hats, because here's the real mind-blower. For a time, krypton was actually used to define the length of a meter. Wait, what? How can you measure anything with a gas? It all comes down to the incredible precision of light and the unique fingerprint each element has in the light it emits. From 1960 to 1983, the official meter was based on the wavelength of a specific orange-red spectral line emitted by the krypton-86 isotope. They chose krypton-86 because its light emission was incredibly stable and reproducible. So for a while there, we had a gas setting the standard for measurement. Mind officially blown. But let's get back to krypton's chemical escapades, or should I say, lack thereof. We talked about krypton being unreactive, but just how unreactive are we talking? Picture krypton as the ultimate introvert of the periodic table. It took until the 1960s for scientists to create even one krypton compound, krypton difluoride. And even then, it took incredibly high temperatures and pressures along with some very persuasive fluorine to make it happen. Krypton difluoride. That sounds more like something out of a science fiction movie than a lab. Right. It took some serious scientific muscle to get krypton to even think about forming a bond. And even then, krypton difluoride is incredibly unstable, breaking down quickly at room temperature. It really highlights how content krypton is to be on its own. It's like krypton has commitment issues when it comes to bonding with other elements. Exactly. It much prefers to exist in its pure elemental form, thank you very much. Which of course brings us to Superman's infamous weakness, kryptonite. Okay, so maybe it's fictional, but did the creators take any inspiration from real krypton? The name kryptonite definitely plays on the element's name and the idea of this rare, powerful substance that could weaken even the strongest being. While there's no real life equivalent to kryptonite, I think it plays on the idea that even something seemingly invincible can have a hidden vulnerability. Just like krypton's aversion to chemical reactions. It's all about those hidden weaknesses, right? Even the seemingly untouchable have their Achilles heel. But what I'm gathering from all this is that krypton is a bit of a walking contradiction. Rare yet used in everyday items, chemically inert yet crucial for those dazzling lasers we talked about. Precisely. And that's what makes exploring these elements so fascinating. There's always more than meets the eye. And that's just scratching the surface of krypton's story. You provided some really interesting research on krypton's isotopes. What else can you tell us about those? You know me, always ready to dig deeper. Which krypton isotope are we highlighting first? Let's talk about krypton 85. This isotope is radioactive and has a half-life of about 11 years. Okay, so a bit shorter than the mind-bogglingly long krypton 78 half-life we talked about. What makes krypton 85 stand out from the crowd? Well, one of the things that makes krypton 85 particularly interesting is that it's a byproduct of nuclear fission. This means it's produced in nuclear reactors. And unfortunately, nuclear weapons testing as well. So krypton 85 is kind of like a calling card, a trace left behind by nuclear activity. Exactly. And because it's a gas, it can actually escape into the atmosphere. Scientists have used krypton 85 levels to track and even pinpoint the locations of clandestine nuclear facilities. It's like a real-life scientific detective story. That's incredible. It's amazing how something we can't even see can provide such valuable insights. You mentioned krypton 84 earlier as being the most common isotope. Is there anything else noteworthy about it? Krypton 84 is the most abundant isotope, making up a little over 57% of the krypton found naturally on Earth. It's also stable, meaning it doesn't undergo radioactive decay. So krypton 84 just hangs out being a stable element, no drama. Pretty much, though when we think about how we actually get our hands on krypton, it's anything but simple. Right. We briefly touched on that earlier. You mentioned it's extracted from liquid air. Yes. Krypton, along with other noble gases like argon, neon, and xenon, is extracted from the air we breathe. It's a fascinating process, actually. They cool air to incredibly low temperatures, hundreds of degrees below zero, until it liquefies. Then, through careful distillation, they separate out the different gases based on their boiling points. So we're talking about distilling air itself. That's mind-blowing. It really highlights how something we take for granted, like the air we breathe, is actually a complex mixture of elements. It's a testament to human ingenuity, that's for sure. And speaking of ingenuity, I'm curious about the limits of krypton's reluctance to react. We talked about krypton difluoride. Are there other examples of compounds scientists have been able to create, even if it takes extraordinary measures? You're right. Krypton definitely plays hard to get when it comes to forming bonds. But scientists, being the persistent bunch they are, have found ways to coax into a few other compounds. These experiments often involve extremely low temperatures and incredibly high pressures. And even then, the resulting compounds are often unstable and short-lived. It's like trying to befriend a notoriously shy creature. It takes a lot of patience, persistence, and just the right environment. A very apt analogy. And sometimes those efforts lead to discoveries that challenge our understanding of what's possible. For instance, there's been some fascinating research on krypton hydride. Krypton hydride? That's krypton and hydrogen forming a bond. I didn't even know that was a possibility. It's not exactly a walk in the park to create. It involves subjecting krypton and hydrogen to incredibly high pressures, like those found deep within the Earth, to form a special kind of crystal krypton hydride. So we're talking about recreating the immense pressure of the Earth's interior just to get these two elements to bond. That's incredible. Why go to such lengths for a compound that probably only exists for a fraction of a second? It's about pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible in chemistry. These extreme experiments help us understand how elements behave under pressure, which has implications for fields like planetary science and material science. So while we're not likely to
