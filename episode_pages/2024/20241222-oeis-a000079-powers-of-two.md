## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into the OEIS. It's always exciting to see what we uncover next. Today we're taking a look at a sequence that's both simple and complex. L00079, the powers of two. Yeah, you might think powers of two, I know those, one, two, four, eight, but there's so much more to this sequence than meets the eye. We've got excerpts from the OEIS entry itself and a section from Wikipedia that dives into the applications of this sequence in the real world. Buckle up because we're going deep. Let's start with the basics. Powers of two are just two multiplied by itself any number of times. Right, and the OEIS entry highlights that they're the only odd power of two. So any other number raised to an odd power will either stay odd or become even. Exactly. But two to any power, odd or even, is always even. It's like a hidden pattern right there in plain sight. And that's what makes the OEIS so fascinating. Absolutely, there are these subtle yet profound properties that we might overlook. The OEIS entry also points out the connection between powers of two and set theory. Oh yeah, they represent the number of subsets of a set with n elements. For example, if you have a set with three elements, you'd have two to the third or eight possible subsets. Right. So this idea of combinations, how many ways you can pick elements from a set, it's all connected to powers of two. It is, and it's not just about the calculation, it's about the underlying idea of possibilities. And how those possibilities grow exponentially. Exactly, which brings us to computer science. Wikipedia explains how powers of two are like the foundation of binary. Yeah, they dictate how many values a binary word can represent. Binary with its zeros and ones is the language of computers. And a binary word of length n can represent two to the n different values. So like when we hear about a 64-bit processor, it means that the registers, those tiny memory spaces within the CPU, can hold two to the 64th power, a huge number of different values. It's a direct consequence of how powers of two work. And this applies to memory storage, disk drives, all sorts of things. Right, even video resolutions. Even though they're not always powers of two, they're often sums or products of them. So it seems like powers of two are woven into the fabric of how computers work. They are, and it speaks to the efficiency of using a base two system for computing. Speaking of efficiency, Wikipedia also mentioned Mersenne primes. Oh yeah, Mersenne primes. These are prime numbers that are one less than a power of two. Right, like 31, which is two to the fifth minus one. And these Mersenne primes are connected to perfect numbers. Yeah, which Euclid talked about in his elements. A perfect number is a positive integer that equals the sum of its proper divisors, excluding the number itself. So for example, six is a perfect number because one plus two plus three equals six. Right, and Euclid proved that if you have a Mersenne prime and you multiply it by the power of two, that's one less than that prime, you get a perfect number. So powers of two are a key ingredient in generating perfect numbers. That's an incredible connection between these seemingly different mathematical concepts. It highlights how interconnected different areas of math can be. And Wikipedia also mentions almost perfect numbers, where the sum of the divisors is one less than the number itself. And the only known almost perfect numbers are powers of two. It is wild how this sequence keeps popping up in these unexpected places. Makes you wonder if there are any almost perfect numbers out there that aren't powers of two. It's a question mathematicians are still trying to answer. It makes you wonder what other hidden connections we might be missing. It's a reminder that even with something as fundamental as powers of two, there's always more to learn. Let's dive into some of those deeper explorations next. I'm really interested in what the OEIS says about weekly nomodal permutations and their connection to powers of two. That's a great example of how powers of two show up in unexpected places. A weekly unimodal permutation is a sequence of numbers with only one peak, like a hill. It increases to a maximum and then decreases. So like the sequence one, two, three, four, three, two, one. Yeah, exactly. And the number of these permutations for a set of n elements is two to the n. That's right. It's amazing how arranging numbers in this way ties back to powers of two. Yeah. The OEIS entry also mentions addition chains, another interesting connection. What are addition chains? Well, think about creating a number using only addition. Powers of two are the biggest number you can get for a given number of additions using the shortest chain. So for three additions, the biggest number you could make with the shortest chain is eight, which is two to the third. And that chain would be one, two, four, eight. Exactly. No other number needing only three additions can be bigger than eight. Showing just how efficient powers of two are. And if we're talking about ways to reach a value, the OEIS entry also brings up something called the staircase problem. OK, what's that? Imagine you have a staircase with n steps. OK. You can take steps of different sizes to climb it. How many different ways can you climb to the top? I imagine there could be a lot of different ways depending on the size of the steps you take. But the answer is two to the n. Wow. Another example of powers of two popping up. So we've seen connections to set theory, to computer science, prime numbers, perfect numbers, these permutations, addition chains, and even staircases. It really does seem like powers of two are everywhere in math. They really are. And we've only just scratched the surface. Well, let's keep exploring. Next, I want to look at some of the patterns in the digits of powers of two, like the cycles that the OEIS and Wikipedia mention. Those patterns offer a glimpse into the order and predictability behind the exponential growth of powers of two. Even when numbers get incredibly large, there are still underlying structures at play. Sounds like a good place to pick up next time. Let's look at the last digit first. It cycles through 2, 4, 8, 6. So 2 to the first ends in 2, 2 squared ends in 4, 2 cubed ends in 8, 2 to the fourth ends in 6. Right, and then it cycles back. And then it gets more interesting when you look at the last two digits. They cycle with a length of 20. Wow, we have to check that out later. It's a fun little math puzzle, and it brings us back to one of the reasons why powers of two are so important. Binary. Wikipedia pointed out how simple the binary representation of powers of two is. Yeah, it's either a 1 followed by 0s, or a 0, a decimal point, and then a bunch of 0s ending with a 1. And that simplicity is why powers of two are so fundamental to computing. Absolutely. It's the foundation for how computers store and process data. It's all built on this elegant binary foundation. And it's not just computers. Wikipedia even mentions how powers of two show up in music. Oh yeah, in music theory. How so? Well, you know, note durations are often expressed as fractions of a whole note. And the denominator of those fractions is usually a power of two, like a half note is one half, a quarter note is one fourth, and an eighth note is one eighth, and so on. So they're all based on this base two system. Exactly. Powers of two are the basis for the relationships between different note lengths, shaping the timing of a piece of music. Wow, that's pretty amazing how this one math concept pops up in so many different areas. It shows how interconnected our world really is. Powers of two represent more than just quantity, but also possibilities and patterns. They highlight the order and logic that seems to be everywhere. And that brings us to a bigger question. What does all this mean? Why should anyone care about powers of two? Besides using them for computers or music, I mean. Well, powers of two are a lot more than just a simple sequence of numbers. Right. We've seen them connect to set theory, number theory, computer science, even music theory. Who knows what else they connect to? It shows us how interconnected knowledge is and how seemingly simple ideas can have huge effects. It really makes you think that there's always more to discover, even with something as familiar as powers of two. And that's what's great about the OEIS. Yeah, it's a treasure trove of knowledge waiting to be explored. Exactly. Anyone can explore it. So to our listeners, we encourage you to check out the OEIS entry for A000079. You never know what you might find. Maybe you'll be inspired to tackle that open question about least efficient numbers. Or discover some new connection between powers of two and something totally unexpected. That's what makes math so cool, these opportunities for exploration. Absolutely. So until next time, keep exploring, keep asking questions, and keep diving deep into the world of numbers. And remember, even in the simplest things, there's always more than meets the eye. Thanks for joining us on this deep dive into the OEIS. We'll be back soon with another sequence. Until then, happy exploring. Yeah, it's like a challenge to find those hidden patterns and connections. It is, and that's why we encourage our listeners to take a look at the OEIS entry for A000079. Yeah, there's so much more to explore. Maybe you'll even find the answer to that question about least efficient numbers. Or maybe you'll discover a new connection to something we haven't
