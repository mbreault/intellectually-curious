Drawing on Live Science, the Royal Society of Chemistry, and the Chemistry in its Element podcast, this Deep Dive reveals the double-edged nature of discovery.

## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today we're gonna be looking at polonium. Polonium. Yeah, you know that element that you probably saw on like a periodic table quiz. Right. But maybe not much else. Yeah, it's one of the more obscure ones. But that doesn't mean it's not fascinating. Yeah, exactly. And to guide us through this Deep Dive, we've got articles from Live Science and the Royal Society of Chemistry and an episode from the Chemistry in its Element podcast. Okay. So we're gonna be trying to uncover some intriguing uses, connections to history, maybe even some pop culture references. Okay. All while kind of delving into the element's more dangerous side. Sounds like a plan. Okay, so first things first, what exactly is polonium? Right. I remember being radioactive, but can you give us kind of like the rundown on its basic properties? So polonium is a radioactive element and it's classified as a metal. Okay. And it belongs to the chalcogen group on the periodic table. Okay. Which means it shares some similarities with elements like oxygen and sulfur. Right, oxygen's family. Exactly. But I'm guessing polonium's the relative that you don't wanna get too close to at the family reunion. Yeah, that's one way to put it. Yeah. It's highly radioactive and all 33 of its known isotopes are unstable. And this instability is what makes it both fascinating and dangerous. So the Live Science article mentioned something about allotropes. Right. Is that why? Exactly, allotropes are different physical forms of the same element. Okay. So like carbon can exist as diamond and graphite. Right. Polonium also has two allotropes with differing structures and properties. So even within this one element, there's like variety. There is. And speaking of variety, Live Science also pointed out that polonium is incredibly rare in nature. Yes. You'd be hard pressed to kind of stumble upon it on a hike, right? Definitely, you'd need to be like spelunking in uranium or deposits. Oh wow. For even the slightest chance of encountering it. Okay. And even then it only exists in trace amounts. So is it more effectively produced artificially? That's right. We create it by bombarding bismuth with neutrons in nuclear reactors. So a human-made element. Essentially, yes. Okay, now I'm even more intrigued. Yeah. But before we get into like modern applications, I have to ask about its discovery. Sure. I mean, were Marie and Pierre Curie involved? Absolutely. Back in 1898, they were investigating the radioactivity of pitch blend, which is a uranium-rich ore. Okay. And that's when they stumbled upon polonium. That must have been an exciting time in science. It was. The dawn of our understanding of radioactivity. Yeah. What really struck me, though, was their decision to name it after Poland. Right. The sources mentioned that Poland was under partition at the time. That's right. Naming it after their homeland was a powerful political statement. Yeah. Especially considering the challenges they faced as scientists in that era. For sure. It wasn't just a scientific breakthrough. It was a declaration of national pride. It really adds another layer to their story. It does. And imagine the work involved in isolating it. The sources mentioned that one ton of uranium ore yields just 100 micrograms of polonium. A tiny amount. Yeah, talk about a needle in a haystack. Talk about a needle in a haystack. It took a remarkable amount of dedication. Definitely. To isolate even those tiny quantities. For sure. And Live Science mentioned that Willy Markwald independently isolated polonium around the same time. Right. Initially believing it to be a new element called radiotelurium. It was a time of great excitement and discovery. Yeah. But also confusion as scientists grappled with understanding this invisible force. So this rare, powerful element emerges from the world of uranium ore. Right. Is painstakingly isolated. And then what on earth do you do with such a thing? That's where things get really interesting. Its uses are actually very limited because of the radioactivity. That makes sense. I mean, it's not exactly something you could just casually incorporate into everyday objects. No, no, no. But it has found some niche applications. It has. For instance, it can be used in anti-static devices. To eliminate static electricity in machinery. Or to remove dust from photographic film. Exactly. Okay, that's unexpected. Yeah. But what about its more intense applications? Right. You mentioned that all of its isotopes are unstable. Yes. Doesn't that make it perfect for something like, well, an atomic bomb? Unfortunately, yes. It played a crucial role in the development of the first atomic bombs. Wow. Combined with beryllium, it was used as the initiator. Okay. The trigger that started the chain reaction. So this element that was discovered with such hope and national pride was ultimately weaponized? It is. That's quite a juxtaposition. It really speaks to the dual nature of scientific discovery, doesn't it? Yeah. The potential for both creation and destruction. And it's not just large-scale destruction we need to be concerned about. Right. This chemistry in its element podcast episode mentioned that polonium is highly toxic, even in minuscule amounts. Unfortunately, that's true. Its intense alpha radiation is the culprit. It can cause severe damage to internal organs if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed. That's a scary thought. Yeah. And if I remember correctly, there have been some high-profile cases of suspected polonium poisoning. There have been a few which really highlight the dangers of this element. Well, this deep dive is certainly shaping up to be a fascinating one. It is. We've already covered so much ground from discovery to early applications and even its darker side. Yeah. And we're going to continue exploring this intriguing and somewhat unsettling element after a word from our sponsors. Welcome back to The Deep Dive. We're continuing our exploration of polonium, an element that's proving to be full of surprises. It certainly has its share of contradictions, doesn't it? From being a key component in atomic weapons to having applications in everyday devices. Before the break, we were talking about polonium's toxicity and how dangerous that alpha radiation can be. Right. Can we dig a little deeper into that? Like what exactly makes alpha particles so harmful? Sure. Especially when they get inside the body. So alpha particles are essentially helium nuclei, two protons and two neutrons bundled together. Okay. They carry a positive charge and have a lot of energy, but they're relatively heavy and don't travel very far. So they're not like those invisible rays that can zap you from across the room? Not quite. A sheet of paper can actually stop an alpha particle. Oh, wow. But that limited penetration depth is exactly what makes them so dangerous when they're emitted inside the body. Because they can't escape easily and end up bombarding nearby cells? Precisely. It's like a tiny explosion happening on a microscopic level. Oh, wow. Those alpha particles collide with cells and disrupt their structure, which can damage DNA and lead to all sorts of problems. That's a sobering thought. Yes. It makes sense why handling polonium requires such extreme caution. Right. But I'm still struggling to reconcile that danger with the fact that it's used as a heat source in space exploration. Right. How do they manage that safely? It all comes down to careful engineering and containment. The polonium is encased in a durable, heat-resistant material. Okay. And the heat generated by its decay is then transferred to a thermoelectric generator to produce electricity. So it's like a miniature power plant. Yeah. Fueled by radioactive decay. Right. But with safeguards to prevent any leaks. Exactly. It's quite ingenious, actually. And this technology has been used on lunar rovers, right? Yes. The Live Science article mentioned Lunokhod 1 and 2. That's right. Those rovers needed a reliable heat source to keep their internal components functioning during the long, cold lunar nights. Yeah. Polonium was a perfect fit, compact, lightweight, and capable of generating a significant amount of heat as it decays. It really highlights the versatility of this element. It does. Despite its inherent dangers. Yes. Okay, let's bring it back down to Earth, literally. Okay. And talk about its use in anti-static devices. Sure. How does polonium help eliminate static cling? It might seem strange, but a small amount of polonium, usually in a thin film, is used in some anti-static brushes. So it's not like it shoots out tiny alpha particle bullets at the static. Not exactly bullets, but you're on the right track. Okay. The polonium releases alpha particles, which ionize the surrounding air molecules. Ionize, you mean give them an electric charge? Precisely. Those ionized air molecules then neutralize the static charge on surfaces, preventing that annoying cling. So it's like creating a tiny force field of charged particles to combat static. That's pretty clever. It's been used in a variety of applications, like removing dust from photographic film or preventing static buildup in textile mills. But even in those seemingly mundane applications, there's still a need for caution, right? I remember the Royal Society of Chemistry article really emphasizing the importance of properly sealing the polonium. Absolutely. Even in tiny amounts, we can't forget that it's highly toxic. Those anti-static devices are designed with safety as a top priority to ensure the polonium is fully contained. Good to know. It's reassuring to hear that there are measures in place to mitigate the risks. But it makes me wonder, if someone were to be poisoned by polonium, are there ways to detect it or even treat it? That's a critical question, and unfortunately it's not a simple answer. Detecting polonium poisoning can be quite tricky. It doesn't present with unique symptoms, so it can easily be mistaken for other conditions. So a regular doctor might
