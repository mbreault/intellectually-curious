## Transcript

Welcome back. You know, I always get excited to jump back into our deep dives into the Lucasian professors of mathematics. Oh, me too. And this is our 15th episode, so we've really covered some ground so far. Yeah, we have. It's amazing to think about the sheer intellectual firepower that's occupied that chair over the centuries, isn't it? It really is. And today, we're going to delve into the life and work of the 14th holder of this prestigious position, Sir Joseph Larmor. Ah, Sir Joseph Larmor. A fascinating figure, to say the least. Yes, he was. A pioneering figure in physics and mathematics from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We've got quite a collection of stuff to work with, too. We do. Biographical information, scientific papers, even some personal anecdotes that give us a real glimpse into who he was as a person. So we are going to try to paint a picture of this complex figure, someone who not only made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of electromagnetism, but also navigated the turbulent world of politics and even challenged some of the most famous scientific minds of his era. Sounds like a real challenge. It does, doesn't it? But that's what makes these deep dives so interesting. So where should we start? Hmm. Well, how about with his background? I always find it interesting to see how someone's early life might have influenced their later successes. Me too. And Larmor's journey from humble beginnings in McGirrgal, County Antrim, to the hallowed halls of Cambridge is quite remarkable. It really is. I mean, think about it. Born to a shopkeeper and his wife in a small village in Ireland, and he ends up becoming a Lucasian professor. That's incredible. It's inspirational, to say the least. He excelled at Queen's College in Belfast before heading to St. John's College, Cambridge. And that's where something truly remarkable happened. Yeah, tell me more. He beat J.J. Thompson to become senior wrangler in the 1880 Mathematical Tripos. Wow. Right. To top the class in one of the most demanding mathematical exams, surpassing someone who would later win a Nobel Prize. It's a testament to Larmor's early brilliance. I mean, to be that good at math at such a young age. It really is. And then the story gets even more interesting. While J.J. Thompson is credited with discovering the electron in 1897, Larmor was already referring to the particle generating electric charge as the electron as early as 1894. Wow. So he was kind of laying the groundwork for one of the most important discoveries in physics. Precisely. You could almost call him the electron's architect. It's fascinating, really. It makes you think about how some discoveries are the culmination of contributions from multiple people. It does make you wonder, doesn't it? What would physics look like today if one or the other of them hadn't made their discoveries? Big question. Who knows? But it's something to ponder. Anyway, getting back to Larmor, he is perhaps best known for his work on the Larmor formula. Yes, the Larmor formula. For our listeners who are deep into STEM, I think we should spend some time explaining this. What is it and why is it so important? Well, in essence, the Larmor formula calculates the power radiated by a non-relativistic accelerating point charge. Okay, I think that might need a bit more explanation. Sure, sure. Maybe an analogy might help. I think so. Imagine a speedboat racing across a lake. Okay, got it. As the boat accelerates, it creates waves in the water, right? The faster it accelerates, the larger and more powerful the waves become. Now, replace the boat with a charged particle, like an electron, and replace the water with an electromagnetic field. So as the charged particle accelerates, it creates disturbances in the electromagnetic field, just like the boat creates waves in the water. I'm seeing it. So those disturbances, those are what we perceive as electromagnetic radiation, like light or radio waves. You got it. And the Larmor formula, that's what lets us calculate the power of that radiation, how much energy the accelerating charged particle is emitting. That's incredible. So this formula, it became so crucial in physics because it essentially allows us to quantify something as fundamental as electromagnetic radiation. Exactly. It's crucial for understanding how energy is lost by accelerating particles. Like, it helps us understand why particles in a particle accelerator lose energy as they speed up, a phenomenon known as synchrotron radiation. Oh, I've heard of that. So this seemingly highly specialized formula actually has very real implications in various scientific fields. Absolutely. From astrophysics, where it helps us understand the radiation emitted by stars and galaxies, to medical imaging, where it plays a role in developing advanced imaging techniques, a real testament to theoretical physics. It really is fascinating. I love how we can trace the impact of theoretical work like Larmor's on such a wide range of scientific applications. You too. And speaking of Larmor's work, he also made significant contributions to our understanding of the varying nature of space and time. Yes, his magnum opus, Aether and Matter, published in 1900, explores that very thing, right? Right. But to understand it, we need to go back a bit. Back then, scientists believed in the existence of the ether. You know, the idea that just like waves in the ocean need water to travel, light needed a medium called the ether to propagate through space. Okay, so where does Larmor's work fit into all of this? Well, he was building on Lord Kelvin's work, specifically his model of spinning gyrostats. Larmor proposed that the ether could be represented as a homogenous fluid medium, and he used this model to explain various phenomena, including the propagation of light and electromagnetism. Wow, so he was essentially trying to explain the very fabric of the universe. In a way, yes. Aether and Matter really delves into that, and that's where it gets even more interesting. He independently derived a set of equations, the Lorentz transformations, we call them now. Wait, those are the equations that are central to Einstein's theory of special relativity, right? Exactly, and he came up with them around the same time as Hendrik Lorentz and years before Einstein published his work in 1905. So he was right there on the cusp of this huge scientific revolution. You could say that, but here's the thing, he remained a staunch supporter of the ether theory, even after Einstein's theory of relativity started gaining traction. Hmm, that's interesting. It seems a bit contradictory. He makes these significant contributions to physics and mathematics, yet he stays tied to this outdated concept. Yeah, it does, doesn't it? Science is rarely a straightforward path, and even brilliant minds can be resistant to change, especially when it challenges long-held beliefs. You're right about that, and that's what makes this whole story so interesting to me. It's like, how can someone be so brilliant and yet still kind of, I don't know, blinded by their own preconceptions? It makes you wonder what might have been. Right, like what would have happened if he had embraced relativity earlier? Would his contributions have been even greater? It really raises questions about the nature of scientific progress. I think it does, but you're right, his work on the Lorentz transformations, even if it was within the framework of ether theory, it was groundbreaking. It was. You can't take that away from him. It really helped lay the mathematical foundation for special relativity, even if Larmor himself didn't fully grasp its implications at the time. He was so close, yet so far. It seems like we've only scratched the surface here. There's still his political life, his later scientific work. So much more to unpack. Yeah. His story is a perfect illustration of how science doesn't always follow a neat, predictable path. And how brilliant minds can still have their blind spots. Well, this is shaping up to be a fascinating look into the life and work of Sir Joseph Larmor. I think so, too. It's a great reminder that even groundbreaking discoveries often involve contributions from many different people and that scientific progress is rarely simple or straightforward. Well said. I can't wait to dig deeper. You know, it's just amazing how someone can be so ahead of their time in some ways and yet so rooted in the past in others. I know what you mean. It's that push and pull, that tension between the old and the new that makes Larmor such an intriguing figure. Exactly. And nowhere is that more evident than in his relationship with Einstein and his views on relativity. That's right. This is where we see Larmor's deep commitment to the ether theory come into play, even when faced with growing evidence that challenged its validity. Yeah, he never really came around to Einstein's concept of curved space or the idea of relative time, for that matter. He just couldn't let go of absolute time and space. They were like cornerstones of his understanding of the universe. Exactly. He held on to the idea that time was absolute, independent of any observer, essential for astronomy and accurately measuring celestial events. It's like he couldn't quite wrap his head around the idea that time could be relative. I see what you mean. It's fascinating, isn't it? How deeply ingrained certain scientific concepts can become, even when new evidence challenges them. It can be really hard to let go. It really is. It speaks to the human side of science, you know. It's not always just about cold, hard facts. Absolutely. There's always that element of personal belief and bias, emotional attachment to certain ideas. So how did all of this manifest itself? I mean, did Larmor's skepticism towards relativity hinder his work in any way or influence his research? Well, it might seem
