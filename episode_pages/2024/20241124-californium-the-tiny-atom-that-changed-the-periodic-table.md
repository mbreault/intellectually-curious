## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. Ready for another deep dive? Today, we're going to be talking about something pretty amazing, californium. Californium. Yeah, californium. You sent over a Wikipedia excerpt about it, and well, let's just say this human-made element is in a league of its own. Oh, I completely agree. It's incredible, really. When you think about it, it doesn't exist in nature at all. Right. Scientists had to create it from scratch. So let's take it back way back to 1950, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Okay. There was this team of researchers, Stanley Thompson, Kenneth Street Jr., Albert Gyurso, and the famous Glenn Seaborg. Legendary team. They'd already made some groundbreaking discoveries. Oh, yeah. But this time, they synthesized californium, the sixth transuranium element ever found. Quite a feat, and not an easy one by any means. Definitely not. They bombarded curium with alpha particles to do it. Essentially, helium atoms stripped of their electrons, right? Exactly. But here's the thing. They only produced a tiny amount of californium-245. How tiny are we talking? We're talking 5,000 atoms. You can barely even see that under a microscope. Wow. And on top of that, this californium-245 was incredibly unstable. Oh, absolutely. A half-life of just 44 minutes. It decayed so rapidly, it must have been a race against time for those researchers. They were working with, well, they were working with a very short window, that's for sure. But you know what I find really interesting about all this? What's that? The name. Yeah. Instead of following the convention they used for elements 95 to 97, they decided to honor California. Where they discovered it. The Wikipedia excerpt even draws a humorous parallel to the Gold Rush, saying that reaching californium in the 1950s was as difficult as reaching California a century earlier. That's a great analogy. There's a certain pride there, wouldn't you say? Absolutely. It's like they staked a claim not on land, but on the periodic table, a scientific gold rush of sorts. Exactly. And it wasn't just a name. This decision really captures the scientific spirit of the time, pushing boundaries, making groundbreaking discoveries. It took another four years before they could actually produce a measurable amount of californium over at the Materials Testing Reactor in Idaho. It's quite a journey, isn't it, from invisible atoms to something you can actually weigh. That's incredible. Now, I'm curious, what does californium actually look and feel like? Well, picture this. A silvery white metal that's surprisingly malleable. If you had enough of it, you could probably cut it with a knife. Really? It wouldn't shatter. It's quite flexible. Californium has a pretty high melting point, too, about 900 degrees Celsius. Wow, that's hot. And its estimated boiling point is around 1743 Kelvin. So it can withstand some serious heat. But here's where it gets even more interesting. Californium exists in two different forms, alpha and beta. And these forms change depending on the temperature. If you apply enough pressure to the beta form, it even transforms into a distant structure. That's right, the orthorhombic structure. The Wikipedia article mentions something called 5F electron delocalization, which sounds pretty complicated. Can you break that down for us? Think of it this way. You've got these tiny electrons whizzing around inside the californium atom. And there's this specific area called the 5F orbital where some of those electrons like to hang out. Now, when you squeeze californium under pressure, it's like squeezing those electrons together. They start bumping into each other more, and they become less confined to their individual atoms. It's like they spread out. So it changes how the atoms connect. Exactly. This delocalization of electrons actually changes the entire structure of the californium crystal. It's like rearranging building blocks to make a more compact and stable structure. So under pressure, californium adapts by rearranging its internal structure. That's fascinating. And speaking of structure, the excerpt mentions that californium has a relatively low bulk modulus compared to other metals. Right. What does that mean, practically speaking? Bulk modulus is basically a measure of how resistant something is to being compressed. Think of it like a squishy stress ball versus a solid steel block. Californium, even though it's a metal, is closer to that squishy ball in terms of compressibility. It's not as rigid as, say, iron or aluminum. So we've got this element that's human-made, incredibly rare, can change its structure under pressure, and is surprisingly squishy. Now let's dive into the chemical side of things. The Wikipedia article says that californium has multiple oxidation states. Yeah, plus two, plus three, and plus four. What does that mean for its reactivity? Well, that's where californium's personality really comes out. Those different oxidation states mean it can interact with other elements in a variety of ways. How so? For example, in its plus four state, it's a really strong oxidizer, meaning it loves to grab electrons from other substances. Okay. But in its plus two state, it becomes a reducer, donating electrons instead. So it can be both a giver and a taker? Precisely. It's almost like it has a dual personality in the world of chemistry. That's fascinating. And the excerpt also mentions that it reacts with various elements like hydrogen and nitrogen. It even tarnishes in the air, especially when there's moisture present. It sounds like a pretty lively element. It certainly is. Its behavior in solutions is interesting, too. Californium is only soluble in water when it's in its plus three state. What happens then? Well, it forms what we call californium cations. These cations can then bond with other ions to form various compounds. Like what? Like chlorides, nitrates, perchlorates, and sulfates. Those are all soluble. Wow, that's a lot of chemistry. But there's one more thing about californium that's quite unique. It shows covalent properties. Covalent? Yeah, like sharing electrons. It's unusual for heavy actinides. It's like finding a penguin in the desert. It really challenges what we know about these elements. So to recap, it's incredibly rare, changes under pressure, has this dual personality when it comes to reactions, and breaks the rules of bonding. That's a lot to take in. But there's another layer to this story. Isotopes. Right, isotopes. What role do they play in all of this? Think of isotopes like different versions of californium, each with its own weight class, you could say. Each isotope has a different number of neutrons in its nucleus. That affects how stable it is, how radioactive it is. So it's like a family of californium atoms, each with its own quirks. The Wikipedia excerpt highlights the most stable ones. Californium-251 with a half-life of 898 years. That's a long time. Californium-249, 351 years. And then there's californium-250, just over 13 years. Those are some pretty impressive lifespans for radioactive elements. Absolutely, they're the well-behaved siblings, you could say. And then there's the wild child. Exactly, californium-252, intense radioactivity, relatively short half-life, just 2.645 years. But what makes it so fascinating is how many neutrons it emits. I remember reading about that. It's a lot, like 2.3 million neutrons per second, and that's for just one microgram. That's a tiny neutron factory. It's amazing how something so small can be so powerful. But how do scientists even create these different isotopes? It's not simple. It's a very controlled process. The excerpt mentions bombarding other elements with neutrons. Right. But it seems pretty complex. Oh, it definitely is. Take californium-250, for instance. Scientists bombarded beryllium-249 with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. And what happens? Well, the beryllium captures a neutron, then it transforms, and after a series of reactions, it eventually becomes californium-250. Kind of like a chain reaction. I see. And there's that amazing diagram in the Wikipedia article showing how californium-253 is made. Oh, yes. It starts all the way from uranium-238. It's like a nuclear recipe with all these steps. Neutron captures, beta decays. Right, and each step is crucial. It's a testament to how much scientists understand about these processes and the level of precision they need. It's mind-boggling. But all this effort, it leads to some remarkable applications, right? Oh, absolutely. The excerpt mentions everything. Nuclear reactors, medical treatments, even prospecting for gold. It seems like californium-252 especially is the star of the show. It really is versatile. Let's start with its role in nuclear reactors. Remember all those neutrons it releases? Millions of them. Well, they're incredibly valuable for jump-starting the nuclear chain reaction in a reactor. So it's like a spark plug for a nuclear engine. Exactly, a very important role. But its applications go far beyond that. Have you heard of neutron activation analysis? Sounds familiar. It's a technique where you bombard a sample with neutrons from californium-252. Okay. And by analyzing the radiation that comes out, you can figure out what the sample is made of. You can even detect tiny amounts of specific elements. So it's like a fingerprint for materials. Precisely, and it's used
