## Transcript

All right, so we've got a real humdinger today, folks. A real-life treasure hunt. Oh, yeah. Buried in 1993 and get this solved just this month. Wow. We're talking on the trail of the golden owl. I've heard of this. You've brought us a stack of articles about it and you want to know what made this one so special, right? Right. Let's dive in. All right, let's do it. So this wasn't just any treasure hunt. No, no. No, absolutely not. For one thing, it lasted, get this, 31 years. 31 years? That's longer than some people have been alive listening to this. It's true. It's actually the second longest treasure hunt ever recorded. Really? Second only to one called The Secret. But here's the thing. On the troll of the golden owl had just one prize. Oh, wow. One single solitary golden owl statuette. A one-of-a-kind prize for what sounds like a one-of-a-kind hunt. And get this, it was created by an artist named Michelle Becker. That's right. So imagine searching for three decades for something someone else crafted by hand. It really is something. And you know, it was valued at, get this, $150,000 back in 93. What? Oh, yeah. That's got to be, what, almost a quarter of a million today? Over $230,000 in today's money. No wonder people were so obsessed with it for so long. Yeah, you're telling me. Okay, so we're dealing with a treasure hunt that spans generations practically. Yeah. What was it about this hunt in particular, this golden owl, that kept people so invested for so long? Well, like you said, you got a stack of articles about it, so let's see. Yeah. First off, this wasn't just some mad dash for a prize, you know. This was an intricate puzzle, a true armchair treasure hunt. Right. Clues hidden in plain sight, you know, the kind. The kind where the clues are out there for everyone to see. Exactly. But the real treasure is figuring out what they mean. You got it. And in this case, with this golden owl, we're talking about 11 riddles, complex riddles, each one illustrated by Michelle Becker. Oh, so they were like works of art in and of themselves. Oh, absolutely, yeah. I mean, you think about the artistic talent involved there. Absolutely. And the brain power it must have taken to try and decipher them. I can't even imagine. Like take that riddle, ut quient laxus, for example. Oh, yeah, that's a good one. It involved deciphering a whole musical code, which eventually led searchers to a specific city. But even then, after all that, there was another layer to it, a spiral that nobody could figure out. It's incredible, Frank. It's like riddles on top of riddles. Like Russian nesting dolls of mystery. Exactly. And then there's that one that still has people scratching their heads, even though the owl's been found. When Almar allies to prenestafibula, darkness shines. Oh, yeah, that one. Can you believe that it took years just to decode the phrase that was hidden within that riddle? Years. Just to figure out what the actual phrase was. I know, years. Which, by the way, turned out to be the key is on the black perched ship. What does that even mean? Right. It's like a riddle within a riddle. And it just shows you the level of detail the hunt's creator, Max Valentin, put into this whole thing. This wasn't just toying with people. This was an art form. Absolutely. He was crafting an experience. Exactly. And speaking of Valentin, he was actively involved in this whole thing for years, even adding to the mystery. Oh, yeah, I was about to say. While those riddles were challenging enough on their own, Valentin didn't stop there. He actually engaged with the community directly through something called Max Fal. Ah, yes. This Minitel server. And now, Minitel, for those of you too young to remember, was basically like the pre-internet internet. Yeah, like a precursor to all of this. Especially popular in France in the 90s, which, again, is a testament to how long this thing has been going on. But, you know, to think that he used this technology to directly interact with the people hunting for this owl for eight whole years. Talk about dedication. That's amazing. Right. He was dropping hints, confirming or debunking theories, even revealing that there were three specific techniques needed to crack the entire puzzle. Really? He called them maps, a mega trick, and a final hidden riddle. Wow. Keeping them on their toes. Oh, absolutely. It wasn't just about solving the individual riddles. It was about connecting the dots on a whole other level. Right, you had to look at the big picture. Exactly. It's like he was saying, all right, you think you're clever. Let's see you put all these pieces together. And see the big picture. Yeah. And that's where it gets even more interesting. Oh, tell me more. I mean, what does this tell us about Valentin's puzzle-making philosophy? Yeah. And what about the thousands of people who dedicated years of their lives to this thing? Was it all about the prize at the end? Or was there something more to it? I mean, it makes you wonder with how obsessed we are with getting answers right away these days. Oh, absolutely. Instant gratification. Yeah. It's everywhere. That he created a puzzle that demanded, you know, decades even of dedication. Yeah. It's incredible when you think about it that way. Right? He tapped into that primal desire, you know, the thrill of the chase. Right. And that satisfaction you get when you finally untie a really complicated knot. Oh, absolutely. And he didn't just create a puzzle. He curated an entire experience. That's a great way to put it. That personal touch, the interactions on Minitel, that just made the mystery even deeper. Oh, it definitely added to the intrigue. Like, he understood that. How important it is to make people feel like they're a part of something bigger than themselves. And that brings us back to those three techniques that you mentioned, right? The maps, the megatrick, and the final hidden riddle. Exactly. And we can assume that the maps probably added a geographical element to it, right? Oh, for sure. So forcing people to actually go out and, like, interact physically with the hunt. Adding a whole other dimension to the armchair adventure. Exactly. But the megatrick, that's where things get really interesting. Tell me more. So the megatrick, as Valentin hinted, was this way to connect all the riddles on a totally different level. Oh, wow. You see, it forced the hunters to recontextualize everything they found. To look for patterns and connections they might have missed before. So it wasn't just about solving each individual riddle. It was about understanding how they all fit together. Exactly. This whole intricate web he'd woven. It's almost like a metaphor for life, don't you think? I do. Like, we go around gathering these little bits of information. Right, like little puzzle pieces. Experiences. And it's the connections we make between them that gives it all meaning. Creates this bigger picture. It really makes you think, huh? It does. And then, if it wasn't complicated enough already, there was that final hidden riddle. Oh, yeah. A secret within a secret. It's like Inception. I know. Makes you really appreciate how complex this whole thing was. He wasn't just challenging their minds. He was inviting them on this journey of, like, intellectual discovery. It's true, it's true. And you know what's crazy? This journey, it continued for years after Valentin himself was gone. That's right. Even after his death in 2009, the hunt went on. People were so invested, so determined. I know, they were like, we're seeing this through to the end. They even went through legal battles. Oh, yeah. Over the ownership of the owl. I mean, that's wild. That just shows you how powerful this puzzle was. Yeah. And how much it captured people's imaginations. Absolutely. Like, it became bigger than Valentin himself. It really did. Even bigger than the owl. You know, it was a symbol of perseverance. Yeah. The human spirit, exploration, and discovery, all of that. And it inspired other people. Like, look at Monty Crypto, the Bitcoin enigma. Oh, yeah, I remember that. That was a few years ago. That digital treasure hunt. Yeah. And they openly admitted that they were inspired by the golden owl. Incredible. I know. So it's like proof that a good mystery... Oh, yeah. It can have a ripple effect. It can go on to inspire a new generation to embrace the unknown, seek out those challenges, and never give up on the thrill of the chase. And you know what's funny? Even though this owl has been found... I know, right? There are still these loose ends. There are. Riddles that haven't been solved. Whispers of secrets we haven't uncovered yet. Exactly. Like that cryptic phrase, the key is on the black perched ship. What does it mean? Right. What is that? Do you think the ship is a metaphor, you know, considering all the other riddles used so much symbolism? I don't know. What if there's more to find? Right. Or maybe the real treasure was the journey all along. Maybe you're right. And speaking of the journey, there's another layer to all of this we haven't even touched on yet. Oh,
