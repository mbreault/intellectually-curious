## Description

In this episode we explore the Tribonacci sequence, defined by summing the three previous terms with starts 0, 0, 1. We uncover its rich connections to ordered trees, compositions of numbers using parts 1â€“3, and binary sequences avoiding three consecutive zeros, all captured in OEIS A000073. We also peek at matrix representations, the Tribonacci constant that governs growth, and the assorted formulas and computational toolsâ€”from Benet-like expressions to trinomial-coefficient sumsâ€”that let you generate terms.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone, to our ongoing deep dive into the OEIS. The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Yes, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, for anyone who's just joining us. It's such an incredible database. I know, and I can't believe, like, how many sequences they've already documented. It's amazing. Over 378,000. 378,000 sequences, and it's still growing. Right, and this is, it's actually the OEIS's 61st year. Wow, 61 years. Yeah, so lots to celebrate with the OEIS. And so many citations in research papers. Oh, yeah, over 11,000. Showing just how useful it is to researchers everywhere. Absolutely. So today we're focusing on a sequence that I think is as intriguing as it is fundamental, and that's A000073, the Tribonacci numbers. Ah, yes, the Tribonacci numbers. Now, you might be familiar with the Fibonacci sequence. Where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Exactly right. You start with one and one, and then you get two, and then three and five and eight and so on. But the Tribonacci sequence takes this concept and adds a little bit more complexity. A little bit more complexity? Because instead of starting with two numbers, we start with three. Zero and one, one. Zero and one. So each number in the Tribonacci sequence is the sum of the three numbers before it. So the sequence unfolds like this, zero, zero, one, one, two, four, seven, thirteen, and it just keeps growing from there. Yeah, and they get big fast. Much faster than the Fibonacci numbers. Yeah, I think it's really fascinating how this simple pattern of just adding the previous three numbers can be represented in such diverse ways. And the OEIS entry for A000073 highlights this beautifully connecting Tribonacci numbers to concepts like ordered trees, compositions of numbers, and even binary sequences. Yeah, it's amazing how these seemingly simple ideas can lead to such a rich mathematical structure. For instance, you can actually visualize the Tribonacci numbers as ordered trees with specific properties. Ordered trees. Yeah, so for those who might not be familiar with the term, an ordered tree is basically a branching diagram where the order of the branches matters. Okay, I can picture that. So take, for example, A4 equals 2 in the Tribonacci sequence. A4 equals 2. This means that there are two distinct trees with five edges where all the leaves are located at the third level. Interesting. So picture this in one tree. You have a single branch from the root and then two paths of lengths, two extending down. Okay, I see that. And then the second tree has a path of lengths two from the root with three branches extending down at the end. So both of these trees meet the criteria for A4. Exactly, hence A4 equals 2. That's pretty remarkable, isn't it? A numerical sequence encoded within the structure of these visual representations. I think so, and it really underscores the interconnectedness of these seemingly disparate mathematical concepts. It really does. It speaks to a deeper underlying structure. And this interconnectedness doesn't stop there. You can also represent the Tribonacci numbers through compositions of a number where the parts are limited to one, two, or three. Compositions of a number. Right, so for example, A5 equals 4. This signifies that there are four ways to express the number 3, which is 5 minus 2, using only 1, 2, and 3 as your building blocks. So you can have 1 plus 1 plus 1. Or 1 plus 2. 2 plus 1. Or simply 3. That's a great example. And if we delve even further into the OEIS entry, we discover a connection to binary sequences. Binary sequences, strings of zeros and ones. Right, so the Tribonacci number corresponds to the number of binary sequences of a certain length that avoid having three consecutive zeros. So think of it like flipping a coin and trying to avoid getting three tails in a row. I like that analogy. It's a fun way to visualize it. The fact that these diverse concepts, you know, trees, compositions, binary sequences, all converge on the same underlying numerical pattern, is truly mind-boggling. It really is. Makes you wonder what else might be connected to this sequence. Right, and that's where the beauty of the OEIS comes in. It just opens up this world of possibilities, prompting us to explore and uncover hidden relationships within the realm of numbers. Absolutely, and this exploration becomes even more exciting when we look at the matrix representation of the Tribonacci numbers. Oh yeah, the OEIS entry reveals how the powers of a specific 3x3 matrix can actually encode the entire Tribonacci sequence. Now let's unpack this matrix a little bit. It's got 0, 1, and 0 in the first row, 0, 1, and 1 in the second row, and 1, 1, and 1 in the third row. Okay, picturing it. And when you raise this matrix to consecutive powers, you find the Tribonacci numbers appearing in specific entries. Oh wow. In particular, the Tribonacci number, AN, appears in both the 1R2 and 3R1 entries of the matrix raised to the power of N. So there's an unexpected symmetry there. Symmetry in a sequence that grows so rapidly, it's fascinating. It really is. What's the underlying principle at play here? That's where the concepts of eigenvalues and the Tribonacci constant come in. You see, just as the Fibonacci sequence is closely tied to the golden ratio, the Tribonacci sequence has its own special constant, approximately 1.83928. Oh, okay. And this constant emerges from the eigenvalues of this 3x3 matrix we've been discussing. So if I understand correctly, this Tribonacci constant dictates the long-term growth of the Tribonacci sequence, much like the golden ratio governs the growth of the Fibonacci sequence. Precisely. It's a compelling parallel that reveals a deeper mathematical structure at play. It's like a hidden code embedded within these sequences. Exactly. And it's remarkable to think that the term Tribonacci itself has a fascinating backstory. Does it? Yeah. It was coined back in 1963 by a 14-year-old student named Mark Feinberg. Wow, 14-year-old. Sadly, he passed away a few years later, but his contribution to mathematics endures through this sequence. It's a testament to the fact that mathematical discoveries can emerge from unexpected places, and that young minds can make lasting impacts. It's an inspiring reminder. It is. And speaking of unexpected connections, the OEIS entry even mentions Charles Darwin. Charles Darwin. Hinting at a potential link between Tribonacci numbers and, wait for it, elephant populations. Elephant populations. I know. That's wild. The entry suggests that just as Fibonacci numbers have been associated with modeling rabbit populations, Tribonacci numbers might hold the key to understanding the growth patterns of elephant herds. So we're potentially connecting a purely mathematical sequence to the dynamics of living populations. It's incredible. Are there other natural phenomena that might exhibit Tribonacci-like growth? That's a great question. It certainly invites us to look for patterns in the natural world through the lens of the Tribonacci sequence. But before we delve further into potential applications, let's explore some of the methods for calculating these numbers. The OEIS entry offers a variety of formulas, each revealing a different facet of the Tribonacci sequence. Like what? Well, one fascinating formula is the Benet-like formula for Tribonacci numbers. This formula utilizes powers of the Tribonacci constant mirroring how the Benet formula for Fibonacci numbers uses powers of the golden ratio. The similarities between these two sequences are truly remarkable. They are. The Benet-like formula for Tribonacci numbers provides a direct way to calculate any term in the sequence using the Tribonacci constant. It's a testament to the elegance and power of mathematical relationships. Another intriguing formula involves summation and something called trinomial coefficients. Trinomial coefficients. Yeah, the coefficients arise when you expand expressions like x plus y plus z raised to a certain power. Right. What's fascinating is that this particular formula connects the Tribonacci numbers to Pascal's triangle. Pascal's triangle. You might recall that Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. Oh yeah, I remember that. It's a structure that appears in various areas of mathematics, including combinatorics and algebra. It's as though the Tribonacci sequence weaves itself into the fabric of mathematics, connecting seemingly disparate concepts in surprising ways. It really does. And for those who enjoy delving into more advanced mathematical tools, the OEIS entry also offers formulas involving convolutions and generating functions. Convolutions and generating functions. These provide even deeper insights into the nature and behavior of the Tribonacci sequence. It's incredible how much depth there is to this seemingly simple sequence. The OEIS entry doesn't stop at mathematical formulas. Though it provides a diverse collection of computer programs written in various programming languages, allowing you to generate Tribonacci numbers with ease. Oh wow, so you can actually experiment with these numbers yourself. Exactly. Cool. Whether you're comfortable with Maple Mathematica, PIRA, Python, Haskell, or even more esoteric languages like Magma, there's a program waiting for you to explore. That's really impressive. It really speaks to the accessibility and collaborative nature of the OEIS. It really does. It provides a platform for mathematicians and computer scientists to share their knowledge and tools, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring integer sequences. Speaking of resources, the OEIS entry for A000073 goes above and beyond, offering a wealth of additional information we haven't even touched upon. Like what else is there? Well, you'll find links to research papers delving into the intric
