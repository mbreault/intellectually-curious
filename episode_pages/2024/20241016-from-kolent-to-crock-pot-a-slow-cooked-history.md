## Transcript

Ever fire up your crock pot and think, wait, who actually came up with this thing? It's a pretty wild story, actually. It goes all the way back to a 19th century Lithuanian Jewish community. And somehow it ends with crock pots in kitchens all across America. Okay, now that's a history lesson I'm here for. So our sources take us to, let me get this right, the Jewish community in Vilna, which if I'm remembering correctly is present-day Lithuania. That's right. And that's where this whole story starts, with a dish called kolent. Kolent, okay, I'll admit I'm not familiar. So what is it exactly and what does it have to do with the crock pot? All right, so picture this. It's Friday, the eve of the Sabbath. Families are preparing for a day of rest, religious observance, the whole bit. Okay, got it. I'm picturing it. What happens next? So they'd make this, well, imagine a really hearty stew. Meat, beans, vegetables, all the good stuff goes into a clay pot. But, and here's where it gets interesting. There's always a twist. You know I live for a good twist. See, cooking on the Sabbath, it wasn't allowed. So they'd take these pots, these clay pots full of kolent, to the local bakery and kind of nestle them in the ovens, you know, among the cooling loaves of bread. The ovens were still warm, right? So that residual heat would slowly cook the stew overnight, and by morning, you had this amazingly rich, flavorful dish all ready to go. Wow, that's incredible. See, this is what I love. It's more than just a recipe, you know? It's like this whole tradition woven into the culture and rituals of the time. Makes you think, right? Every time you use your crock pot, there's this connection to the past. Okay, so we've got this ancient slow cooking technique down, but how do we jump from a community bakery in Lithuania all the way to the modern crock pot? Fill in the blanks for us. Well, that's where our friend Irving Netchimson enters the picture. Okay, Irving Netchimson. And what's his connection to all of this? Was he like a bigger extraordinaire, a kolent connoisseur? Not quite. The sources tell us Netchimson was actually an engineer, but he grew up hearing those stories, the ones about his family making kolent. And, you know, something about it must have stuck with him because it sparked an idea. He wondered if he could, you know, recreate that same slow cooking magic. So was that it? Is that the moment the crock pot was born? Not quite. It's not like he went straight from kolent to the crock pot we know and love today. His first invention was actually something called the Natcham Beanery. The Beanery. Never heard of it. Well, think about it. It makes sense, right? I mean, it was a slow cooker, but specifically designed for, you guessed it, beans. He was paying homage to the kolent that inspired him. I see. So kind of a niche market, even for the bean lovers out there. Exactly. It was a start, but let's just say the story takes an interesting turn from there. Yeah, the Beanery. It was a great start, but it wasn't exactly going to set the culinary world on fire. But our sources tell us this is where things get even more interesting. Yeah. Another player enters the scene, the rival company. And they saw the Beanery and thought, you know, there's something more here. They saw potential beyond just beans. Okay, now we're talking. A little business intrigue. Always love that. But seriously, how did we get from a slow cooker just for beans to the versatile kitchen icon that is the crock pot? So Rival, they actually bought Nachimson's company in 1970. And then just a year later, they rebranded the Beanery, gave it a whole new look, a much sleeker design. And this is the really smart part. They included a whole recipe booklet with it. Oh, that's such a classic marketing tactic, right? Show, don't tell. What better way to demonstrate that this thing is good for way more than just beans? Exactly. They understood that to make it big, they had to reposition the crock pot, show people that it was a versatile kitchen tool. And you know what's fascinating? This all happened at a really interesting time, culturally speaking. Our research points to some major shifts happening right when the crock pot hit the scene. Right, like a perfect storm in the American kitchen. Okay, so refresh my memory. What was going on back then and how did the crock pot manage to fit into all of that? So it was a time of huge change, especially for women. Think about it. More and more women were joining the workforce, which meant a rising demand for convenience foods and, of course, appliances that could make their lives a little bit easier. Makes total sense. It was the era of TV dinners, instant this, instant that. Speed and convenience were everything. Exactly. But, and here's what I find so intriguing about the crock pot story. At the same time as all this convenience food was exploding in popularity, you had this whole other movement gaining traction, back to the land movement. Right, so you have these two seemingly opposite things happening. On the one hand, you had this embrace of convenience. But at the same time, there was this yearning for home-cooked meals that returned to basics, fresh ingredients, you know? Exactly. It's almost paradoxical, right? But somehow, the crock pot managed to appeal to both sides. It was this amazing time-saver. You could prep your meal, throw it all in the pot, and forget about it until dinner. But it also gave people this sense of control, you know? They were still cooking healthy, home-cooked meals from scratch. It's like it bridged the gap between convenience and that homemade goodness. No wonder it became such a hit. Absolutely. Those cultural currents really shaped how the crock pot was marketed. I don't know if you remember those old ads, but they often showed women, you know, using the crock pot to get dinner ready ahead of time so they could, you know, enjoy their evenings, focus on other things. It just goes to show, right? Sometimes, even something as simple as a kitchen appliance can be a reflection of much bigger things, you know? Social and cultural trends, how we view things like food and time. It's pretty amazing when you think about it. It's kind of wild, right? I mean, walk into any kitchen store these days, and it's like a showroom for the latest, greatest gadgets. But the crock pot? Still going strong. Why do you think that is? What's the secret sauce? You know what? I think it's because sometimes the simplest things are just the best. It's easy to use. It's affordable, and you can cook almost anything in it. And you know what else I love about it? There's something about it that still feels connected to those older traditions, you know? Like that whole stalent thing, slow cooking in the bakery oven. It might not be a community affair anymore, but it's almost like, hmm, maybe I'll start a neighborhood crock pot swap. Now there's an idea. A modern take on an age-old tradition. See, that's a deep dive for another day. But for today, we've covered a lot of ground, haven't we? From kolent to the beanery to the crock pot's rise to kitchen fame, what do you think is the biggest takeaway from all of this? What makes this story something worth thinking about? That's a good question. I guess it's like a reminder, isn't it? Even the things we take for granted, the everyday stuff, can have these amazing histories, these stories that connect us to different times and places. I think you hit the nail on the head. It's that connection, right? The crock pot takes us from a 19th century community all the way to kitchens across America in the 1970s and beyond. It's about holding on to tradition, embracing innovation, and how we, as a culture, think about things like food and time. It's pretty remarkable. Like a little slice of history simmering away on the countertop. Exactly. And it makes you think, you know, how has our own relationship with food and cooking changed? I mean, especially now. Things are so hectic. Everyone's so busy. That need for convenience is definitely still there. But at the same time, there's that desire, maybe even a need, for a home-cooked meal, something that feels more grounded, you know? And the crock pot, it still fits in perfectly. It's more than just the food, isn't it? It's the whole experience. Like that feeling you get when you come home and the house smells like dinner, something that's been slowly cooking all day. It's kind of magical. Couldn't have said it better myself. And that actually brings me to something kind of interesting I was thinking about. We've talked a lot about the crock pot as a time saver. But what if, and hear me out on this, what if it could also help us slow down a little? You know, now that you mention it, it's funny, right? Because it's a time saver, but at the same time, it forces you to embrace that slower pace. Like you can't rush a crock pot meal, you know? Maybe, in a way, it's a form of resistance against this whole culture of instant gratification. It's food that makes you wait for it. Food for thought. Something to ponder next time you're whipping up a crock pot feast.
