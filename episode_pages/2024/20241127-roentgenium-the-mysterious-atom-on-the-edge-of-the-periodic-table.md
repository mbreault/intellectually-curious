## Description

In this episode, we explore roentgenium (element 111): its synthetic birth, incredibly short half-life, and the detective work that confirmed its existence. We unpack what scientists predict about its chemistryâ€”why a heavy, radioactive element might share kinship with silver and even gold, thanks to relativistic effects. We also peek at the island of stability and what roentgenium teaches us about pushing the frontiers of the periodic table.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. Ready for another deep dive? Always. Well, today we're taking a look at roentgenium. Oh, interesting choice. Yeah, I figured we could go back to the periodic table for this one, see what's new. I like it. So, roentgenium, element 111, not exactly a household name. Definitely not something you run into every day. Named after Wilhelm Roentgen, of course. X-ray pioneer. Exactly. And this element is every bit as intriguing as its namesake. For one thing, it's synthetic. Ah, so not something we just dig up out of the ground. Nope. Gotta make this one ourselves in a lab. And it's also intensely radioactive. Sounds a little dangerous. It can be. And the half-life of roentgenium, well, let's just say it's not hanging around for very long. We're talking seconds. Seconds. Wow, that's fast. Super fast. Yet, despite its fleeting existence, scientists believe it could share some remarkable similarities with gold. Now that's a head-scratcher. Super unstable, but maybe kind of like gold. Okay, I'm intrigued. So how in the world did we even discover something that disappears practically the instant it's made? Yeah, that's a great question. The journey to roentgenium, well, it had a few bumps in the road, you could say. I'm guessing it wasn't just mixing a couple things in a beaker. Definitely not. Back in 1986, they actually tried to synthesize it at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research over in Dubna, Russia. Ambitious. So what happened? Well, the thing about creating superheavy elements like roentgenium is it's tricky business. You're basically smashing atomic nuclei together. Trying to force them to fuse. I can imagine that's not easy. You've got it. And nuclei, well, they've got a natural repulsion to each other. Right, so you need immense force to overcome that. Exactly. So while they did produce some promising nuclei, it wasn't quite enough to definitively claim a discovery. Close, but no cigar. Oh, so close. But science demands that certainty. Absolutely. But the story doesn't end there. A few years later, in 1994, a team led by Sigurd Hoffman at the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Germany, they picked up where that first attempt left off. All right, so round two. What did they do differently? They decided to bombard bismuth with nickel nuclei. Okay, I'm no nuclear physicist, but that sounds pretty intense. It is. It's like science fiction levels of intensity. But you know what? It worked. They actually managed to create three atoms of roentgenium. Wait, three atoms? That's it? That's all it took to rewrite the periodic table? I guess every atom counts when you're dealing with something that rare. But three atoms. How can you even be sure? Well, naturally, a claim this groundbreaking needed some serious checking. So the IUPCIUPAP Joint Working Party, they scrutinized all the evidence. The scientific peer review process in action. Yep. And after a very thorough review, they confirmed it. GSI's experiment, it went down in history as the first successful synthesis of roentgenium. Officially in the periodic table. But to be extra sure, I'm guessing they didn't just stop there. Oh, you know scientists. They're all about that reproducibility. So in 2002, GSI, they did the whole experiment again. And guess what? They got three more atoms. Bingo! Three more atoms, confirming their original findings. Talk about attention to detail. Okay, so we've established roentgenium exists. It's super rare and insanely radioactive. But I've got to ask, what does all that radioactivity actually mean in practical terms? Like if we could see a chunk of roentgenium, what would happen? Good question. It all comes down to that crazy short half-life. Right, we're talking seconds, not years. Exactly. Think of it this way. Imagine a fresh baked cookie, right? Over time, what happens? It crumbles. Eventually, it's gone. Sad but true. Radioactive elements, it's like that cookie, but on an atomic scale. They decay and transform into other elements over time. And a half-life, that's just the time it takes for half of the sample to go through that decay process. Okay, that makes sense. But most stable elements, their half-lives are, well, pretty long. Billions of years, some of them. But not our friend roentgenium. Nope. The most stable isotope we know of, roentgenium-282, it's got a half-life of, wait for it, just 100 seconds. Just like that. Poof. Pretty much. It's why studying this element is a race against time. So how do you even study something that's basically disappearing as you look at it? Well, it's definitely a challenge. I bet. Do we even know what it looks like? We can make some educated guesses based on where it sits on the periodic table. Scientists believe it's probably a solid at room temperature and maybe a silvery-white color, like its lighter cousins. Cousins? Who are we talking about? Silver and gold. Oh, right. They're all in the same group, right? Group 11. You got it. So even though we can't really hold a piece of roentgenium in our hand and examine it... Because it would vanish before we could blink. Right. But we can still learn about it. Scientists have even predicted its second ionization energy. Hold on. Remind me what that is again. Basically, it's the amount of energy you need to rip an electron away from a roentgenium ion. Ah, got it. So what's the prediction? It's supposed to be pretty similar to silver's. Hmm. Interesting. So we've got this super unstable, super rare element, but it might share some properties with silver. Okay, I'm following so far. But earlier, you mentioned that roentgenium could be similar to gold. How is that even possible? They're so far apart in the periodic table. That's where things get really fascinating. Because despite being distant relatives, they're predicted to have some pretty striking similarities in their chemistry. Hold on. Chemistry. But we're talking about something that barely exists for more than a minute. How can you even begin to figure out its chemistry? That's what we're going to dive into next. It all comes down to roentgenium's place in the periodic table. Remember, it's in group 11, just like copper, silver, and gold. Right, right. They're all in the same family, but roentgenium, well, it's kind of the mysterious distant cousin, right? Exactly. And you know what's really cool? Scientists predict that roentgenium might have stable plus 5 and plus 3 oxidation states. Okay, break that down for me. What does that even mean? So oxidation states, they basically tell you how an element likes to gain or lose electrons when it forms chemical bonds. Ah, okay. So it's about how it interacts with other elements. You got it. And here's the thing. Those plus 5 and plus 3 states, they're not something we usually see with coppers, silver, or gold. So roentgenium's got some unique moves up its sleeve. You could say that. And it's all thanks to something called relativistic effects. Relativistic effects. Okay, now you're just messing with me, right? I promise, it's a real thing. Basically, when you've got electrons zipping around a nucleus as heavy as roentgenium... These things are massive, right? 111 protons. Exactly. Well, those electrons start to approach the speed of light. Whoa. Yeah. And that's when things get weird. Einstein's theory of relativity, it starts to kick in. It actually affects the way those electrons behave and ultimately how roentgenium interacts with other elements. Wow, so we're talking serious physics here. It's all connected. Relativity, chemistry, the periodic table. It's amazing. It's mind-blowing to think that we can understand these things even for an element that exists for just a few fleeting moments. But I gotta ask, what's the point? I mean, why do we even care about roentgenium? It's not like we're gonna be making, you know, roentgenium rings or anything. That's a question that a lot of people ask, and it's a valid one. But for scientists, it's not just about practical applications. It's about pushing the boundaries of knowledge. The periodic table, it's like a map of the universe. And by exploring the edges of it, by studying elements like roentgenium, we're essentially expanding that map. We're explorers charting unknown territory. Exactly. And who knows what we might find? I mean, there's this whole concept of the island of stability, this hypothetical region on the periodic table where super heavy elements, well, they might actually be stable. Ron, remind me about that island of stability thing again. Right, so we've talked about how most super heavy elements are, well, incredibly unstable. They decay in fractions of a second. But the island of stability, it's this idea that maybe, just maybe, there's a special combination of protons and neutrons that could lead to super heavy elements that are much, much more stable. Instead of, you know, vanishing before we can even blink. Exactly. We're talking years, centuries, maybe even millennia. No, that would be incredible. But why do we think this island of stability might even exist? It has to do with the way protons and neutrons arrange themselves inside the nucleus. Right, like they have these specific energy levels. You got it. And there are theories that certain magic numbers of protons and
