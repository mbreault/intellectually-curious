## Transcript

Welcome to our deep dive exploring the fascinating world of AI and mathematics. Absolutely. And today, we're going to be focusing on Google DeepMind's AlphaProof. Yes. And its groundbreaking performance at the 2024 International Mathematical Olympiad, or IMO. The IMO. For short. Yeah, for our listeners who may not be familiar, the IMO is the most prestigious pre-college mathematics competition in the world. In the world. It's essentially the Olympics of mathematics. Yes, absolutely. Drawing the brightest young minds. Mostly from across the globe. From across the globe. And to think that an AI system was able to achieve a silver medal ranking. It's truly remarkable. Truly remarkable. Yeah. To be precise. AlphaProof. AlphaProof in conjunction with AlphaGeometry 2. Yes. Successfully tackled four out of the six IMO problems. That's right. A first in the history of AI. Indeed. So let's unpack this. Yeah, let's. AlphaProof relies on several key AI techniques. One of which is reinforcement learning. Okay. Can you elaborate on how this training process works? Certainly so. In reinforcement learning, the system learns through trial and error, much like a human student would. It's given a problem and attempts to solve it, receiving feedback on its performance. And over time, it refines its strategies based on this feedback. Got it. Gradually improving its ability to solve increasingly complex problems. So it's essentially training a digital mathlete to practice and improve over time, but with the power of AI driving its learning process. Precisely. Okay. But it's not just brute force practice. Right. AlphaProof is also powered by a pre-trained language model called Gemini. Uh-huh. This model gives AlphaProof a profound understanding of mathematical language, concepts, and relationships. So it's like giving the AI a specialized dictionary and grammar guide for the world of mathematics. Exactly. Allowing it to read, comprehend, and reason mathematically. That's a great way to put it. Now, to actually solve these IMO problems, AlphaProof goes through a fascinating translation process. Yes, it does. It converts the natural language problems into a formal language called Lean. Right. And Lean, as I understand it, is a highly precise and unambiguous language for expressing mathematical statements. That's correct. Making it ideal for computer-based reasoning. Lean acts as a bridge between the nuanced world of human mathematical expression and the rigid logic of computer systems. So once a problem is translated into Lean, AlphaProof can leverage its reasoning abilities to search for a solution. Exactly. And in this reasoning process, it employs the AlphaZero algorithm. Okay. Famous for mastering games like chess and Go. Right. So it's applying game-playing strategies to the realm of mathematical problem-solving. That's the essence of it. Okay. AlphaZero's ability to explore vast possibility spaces and learn from its successes and failures proves highly effective in tackling complex mathematical challenges. Fascinating how techniques honed in the world of games can be applied to such abstract and theoretical domains. It is quite remarkable. Now, for geometry problems specifically, DeepMind deployed an upgraded system called AlphaGeometry 2. Yes. This system was trained on a significantly larger data set of geometric concepts and theorems, giving it a more powerful and efficient approach to solving geometric puzzles. That's right. So together, AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 cover a broad spectrum of mathematical areas. They do. Tackling problems in algebra, number theory, and geometry. That's correct. Only the combinatorics problems, which deal with counting, arranging, and combining objects, proved too challenging for the AI systems. Interesting to see where the current limitations lie. Yes. And how those might guide future development. But let's dive into some specific problems that AlphaProof successfully conquered. Okay, let's do that. Rishi Mehta, one of the developers, provided a detailed analysis of AlphaProof's strategies in his blog. Great blog. Which we'll link in the show notes. Yes. Shall we start with problem one? Sure. The one involving even integers. From what I gather, this problem required proving a property that held true only for even integers. Right. How did AlphaProof approach this? So AlphaProof began by setting up an integer and making a rather unintuitive claim. Remarkably, it was able to prove this claim through a series of deductions and simplifications. Okay. This led to the conclusion that only even integers could satisfy the conditions outlined in the problem. That initial unintuitive claim seems to be a key part of its strategy. It does appear so. Is this a common approach in AlphaProof's problem-solving? It does appear that AlphaProof has a knack for identifying these non-obvious connections. Right. Which is quite impressive. Yeah. Even experienced mathematicians might have missed that initial insight. It suggests a degree of creative problem-solving that we don't typically associate with AI systems. That's a very interesting observation. It seems like AlphaProof is going beyond simply applying known rules and algorithms. Indeed. There's a spark of ingenuity there. It raises some intriguing questions about the nature of creativity and whether AI can genuinely exhibit it. Okay, moving on to problem two. Okay. This one involved finding pairs of positive integers that satisfied certain conditions. Right. What was AlphaProof's strategy in this case? Well, AlphaProof honed in on the number AB plus one, where A and B represented the integers in question. Got it. It hypothesized that this number had to divide a specific value by applying Euler's theorem, a fundamental result in number theory. Can you elaborate on Euler's theorem just a bit for our listeners who might not be as familiar with it? Of course. Euler's theorem establishes a relationship between modular arithmetic and the Totient function, which counts the number of integers less than a given integer that are relatively prime to it. Got it. It's a cornerstone of number theory. And AlphaProof's ability to utilize it effectively demonstrates a deep understanding of this branch of mathematics. It's clear that AlphaProof is not simply memorizing formulas, but actually grasping the underlying concepts and knowing when to apply them appropriately. Absolutely. And this is where its training on vast amounts of mathematical data comes into play. It has, in a sense, internalized the structure and logic of mathematics, allowing it to make connections that might elude even seasoned mathematicians. That's incredibly impressive. Okay. Okay, before we wrap up this part of our deep dive. Okay. Let's touch on problem six, the one with the quasiolian function. Right. This sounds quite esoteric. Get the huss, doesn't it? This was arguably the most remarkable solution. It was. As it required AlphaProof to not only find the answer, but also construct a specific example of this very particular type of function. Right. And the function it came up with was something that even seasoned mathematicians would have found challenging to devise. I agree. So it's not just solving pre-existing problems, it's potentially contributing to new mathematical discoveries. Precisely. This highlights a potential avenue for future research. Yeah. AI as a partner in mathematical exploration and discovery. Can you give us a little more insight into how AlphaProof tackled this problem? Certainly, AlphaProof broke the problem into two parts. First, it proved that there could be at most two distinct values for a certain expression involving the Aquazillion function. Okay. Then to demonstrate that this limit of two was achievable, it had to construct a specific function that satisfied this condition, and remarkably, it succeeded in doing so. This is mind-blowing. It sounds like AlphaProof is capable of a level of mathematical creativity that we haven't seen before in AI. It certainly raises the bar for what we consider possible. But there's another crucial aspect to AlphaProof's performance that we should highlight. Okay. The fact that it not only solves the problems, but also proves its solutions in the formal language of Lean. This verification aspect is incredibly important, right? It is. It ensures the rigor and correctness of the solutions, which is paramount in mathematics. Absolutely. One of the key strengths of using Lean is that it allows for automated verification. Uh-huh. Every step AlphaProof takes in solving a problem can be rigorously checked for logical validity. This eliminates the risk of errors or unsubstantiated leaps of logic that can sometimes occur in human reasoning or in AI systems that rely solely on natural language processing. So it's like having a built-in fact checker for every mathematical move it makes. Precisely. And this level of rigor sets AlphaProof apart. Yeah. It's not just about finding plausible answers. It's about producing demonstrably true solutions backed by formal proofs. This is a significant advancement in the field of AI-powered mathematical reasoning. Absolutely. It brings a level of certainty and reliability that has been lacking in previous approaches. It moves us closer to a future where AI systems can be trusted partners in mathematical exploration, providing not just answers but also the rigorous proofs that underpin them. It's exciting. This is really cool stuff. It is. I'm excited to see where this goes. Me too. So, yeah, it's really remarkable. It is. And, you know, it's not just about finding solutions. Right. It's about establishing their validity beyond any doubt. That's what makes this even more impressive. That AlphaProof's success is not limited to a single area of mathematics. Exactly. It tackled problems in algebra, number theory, and geometry. Geometry, it's a breadth of understanding that's quite remarkable. It really is. It speaks to the power of the underlying techniques. Yeah. Reinforcement learning, language modeling, and formal verification. It seems like it's a culmination of years of research in AI, bringing together these various cutting-edge technologies to create a truly powerful system. And its performance at the IMO isn't just a technological feat. It's a milestone in our understanding of intelligence itself. That's a fascinating point. What are the broader implications of an AI system demonstrating this level of mathematical reasoning? Well, it challenges our preconceived notions about the nature of intelligence and creativity. For a long time, we believed that
