## Description

Join us as we explore OEIS A00059â€”the sequence of integers k such that 2k^4 + 1 is prime. We trace how A00059 connects to A00068 and A03796, walk through a concrete example, and discuss why these interlinked sequences illuminate prime patterns and open questions (like whether there are infinitely many such k). Along the way weâ€™ll touch on cryptography and why primes matter beyond pure theory, and invite you to dive into the OEIS yourself.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everybody, for another deep dive. And today we're gonna be looking at something a little bit different from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, or as I'm sure most of you know it, the OEIS. Specifically, we're gonna be looking at sequence A00059. Yeah, the OEIS is a pretty amazing resource. I mean, it's this gigantic database of integer sequences, and it's been incredibly useful for research in mathematics and computer science. Absolutely. And the thing about this particular sequence that really stood out to me is that it's made up of numbers, let's just call them K, where if you calculate 2K4 plus 1, you always end up with a prime number. Yeah, that's a great point. It's not immediately obvious just from looking at the sequence, though, is it? You know, you look at the first few numbers, you've got 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, and it's not like some simple pattern like you see in arithmetic or geometric progression. Yeah, exactly. So how do we actually figure out what numbers belong in this sequence? There's got to be a more systematic way to do this, right? You're absolutely right, and that's where the formula for this sequence comes in. The formula is A-N equals A00068M plus 1, 2, for N greater than or equal to 1. Wait, hold on a sec. Now we've got another sequence, A00068, popping up. What exactly does that represent? So A00068 is also a sequence in the OEIS, and this one is made up of numbers K, where K4 plus 1 turns out to be a prime number. So you can see how these two sequences are kind of related. They both involve generating prime numbers, but they use slightly different formulas to get there. Okay, I see the connection now. So to figure out a number in our A00059 sequence, we have to refer to this other A00068 sequence. That sounds a little complicated. Can you maybe walk us through an example to make this clear? Sure. Let's say we take N2, so if we plug that into our formula, we get A000682, and if we check the third number in sequence A00068, it's 4. So that gives us A242 equals 2. And if you remember, 2 is indeed one of the numbers in our original sequence, A00059. Oh, right, because 22 4 plus 1 is 257, and 257 is prime. So we essentially use the A00068 sequence as a sort of intermediary step to generate a number in our A00059 sequence. That's exactly right. The source actually gives another example, which is interesting. If we set N1, we get A1 is 0000682. Looking up the second number in A00068, we find it's 2. So A1 equals 22 equals 1, which again is in our sequence, A00059. Okay, I'm starting to see how these two sequences kind of work together to generate these prime numbers in these interesting ways. It really makes you think about all the different ways you can manipulate these numbers. Absolutely. The fact that we can use one sequence to sort of bootstrap another one, and they're both tied into generating prime numbers, it really shows you just how interconnected mathematics can be. Well, speaking of interconnectedness, our source also mentioned a connection to yet another sequence, A03796. Now, this one focuses on prime numbers that can be written in the form N4 plus 1. I mean, is this just a coincidence, or is there something more going on here? Oh, it's definitely not just a coincidence. This connection really brings out a subtle but important point. You see, our sequence, A00059, it deals with the numbers that give you a prime number when you use them in that 2K4 plus 1 formula, right? But this A03796 sequence, that one actually lists out the prime numbers themselves, the ones you can write as N4 plus 1. So they're both kind of circling around this idea of prime numbers that you get from using fourth powers, just from slightly different perspectives. Exactly. A00059 gives you those K values, and A03796 gives you the actual prime numbers you end up with. It's these kinds of connections that make number theory so fascinating. Yeah, it really shows how you can have these seemingly different ideas that are actually deeply connected. And I know we've got a lot of listeners out there who are into STEM stuff, and I bet they're already thinking about the applications of all this, especially when it comes to prime numbers. Oh, absolutely. Prime numbers are incredibly important in a lot of fields, especially in cryptography. A lot of the security we rely on for things like online transactions, it all comes down to how hard it is to factor large numbers into their prime factors. Yeah, it's pretty mind-blowing how these abstract mathematical concepts can have such a huge impact on the real world. It really is. And this is just scratching the surface, really. Prime numbers also play a big role in things like coding theory, hashing algorithms, even random number generation. Understanding these sequences and how they relate to prime numbers, it can really open up a whole new level of understanding in those areas. Before we move on, there's a question I've been wondering about. Does this sequence, A00059, I mean, does it just keep going forever? Are there an infinite number of numbers that work in that formula? Or is there some sort of largest number that satisfies the condition? That's a great question. And honestly, mathematicians are still trying to figure that out. There's no definitive answer yet. It's still an open problem in number theory. So we've stumbled onto a real mathematical mystery here. Exactly. And that's what makes number theory so exciting. There's still so much we don't know, so much left to explore and discover. Makes you wonder if one of our listeners might be the one to crack this mystery someday. I wouldn't be surprised. The OEIS is like a treasure chest full of mathematical wonders just waiting to be found. Who knows what other connections and patterns are hiding in there? Wow, this deep dive has really given us a lot to think about. We started off looking at this sequence, A00059, this list of numbers that lead to prime numbers when you use them in a certain way. Yeah, and as we went along, we found this really interesting connection to another sequence, A00068, which is like a key to understanding how to generate numbers in our original sequence. Right. We also talked about how it's connected to A03796, which shows just how closely related all these different ways of looking at prime numbers can be. Absolutely. It's these kinds of connections that really demonstrate how complex and fascinating number theory can be. Even something that seems simple on the surface can have all these layers of depth to it. And the fact that there are still unanswered questions, like whether A00059 goes on forever, it just adds to the mystery and intrigue of it all. It definitely does. It's a good reminder that even in a field like mathematics where we've learned so much, there's always more to uncover and discover. Well, to all our listeners out there, especially those of you who are into STEM, I'd really encourage you to spend some time exploring the OEIS. You never know what you might find. I agree. As we've seen today, looking at these sequences can give you a whole new understanding of the fundamental building blocks of mathematics and how they're used in all sorts of fields. So thanks for joining us on this deep dive into the world of integer sequences and prime numbers. Until next time, keep exploring and keep asking those tough questions.
