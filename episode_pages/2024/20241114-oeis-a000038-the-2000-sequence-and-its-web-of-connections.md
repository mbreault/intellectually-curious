## Description

We dive into A000038, a deceptively simple OEIS entry that starts with 2 and then zeros. We'll explain how it's described as twice A00007 and how that relation lets us see A000038 as a shifted, doubled building blockâ€” a doorway into a larger network of sequences. We discuss the formula involving A00000 and the prime counting function, plus the Mathematica and Prague sections that show how to generate terms with code. We'll touch on the cross-references to Euler's totient function and the ways this tiny sequence intersects group theory and even machine learning, illustrating the power of the OEIS as a collaborative, interconnected library.

## Transcript

All right. So, you know how much we love getting your suggestions for deep dives. Oh, yeah. Well, this time you guys really threw us a curveball. Yeah. We're talking about something called A000038. At first glance. I know, right? It looks like some kind of secret code. Yeah. Or something like that. It's a sequence of numbers, but not just any sequence. This one is part of something called the OEIS. The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Yeah. Have you ever heard of this? I have. It's really an incredible resource. It's like Wikipedia. Yeah. Imagine like a vast digital library where mathematicians from all over the world can contribute these unique sequences. And it creates this interconnected web of mathematical knowledge. So is A000038 like just one tiny entry in this massive crowdsourced encyclopedia? Exactly. And it's just one of millions. Wow. Each sequence gets its own unique ID number in the OEIS, which makes it easy to catalog and cross-reference. Let's get down to it. What does this sequence A000038 actually look like? Well, it starts with the number two followed by an infinite string of zeros. Okay. So two, zero, zero, zero, and so on. Hmm. That's a little underwhelming, honestly. Yeah. Is there something more to this than meets the eye? That's where things get interesting. Okay. You see, this seemingly simple sequence has some surprising properties. For starters, the OEIS entry describes A000038 as twice A00007. Twice A00007. Which is another sequence in the encyclopedia. Okay. So it's related to another sequence. Right. But what does that tell us? Why is that significant? Well, think of it like this. The OEIS is full of these relationships between sequences. Sometimes a seemingly complex sequence can be generated from a simpler one, or a sequence can be a building block for many others. Right. In this case, understanding A00007 could give us some insights into A000038. We'll have to explore that connection later. Definitely. But is there anything else about A000038 that makes it stand out? Here's a real aha moment. Okay. The entry also mentions that A000038 represents the decimal expansion of 15. Wait, so that string of zeros is just .2? Precisely. It's a simple fraction, but the fact that it could be represented as this infinite sequence of integers is fascinating. Yeah. It bridges this world of whole numbers with the world of decimals and fractions. Hmm. I'm starting to see why you said this has surprising properties. Yeah. So we have a simple sequence that can be expressed as a fraction. What else can we learn from this A000038 entry? Well, one of the most intriguing things is that even though it looks so simple, A000038 is actually connected to some pretty complex mathematical concepts. Like what? If we look at the comments section on the OEIS page, we see mentions of prime numbers. Our numbers. Which are like the building blocks of all whole numbers. That's a surprise. What's the connection there? It's a bit too deep to dive into right now. Okay. But essentially, this seemingly simple sequence with its infinite zeros can help us understand some of the properties and patterns of prime numbers. Okay, now I'm really curious. The comments hint at these hidden depths. But can we actually calculate any number in this sequence or is it just an endless list of zeros? Well, that's where the formula section of the OEIS entry comes in handy. Okay. Mathematicians have actually created a formula that allows you to calculate any term in the A000038 sequence. Hold on, there's a formula for this? There is. What does it look like? Well, it involves another sequence called A00000. Okay. And something called the prime counting function. Oh, right. We won't get into the nitty gritty right now. Okay. But the point is, this formula exists and it allows us to explore this sequence in a deeper way. So it's like a shortcut. Exactly. Instead of having to list out the entire sequence, you can use this formula to find any specific term you want. Incredibly useful when you're dealing with an infinite sequence. Yeah. All right, so we've got this formula, we've got a connection to another sequence. What other cool things can we find on A000038's page? Well, there are sections called Mathematica and Prague. Mathematica and Prague. And they actually provide code snippets showing how to generate this sequence using computer programming. Oh, so even programmers are interested in this sequence. It goes to show that the OEIS attracts people from all sorts of backgrounds, not just mathematicians. Right. It's a real melting pot of anyone who is fascinated by numbers and patterns. Okay, so we've gone pretty deep on the sequence itself, but you mentioned earlier that each sequence in the OEIS is like a fingerprint for a mathematical concept. What concept does A000038 represent? That's where we start to see the broader significance of this seemingly simple sequence. Okay. The references section of the OEIS entry reveals that it's been cited in research on some pretty diverse topics. Give me some examples. We're talking group theory, which deals with the symmetries of objects. Okay, that sounds pretty abstract. It is, but it gets even more interesting. A000038 also pops up in research on machine learning. Machine learning, so this sequence of two and a bunch of zeros is connected to artificial intelligence. It seems that way. It really highlights how even the most basic mathematical concepts can have unexpected applications in different fields. This is making me see the OEIS in a whole new light. It's like this giant web connecting different areas of math and even reaching into other fields like computer science. Absolutely. But how can we explore these connections further? Well, there's a cross-reference section on each OEIS page that links to related sequences. For example, for A000038, we see a connection to A0007395, which deals with something called Euler's Totient function. I have to admit, I have no idea what that is, but I'm guessing it's another thread we could pull on to learn more. Exactly. And then there's the adjacent sequences section, which simply lists the sequences with ID numbers just before and after A000038. Oh, so it's literally showing you what's next door in this giant neighborhood of numbers. It gives you a sense of how everything in the OEIS is interconnected. You know what this reminds me of something we talked about, A000038 being connected to A000007 earlier? Of course. Remember that? It's time to follow that trail. Let's do it. What can you tell me about this A000007? Its title in the OEIS is the characteristic function of A0 unless n0, in which case An1. Okay, I'm going to need you to break that down for me. Essentially, it's a sequence where every term is 0 except for the very first term, which is 1. Okay. So it looks like this 1, 0, 0, 0. And so on. At first glance, it seems even more basic than A000038. But remember, even the simplest things can be surprisingly complex. Right. What makes A000007 interesting is its role as a fundamental building block. What do you mean building block? Well, it shows up in a lot of mathematical formulas and concepts as a way to switch on a specific term or condition. Okay. It's like a light switch. It's either on one or off. Okay. So A00007 acts like a signal highlighting a particular point in a sequence or an equation. Precisely. And if we remember that A00000 is defined as twice A00007. Yeah. It means we're basically taking that simple signal, doubling its intensity, and shifting it one position to the right. Ah, that's how we get the 2 at the beginning of A000038. Exactly. It's the one from A00007 doubled and moved over one spot. Exactly. It's a simple operation, but it creates a whole new sequence with its own unique properties and connections. This is making me see these sequences in a whole new light. They're not just lists of numbers. They're like encoded messages waiting to be deciphered. That's a fantastic way to put it. Each sequence in the OEIS tells a story. And often that story intersects with others in unexpected ways. If we kind of zoom out a bit, what's the takeaway for our listener? Why should they care about the OEIS and these seemingly obscure sequences? Well, I think the OEIS is a testament to the beauty and interconnectedness of mathematics. You know, it shows that even in something as simple as a sequence of numbers, there's infinite depth and wonder waiting to be discovered. It's like a reminder that there's always more to learn, even in the things that we think we understand. Absolutely. And it's not just about the math itself. You know, the OEIS is a prime example of the power of community and collaboration. It's this living, growing database built by people from all over the world who share this passion for numbers and patterns. It's incredible to think about all the volunteers contributing to this vast library of knowledge. So we've got A000038, which you said is twice A00007. Right. We've also got this formula that you mentioned uses something called the prime counting function. Yes. Can you tell us more about what that is? Certainly. So the prime counting function is like this special tool that mathematicians use to count how many prime numbers exist up to a certain number. Okay. So for instance, there are four prime numbers less than 10. Okay. Two, three, five, and seven. Right. So the prime counting function gives us a way to calculate that for any number, no matter how large. So in the formula for A000038, this function helps determine how the sequence behaves based on the distribution of prime numbers
