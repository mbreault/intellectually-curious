## Transcript

Alright, so we've got some excerpts here from the Wikipedia page on the Border Gavaskar Trophy. Oh yeah, looks like a good one. And it looks like someone's ready for a deep dive into this India-Australia rivalry. Definitely. So let's jump right in. Sounds good. We're going to try to figure out why this trophy is so special in the world of cricket. Okay. Explore some of the most memorable moments from its history and see how it reflects the bigger picture of this competition between these two giants of cricket. Yeah, should be fun. Now just in case anyone needs a refresher. Sure. Test cricket is like the marathon of cricket. Okay. It's a five-day match where skill and patience and strategy are all put to the test. Yeah. And it's considered the pinnacle of the sport. For sure. The highest standard. Absolutely. So the Border Gavaskar Trophy. Yeah. It's right up there with the Ashes. Okay. When you talk about how prestigious it is and how competitive it gets. Yeah. It's not just about winning. It's about national pride and carrying on this legacy. Oh yeah. Of two legends. Yeah. Alan Border and Sunil Gavaskar. The namesakes. Exactly the namesakes of the trophy. I was surprised to learn. Oh yeah. That this trophy was first officially contested back in the 1996-97 season. Okay. That seems kind of recent considering how long India and Australia have been playing each other. Well you're right. Their history goes way back. Yeah. Even before Indy's independence. Wow. They had an unofficial test series back in 1935-36. Hmm. And then the first official series after India gained independence was in 1947-48. Okay. So by the time they came up with the Border Gavaskar Trophy. Yeah. They'd already had decades of this intense competition between them. Right. So that really adds to like the weight. Exactly. Of this trophy. Yeah. And speaking of intense competition you pointed out this thing called the home advantage phenomenon. Oh yeah. It seems like India and Australia are almost unbeatable when they're playing on their home turf. Yeah. It's a trend that you can't miss. It just jumps out from the Wikipedia page. Right. India has won 8 out of 9 series at home. Wow. And Australia has won 4 out of 7 at home. Hmm. As of 2022-23. Yeah. It's almost like two different games are being played. Yeah. For sure. What is it about playing at home that makes these teams so dominant? Well it goes beyond just being familiar with the conditions, you know. Right. The pitches themselves play a massive role. Oh okay. In India you've got those pitches that are famous for being spin friendly. Right. But it's not just that. Okay. It's the soil type. Yeah. How they prepare the pitches. Yeah. It all creates conditions where the ball turns sharply. Okay. Which gives a huge advantage to Indian spinners. Right. Like Harbhajan Singh and Ravichandran Ashwin. I remember Harbhajan's hat trick against Australia in 2001. Oh yeah. That was a classic. Yeah. Classic example of a spinner just dominating on home soil. So I imagine it's kind of a similar story in Australia. Yeah. But with pace instead of spin. You got it. Pitches in Australia are known for their bounce and pace. Makes it really tough for visiting batsmen. Right. While giving Australian fast bowlers. Yeah. Like Pat Cummins and Mitchell Stark. Oh yeah. A huge edge. Yeah. It really shows you how much the conditions can just completely dictate how a series plays out. And that's what makes those rare occasions when a team wins away from home. Yeah. So memorable. Definitely. You pointed out a couple of these epic away victories. Like Australia's win in India back in 2004-05. Oh that was huge. Yeah. They ended a 35 year drought for Australia on Indian soil. Wow. Damien Martin was absolutely key in that series. Yeah. His technique was so solid. But it was more than that. Okay. It was his mental game that really stood out. He never seemed phased by the spin. Right. And he was so good at rotating the strike building partnerships. Yeah. It really frustrated those Indian bowlers. And then on the flip side you have India's recent streak in Australia. Yeah. Winning three series in a row down under. Unbelievable. In 2018, 19, 20, 21, and 22, 23. Amazing. That's got to be a pretty sweet feeling for Indian fans. It's incredible. I mean there's no other way to say it. Yeah. It really shows how the balance of power has shifted in recent years. Take the 2018-19 series for example. Yeah. Cheteshwar Pujara was like a wall for India. Oh yeah. His determination and his ability to just bat for hours completely wore down that Australian attack. Yeah. It wasn't just about technique. Yeah. It was that mental toughness that made the difference. So we've got this backdrop of intense rivalry. Right. The home advantage factor. Yeah. And then these amazing moments of away victories. For sure. Now I want to dive into some specific series that have really defined this trophy. All right. In your notes here it looks like the 2001 series in India. Oh yeah. The one they call the final frontier. Right. Really caught your eye. Oh it's got everything. Drama brilliance. A story that had the whole cricketing world glued to their seats. Imagine the Steve Waugh's Australian team. They were on this unbelievable 16 match winning streak going into this series. Wow. They were considered practically unbeatable. Really? Oh yeah. The question was could they conquer India? Yeah. The final frontier on their quest for like total domination. Right. And it started pretty much how everyone expected. Yep. Australia won that first test pretty easily. All right. But then Kolkata happened. Yeah. And things took a bit of a turn. Things took a dramatic turn. India was asked to follow on. Oh wow. Now for those who aren't familiar with the rules of test cricket. Sure. That basically means that after being bowled out in their first innings they had to bat again right away. Oh wow. Because they were trailing by a huge margin. Right. Only three teams in history had ever won a test match after being asked to follow on. So the odds were stacked against them. Big time. Yeah. But then what happened was one of the most incredible comebacks. Oh yeah. In cricket history. For sure. VVS Laxman played in innings for the ages. Oh yeah. 281 runs. Wow. Batting for over 10 hours. That's incredible. And he had great support from Rahul Dravid. Yeah. Who scored a gritty 180. And let's not forget about Harbhajan Singh. Oh yeah. His bowling including a hat trick. Wow. Completely changed the momentum of the match. I can only imagine what the atmosphere was like at Eden Gardens. Oh the energy was unreal. Yeah. It wasn't just a cricket match. It was like a clash of titans. Wow. The momentum shifted and India went on to win the series 2-1. Yeah. They ended Australia's winning streak and really established themselves. Right. As a force to be reckoned with in world cricket. And I bet that series had a big impact on both teams. Oh definitely. Yeah. It showed Australia that they weren't invincible. Right. And it showed India that they could beat the best in the world. It was a turning point for the Border Gavaskar Trophy. Okay. From then on both teams knew they could win no matter where the series was played. And speaking of captivating cricket. Yeah. The 2007-08 series in Australia was another one that stands out. Right. You even flagged the infamous Monkeygate incident that happened during that series. Yeah. That's one that kind of overshadowed some brilliant cricket. Right. And it's important to understand what happened. So during the Sydney Test match there was this dispute. Yeah. Involving Andrew Simons. Right. An Australian all-rounder of Caribbean descent. Okay. And he alleged that he was racially abused. Wow. By members of the Indian team. And this wasn't just like a small argument on the field. No. It became a huge international controversy. Really? It strained relations between the teams, sparked debates about racism in cricket, and it even involved diplomatic interventions. Wow. It led to a lot of soul-searching within the cricketing community. Yeah. And a review of how incidents like that were handled. Yeah. It was a reminder that sportsmanship and respect have to come first even when the competition is fierce. Absolutely. But amidst all that controversy. Yeah. India achieved something pretty remarkable. Okay. They managed to end Australia's 16-match winning streak. Wow. Again? Yeah. This time in Perth. Really? It showed how resilient they were and their ability to perform even in a hostile environment. And in the following series back in India in 2008-09, Sachin Tendulkar reached one of the biggest milestones in cricket history. That's right. He became the highest run scorer in test cricket. Incredible. Surpassing Brian Lara's record. What a moment. It was a testament to his longevity, his skill, his passion for the game. For sure. And it was a moment that went beyond the rivalry. Absolutely. And captivated the entire cricketing world. For sure. And what about the more recent chapter in this rivalry? Yeah. It seems like India has been really dominant over the last few years. They have. They've won four out of the last five series, haven't they? That's right. It's been a really impressive run for India. It really has. It seems like there's been a
