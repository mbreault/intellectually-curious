## Transcript

Hey deep divers, you ready to explore some more of the solar system with us? I'm definitely ready. Well this time we're going to Mars, the red planet, and we are launching this deep dive from its Wikipedia page, which might seem a little pedestrian, but honestly I was kind of blown away by how much cool stuff is in there. Yeah, it's actually a really densely packed Wikipedia page, like most of them are. And that's kind of our mission today, is to unearth those fascinating details about Mars that I think a lot of people overlook. Absolutely. For instance, did you know that a day on Mars is just a bit longer than an Earth day? I did know that actually, yeah. But a year is almost twice as long. Yeah, that's a long time to wait for your birthday. That's a long time. Yeah. So time moves very differently on Mars than it does here. It does. Before we get ahead of ourselves, I kind of want to rewind the clock a bit and go back billions of years to the very beginning of Mars. Okay. What can you tell us about those early days, and what would it have been like to stand on the surface back then? So imagine this, you're standing on the surface of early Mars, and you might be greeted by a sight that's surprisingly familiar. Okay. Vast oceans stretching across the northern hemisphere. Really? Yeah. And in the distance, volcanoes erupt, spewing lava and ash into the atmosphere. Wow. So very active, very geologically active. Oh yeah, very much so, very Earth-like in that period. Wow. But what's truly awe-inspiring is the canyon system that cuts through the landscape. Okay. Making the Grand Canyon look like a tiny crack in the sidewalk. This is Valles Marineris, stretching across a distance equivalent to the entire continent of Europe. The size of Europe. The size of Europe. That's almost impossible to wrap my head around. It's gigantic. It really paints a picture of a young, active Mars that almost sounds like it could have been hospitable. Yeah, it does. And this period, known as the Noachian Epoch, was followed by the Hesperian, a time of even more intense volcanic activity. Wow. Yeah. So picture massive floods carving out channels into the planet's surface. Really? Some of those channels were so powerful they could drain an area the size of the United States in just a few days. Wow. That's hard to even fathom. Yeah, it's hard to wrap your head around. So we're talking cataclysmic events shaping the Martian landscape. Cataclysmic, yeah. It's incredible to think about those early days, almost like Earth in a way. What happened? How did Mars go from potential oceans and erupting volcanoes to the dusty red planet we see today? Well, that's where things get really interesting to understand, that we need to look at something called the Martian dichotomy. Okay. So imagine slicing Mars in half. Okay. You'd find something incredible, a tale of two planets. Okay. The north is relatively smooth with vast plains. Okay. But the south is a completely different story. Okay. It's a rugged, heavily crater highland. Huh. Almost like a giant hand punched the planet billions of years ago. Okay, now you have to tell us more about this tale of two planets. Yeah. What could cause such a dramatic difference between the north and the south? One prevailing theory is an impact event so colossal it boggles the mind. Okay. Picture this, an object maybe the size of Pluto slamming into Mars billions of years ago. The energy released would have been unimaginable, literally reshaping the planet's surface and potentially even stripping away much of its early atmosphere. Wow. To put it in perspective, if a similar impact happened to Earth... Yeah? Well, let's just say it wouldn't be good. It'd be a very bad day for everyone. That's a bad day for planet Earth. But this impact theory, as catastrophic as it sounds, helps explain how Mars transitioned from a potentially Earth-like planet to the colder, drier world we see today. Yeah, that's right. It's the best explanation we have right now. So we've got ancient oceans, erupting volcanoes, and then wham. Right. A planet-altering impact. It really sets the stage for Mars as we know it today. Okay, so we've traveled billions of years from a Mars that sounds surprisingly Earth-like to this massive impact that really changed the planet's trajectory. Right. But let's fast forward now to today. What's it like on Mars now? Well, you can say goodbye to those oceans. Mars today is a cold, dry desert world. Okay. It's about half the size of Earth. Okay. And its surface is covered in this fine reddish dust, which is where that red planet nickname comes from. Yeah, that rusty hue is pretty hard to miss even from Earth. Yeah. But even though it's a desert, Mars has some seriously dramatic landscapes, right? Oh, yeah. The Wikipedia page mentions Olympus Mons. Right. I was floored to learn that it's three times the height of Mount Everest. It's gigantic. Yeah. Olympus Mons is a true behemoth. Wow. And it's not just tall, it's incredibly wide too. Imagine the entire state of Arizona covered by a single massive volcano. Wow, that's incredible. Yeah. What's fascinating is that Olympus Mons is actually a shield volcano, which explains its size. These types of volcanoes erupt lava that flows very easily, spreading out over vast distances. Exactly. And here's another mind-blowing detail. On Earth, plate tectonics move the crust around, creating chains of smaller volcanoes as magma rises. Okay. But Mars doesn't have plate tectonics in the same way, so that one spot just kept erupting. Wow. Building Olympus Mons higher and higher over billions of years. So it's like a giant volcanic pancake. Yeah, you could say that. And speaking of giant features, what about Valles Marineris? Right. We talked about its incredible size earlier. Yeah. But what else makes this canyon system so unique? Well, imagine this. You're standing at the edge of Valles Marineris, and you look across this massive chasm that stretches as far as the eye can see. The scale is simply mind-blowing. But what's even more fascinating is how it formed while the Grand Canyon was carved by the Colorado River. Right. Valles Marineris is thought to have been ripped apart by tectonic forces. Wow. So we're talking about forces so powerful that they literally tore the Martian crust apart. Exactly. It really makes you appreciate the incredible geological forces that shaped this planet. Yeah, it's hard to even wrap your head around it. But here's the million-dollar question with all this talk about ancient oceans. Is there any chance water still exists on Mars today? You're right, that's the question that drives a lot of Mars exploration. Right. And the evidence for past liquid water is pretty compelling. Yeah. We see signs of it all over the planet, from those ancient riverbeds to the dendritic valleys that branch out like veins across the surface. Wow. We've even found minerals like jarosite and gypsum, which form in the presence of water. Okay, so lots of clues about a wetter past. But what about now? Here's the thing. While Mars has water, most of it is locked up as ice, think polar ice caps like we have on Earth. Right. But also beneath the surface in what's called permafrost. So it's like a giant cosmic popsicle. In a way, yes. Okay. And that makes it tricky for liquid water to exist on the surface today. The atmosphere on Mars is extremely thin, about 1% the density of Earth's. Right. And the pressure is very low. So if you were to pour a glass of water on Mars today, it would either freeze quickly or evaporate into the thin atmosphere. Wow. It wouldn't have a chance to just pool and flow like we're used to seeing. So we have evidence of past water, but finding liquid water on Mars today is going to be like searching for a very elusive cosmic needle in a haystack. Exactly. And that has big implications for the possibility of life. Right. Which, speaking of it, brings us to another fascinating aspect of Mars. I mean, the possibility of life on Mars is probably the biggest question scientists have grappled with for centuries. Oh, absolutely. It's fascinating to think about those early astronomers peering through their telescopes, sketching what they thought were canals. Right. Built by Martians. Yeah. I mean, it really shows how our understanding of Mars and our place in the universe has evolved over time. Right. I mean, imagine based on these blurry images, people were convinced that there were intelligent beings constructing these elaborate irrigation systems on Mars. It sounds like something straight out of science fiction. It really does. But even though those canals turned out to be an optical illusion, it's incredible how that idea fueled our imagination. And it didn't stop there. Yeah. We've had H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds, countless other books and films. And who could forget Marvin the Martian? Exactly. It speaks to that innate human desire to explore the unknown. Right. The search for life beyond Earth. And even though that little green men narrative has shifted, the discoveries we've made since those early observations have been just as awe-inspiring. Think about those iconic images from the Viking missions in the 1970s. Right. The first spacecraft to land on Mars or the rovers like Curiosity beaming back data and incredible photos as we speak. Yeah, it's amazing. It's like having our own eyes on the surface of another planet. Exactly. And each mission has brought new discoveries. For example, remember when Curiosity found evidence of organic molecules in Martian soil? Oh, yeah. That was a huge moment for understanding the potential
