## Description

Dive with us into OEIS A000021, the sequence that counts how many integers up to 2^n can be written in the form x^2 + 12y^2. Weâ€™ll unpack this quadratic form as a geometric blueprint, explore its ties to Landauâ€™s ideas about primes, and connect it to Jacobiâ€™s four-square theorem. Along the way weâ€™ll glimpse the web of related sequences (like R000021) and meet the mathematicians who laid the groundwork, from Shanks and Ke Schmid to the broader tapestry of number theory. This is number theory as a web of hidden connectionsâ€”easy to state, deep to understand.

## Transcript

All right, everyone get ready because today we're going deep. Deep. Into the world of number sequences. Yeah. These are strings of numbers that... They seem so simple at first. Simple at first, but then you realize they unlock these amazing mathematical secrets. Absolutely. And you know what I think is really cool about these sequences is that they show these connections in math that you wouldn't expect. Oh yeah. So we'll see how a really basic sequence can lead to these things like quadratic forms, which are basically like blueprints for shapes. For shapes. Okay. Yeah, and we're going to be talking about the work of some really interesting mathematicians who thought about these things. Are you excited? I am excited. Yeah. So for this deep dive, we are using a pretty awesome tool. Yeah. The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. It's great. Or OES. Or OES. For short. Yeah. Imagine, if you will, a giant library. Yes. But instead of books, it's full of integer sequences. Yeah. And each one has its own story. Its own story. Yeah. And the specific sequence we're diving into is A000021. Okay. This one represents the number of positive integers. Oh, wow. Less than or equal to. Okay. Raised to the power of n. Okay. They can be expressed in the form x squared plus 12y squared. I know that might sound a little complicated. Yeah, a mouthful for sure. But stick with us. Stay with us. We're going to break it down. We'll break it down step by step. Yeah. And you'll see how much depth is hidden in this sequence. Yeah. All right, so we've got nx and y in this formula. Right. Can we just start with an example so we can... Sure, absolutely. See how it all works. Let's look at the example they give in the OEIS entry, A4-6. Okay, so in this case, n is 4. That's right. So that means we're looking at 2 raised to the power of 4, which is 16. Okay. And we're trying to find all the positive integers less than or equal to 16. Less than or equal to 16. That can be expressed in that form we talked about, x squared plus 12y squared. So we just need to play around with different values of x and y. Yeah, you got it. Okay. Until we find the right combinations that give us... A result. Less than or equal to 16. Less than or equal to 16. And they actually list out the numbers for us in the OEIS entry. Oh, they do? Yeah. Okay, cool. It's 1, 4, 9, 12, 13, and 16. Okay, so 1 is just 1 squared. 4 is 2 squared minus 3 squared. Okay, but where does the 12y squared part come into play? That's a good question. Yeah. So if you look, we've also got 12 on the list. Right. Which is just 12 times 1 squared. Oh, okay. And then there's 13, which is 1 squared plus 12 times 1 squared. Okay. And then 16 fits perfectly. That's 4 squared. As 4 squared, exactly. Okay, so there are 6 numbers that fit this criteria. 1, 4, 9, 12, 13, and 16. And that's why... And that's why... A4 equals 6. A4 equals 6, exactly. It's like a little math puzzle. Yeah. Trying to figure out which numbers fit. Absolutely. Okay, so that's cool. Yeah. But is there like a bigger picture here? There is a bigger picture. Oh, there is. This sequence actually connects to a broader concept in number theory. Oh, wow. Called quadratic forms. Quadratic forms. Yeah, have you heard of those? I mean, maybe back in like high school math class or something. Okay, well, it's not as scary as it sounds. Okay. Think about quadratic forms as like mathematical blueprints for shapes. Okay. Like parabolas. Okay. You know those curves you see? Right, like the arc of a ball? Yeah, exactly. Or something like that. Or a satellite dish, those kinds of things. Okay, I can kind of picture that. Yeah. So our formula x squared plus 12y squared is like one specific blueprint in this whole world of shapes. Okay. You got it. So by exploring the sequence, we're kind of... We're exploring the world of... Going into the world of... The shapes and their properties. Okay, that's pretty neat. Yeah. It's not just crunching numbers. It's like... It's like uncovering this... Uncovering the hidden geometry behind them. Yeah. Is that why mathematicians? It's definitely a part of the appeal. I find this so fascinating. And actually, in the OEIS entry, they mention a couple of mathematicians. Okay. Like D. Shanks. Okay. And L. Ke Schmid. Right. Who've explored this sequence in connection to this... Oh, wow. ...theorem by Landau. Landau's theorem. Yeah. That sounds... It's a bit complex. Intense. But the basic idea is that it deals with... Okay. ...the distribution of prime numbers. Prime numbers, okay. Yeah. You know, those building blocks of all numbers. Right, right. So this sequence is like a secret code. It's a pretty amazing connection. Prime numbers. Yeah. The fact that this sequence, which seems to be about counting in squares, is somehow tied to... Prime numbers. Prime numbers. That's pretty crazy. Yeah. It suggests there's something deeper going on. Yeah, it's going way beyond... It's like plugging in numbers. It's like there's a whole other... Hidden layer. ...layer of like math order. Yeah, and that's not all. Oh, there's more. Remember those mathematicians we mentioned? Yeah. Their work shows that this sequence has been studied very seriously. Wow. Yeah. So every time I think I have a grasp on this... Right. ...it gets deeper and deeper. And more intriguing. What else is hidden in this sequence? Well, there's another aspect we haven't even talked about. Okay. The connections to other sequences in the OEIS. So there are other sequences... Yeah. ...that are related to this one. Yeah, like a whole family of mathematically related sequences. Wow, so it's like this web of ideas. Exactly. And each sequence gives you a different... Yeah, different perspective. Perspective on the same underlying mathematical principle. Exactly, yeah. Good, neat, huh? So I'm picturing like this massive web of all these sequences. It's a good way to think about it. And just like exploring the links between web pages can lead you down these rabbit holes. Yeah. Following these cross-references in the OEIS can lead to surprising connections. So what sequences are linked to A000021? Well, there's one that I thought was interesting. Okay. R000021. Okay. This one represents the number of ways to write a number as the sum of four squares. Sum of four squares. Okay, that sounds familiar from math class. Back to high school math. Yeah, how does that connect to our sequence? Right, so how does that connect to x squared plus 12y squared? Yeah. It's a cool link. Okay. It takes us deeper into number theory. Okay. There's this theorem called Jacobi's four-square theorem. Okay. Which basically gives us a way to calculate... The number of ways to express a number as a sum of four squares. So how does that theorem relate to our sequence? Well, if you look at our formula, x squared plus 12y squared, we can rewrite it as x squared plus 2 squared times 3y squared. Okay, I see that. Right. It's starting to look like the sum of squares. Yeah, exactly. Right. So we're kind of manipulating the formula. Yeah. We're revealing this hidden connection. It's like a magic trick. Yeah. Okay, so this connection... So this connection... Opened up by this Jacobi's four-square theorem. Yeah, opens up like a whole new avenue. Okay. For exploring number theory. It's amazing how these seemingly separate concepts... I know, it's really cool. ...are all intertwined like that. Yeah, it makes you wonder. Yeah. What other connections are out there? Yeah, what other hidden relationships? Yeah. I noticed something else in the OEIS entry. Okay, what's that? For A000021, the formula section. Oh, yeah. It's a little dense? It can be a bit dense. For a non-mathematician. But the formula is kind of like the engine that drives the sequence. It's this compact expression that captures the whole pattern and allows us to calculate any term... Oh, wow. ...without having to do it step by step. So it's like a shortcut. Yeah, it's like a shortcut. Okay. To understand the sequence on a deeper level. So we've got these formulas to help us understand the sequence. But what about just like the actual values? Yeah, what about the numbers themselves? Yeah, so the OEIS entry gives us a list of the first few. Uh-huh. But what happens as we go further down the line? That's a great question. Yeah. As n increases, the values in the sequence grow really fast. Okay. It's like a rocket taking off. Which makes sense, right? Because we're looking at larger powers of 2. Exactly. So there are more numbers... More numbers to test. To test. That's the formula. Yeah. And the possibilities just explode. So understanding how fast it grows and how it behaves as it goes towards infinity... Right
