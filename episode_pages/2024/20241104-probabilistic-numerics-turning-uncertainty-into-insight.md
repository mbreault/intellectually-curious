## Description

In this Deep Dive, we explore probabilistic numericsâ€”the blend of numerical analysis, probability, and machine learning that outputs distributions rather than single numbers. Weâ€™ll unpack why uncertainty matters, how Bayesian ideas add builtâ€‘in error bars, and how uncertainty can be carried through chains of computations. Realâ€‘world relevance shines in integration, optimization, linear algebra, and differential equations, with examples from climate modeling and finance. Weâ€™ll also trace the history (PoincarÃ© and Solin), touch on gameâ€‘theoretic perspectives, and point to practical tools like ProbNum.

## Transcript

Hey everyone, welcome back for another Deep Dive. Today we're going to be tackling something pretty mind-bending. Something called probabilistic numerics. Yeah, it's a really cool area where math and statistics and even machine learning kind of all come together. Exactly. So you know how computers are like total wizards when it comes to crunching numbers, right? Yeah. But have you ever stopped to wonder like how they actually solve those complex problems? You know, like figuring out the area under a curve? Yeah. Well, that's where numerical analysis comes in. It's all about finding ways to approximate solutions to these really hard mathematical problems. And that's where things get really interesting because there's this whole new twist on numerical analysis. Right. Probabilistic numerics. It's basically saying, hey, what if we could add a layer of smart guessing? You know, like using probability to make those approximations even better. Yeah, and that's what we're going to be exploring today. So instead of just getting like a single answer from a calculation? Yeah, like traditional methods would just give you one number and that's it. Exactly. But with probabilistic numerics, you get a whole probability distribution. It's like a range of possible solutions and it tells you how likely each one is. So instead of just saying, here's the answer, it's more like, well, here's a bunch of possible answers and here's how much you should trust each one. So it's like imagine your GPS. Instead of just giving you one estimated arrival time, it gives you a range of possibilities and maybe even says, hey, there's like a 20% chance you'll hit traffic on this route. Right. It gives you a much better sense of the uncertainty involved, which I think is super important when you're dealing with real world problems, you know? Absolutely. And that's just like scratching the surface. There are so many advantages to this approach. Like one of the coolest things is you get these built-in error bars. Think of it like a trustworthiness score for your answer. So it's not just, here's the answer, but also, here's how much you can rely on this answer, which feels like a total game changer, especially when you're dealing with complex problems where you know certainty is kind of an illusion. Exactly. And since we're talking about probability now, we can bring in these super powerful techniques like Bayesian inference, you know? Ah, Bayesian inference, always a good time. Right. It's like imagine being able to automatically fine-tune all those little parameters and algorithms. Like you had an army of tiny assistants adjusting all the knobs and dials to make sure everything's running perfectly. Ah, this is blowing my mind. It's like we're taking those Bayesian methods that have been so successful in machine learning and applying them to the very foundation of how we do computations. It's almost like we're giving computers a touch of intuition, wouldn't you say? That's actually a really good way to put it. And another cool thing is that probabilistic numerics is built to handle the messiness of real-world data. Oh yeah, because out there in the real world, you've got those noisy measurements, those gaps in our knowledge, all that fun stuff. Exactly. And traditional methods, they kind of stumble over those imperfections. But probabilistic numerics, it can actually use them to refine its estimates. Wow, so it's like having a computational engine that's not just powerful but also super resilient. Exactly. Like you can navigate those bumps and potholes of imperfect information and still come up with a pretty good answer. I bet this is incredibly valuable in fields like climate modeling or financial forecasting, where uncertainty is just a fact of life. Absolutely, those are great examples. And it gets even more interesting because with probabilistic numerics, you can chain computations together and actually carry that uncertainty through each step. So you can see how the wobbliness in one part of the process kind of ripples through to the final result? Exactly. It's like having a built-in audit trail for your calculations, showing you exactly where those uncertainties are coming from. Okay, so not only do we know how much to trust the final answer, but we also understand where that uncertainty comes from, which is super helpful. It's like having a detailed map of all the potential pitfalls in your computational journey. I like that analogy. And another really cool feature is that it can seamlessly blend different sources of information. So it's like a master chef combining ingredients to create a richer, more nuanced flavor, right? Yeah, exactly. It's a game changer for fields like inverse problems, where you're trying to figure out the underlying causes based on the effects you observe. Kind of like a detective using clues from different sources to get a more complete picture of a crime. Precisely. All right, so we've talked about all these amazing advantages, but I'm dying to know, where is this actually being used? Give us some real-world examples. Sure. Let's start with something you might be familiar with, integration. So we're talking about calculating the area under a curve, right? Exactly. But remember, with probabilistic numerics, it's not just about finding an answer. It's about understanding the quality of that answer. So like knowing how much wiggle room you have in that estimate, which is super important when you're making decisions based on those calculations. Exactly. Now, how about optimization? We're always looking for the best solution to a problem, right? Right. But what if we don't have all the information? Probabilistic numerics lets you embrace that uncertainty. So it's like navigating a maze with limited visibility. Yeah, that's a great way to put it. It helps you find the best path forward, even if you can't see the whole picture. That's awesome. Now let's move on to linear algebra, which is like the backbone of so many computations. Right. Solving systems of equations, that's a super common task. But the thing is, our data and our computations are rarely perfect. Yeah, they're messy and full of errors and all that. Exactly. Think about, like, reconstructing a 3D model from a bunch of noisy sensor readings. Probabilistic numerics can take those imperfections into account and give you a much more realistic and robust solution. It's like having a sharper lens that can see through the blurriness of that imperfect data. Absolutely. Yeah. And then there are differential equations. Those equations that describe how systems change over time, right? Yeah. Imagine you're trying to simulate the spread of a disease, but your data on transmission rates is kind of limited. Which is often the case, especially early on in an outbreak. Right. Well, probabilistic numerics can help you factor in that uncertainty, giving you a range of possible outcomes and how likely each one is. So it's not just about predicting the future, but it's about understanding all the different ways the future could unfold. That's a much more realistic way of looking at things. Exactly. And even in deep learning, where neural networks are all the rage right now, right? Probabilistic numerics is making waves there, too. Think about all those parameters you have to tune in a neural network. Things like learning rates and batch sizes. Yeah, there are tons of them. Right. Well, probabilistic numerics can actually help tune those parameters automatically, making those networks more efficient and more robust. It's like giving your neural network a self-tuning mechanism. Exactly. Now, to understand where all of this came from, let's take a little step back in time. The roots of probabilistic numerics actually go back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. So it's not just a recent fad. There's some serious history behind it. Exactly. There were these pioneers like Henri PoincarÃ© and Albert Solin, and they were already exploring this intersection of numerical analysis and probability back then. So they were laying the groundwork for this revolution in computational thinking. Exactly. Like PoincarÃ©, he was fascinated by the idea of using probability to fill in the gaps in our knowledge. You know, like imagine you have a function, but you only know its values at a few points. How can we use probability to estimate what the function's doing at all those other points? So acknowledging that we often have to work with incomplete information, and we can use probability to make those educated guesses about the missing pieces. Exactly. And Solin, he made some really important contributions to the field of numerical integration. Okay. He showed that in a statistical sense, the trapezoidal rule, which is this classic way to approximate areas, is actually the best approach under certain conditions. Wow. Which was this groundbreaking insight because it linked a traditional numerical method to a probabilistic framework. So we're starting to see those connections between these seemingly different areas of math. Exactly. And it gets even cooler because there's this really fascinating connection between probabilistic numerics and game theory. Oh, tell me more about that. Well, it turns out you can view some numerical problems as like a game that you're playing against nature. Okay. You're trying to get the best solution, but you've got limited information, just like a player in a game trying to make the best move when they don't know everything. That's a really cool way to think about it. So it's like computation isn't just about blindly crunching numbers. There's this element of strategy and decision making involved. Exactly. And this connection to game theory has really helped us understand how important information and uncertainty are in computation. All right. So we've got this powerful new way of thinking about computation, but how do we actually put it into practice? Are there tools that can help us harness the power of probabilistic numerics? Absolutely. The field's come a long way, and now there are all sorts of software tools specifically designed for probabilistic numerics. Ah, that's awesome. So what are some of the big names to look out for if you're interested in exploring this world? One of the big ones is ProbNum. It's a Python library. Okay. And it's got this huge collection
