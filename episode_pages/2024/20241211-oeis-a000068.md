## Transcript

Welcome back to The Deep Dive. We're continuing our journey through the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. And today, we're diving into A000068, a sequence with a really neat connection to prime numbers. The OEIS, it's an amazing collection of mathematical patterns, really. And A000068, it's a perfect example. You could even say it's a prime example. Ha ha. Exactly. Of how a simple formula can lead to, well, some pretty deep mathematical questions. Okay, so let's get right into it. What makes A000068 so special? So this sequence, it defines numbers, we can call them K, where K to the fourth power plus one gives you a prime number. Okay, so like if K is 2, 2 to the fourth power, that's 16 plus 1 is 17, and 17 is prime. So 2 would be part of this sequence. Exactly, you got it. And the sequence keeps going, finding all the K values that fit this prime generating formula. The first few terms are 1, 2, 4, 6, 16, 20, and it goes on from there. So it's like a club, but a very, very specific entry requirement. You got to generate a prime number using that formula. Uh-huh, I like that, a very exclusive club. And you know what's really interesting? How this sequence connects to, well, a special kind of number. We call them Fermat numbers. Ooh, Fermat numbers. Now those take me back to my number theory days. Remind me about them. So Fermat numbers, they're written in this form. 2 raised to the power of 2 to the N plus 1. For example, if N is 2, you get 2 to the power of 4, which is 16. Add 1, you get 17, which is a Fermat number. And as we just saw, also a prime number. Okay, now I'm seeing a pattern here. Both these formulas, they involve raising a number to a power of 2 and then just adding 1. Is there more to it than that? Are they really connected? You're right, there is a deeper connection. See, the sequence we're looking at, A000068, it's like a subset of Fermat numbers. It's the Fermat numbers that are prime, but when the base is something other than 2, a bit more selective, you could say. Like a VIP section within the already pretty exclusive club of Fermat numbers. Yes, exactly. And Pierre de Fermat, the mathematician these numbers are named after, he had this idea, this conjecture, that all Fermat numbers were prime. Ah, right. But that turned out to be not quite right, didn't it? Right, it wasn't true. Leonhard Euler, back in 1732, he figured out how to factor the fifth Fermat number, proving it wasn't prime, which opened up, well, a lot of questions about these numbers. So some Fermat numbers are prime, some aren't. What does that mean for our sequence, for A000068? That's where it gets really interesting. We know prime numbers, they become less and less common as numbers get larger. That makes A000068 even more complex. It's generating primes, but those primes are getting harder and harder to find as the sequence goes on. So does it ever end? Is there like a biggest K value that works for that formula? That is a great question. And it actually leads to one of the biggest unsolved problems in number theory. Mathematicians are still trying to figure it out. Does this sequence go on forever or does it eventually stop? We don't know yet. Wow. We've gone from a pretty simple sequence to like mysteries of prime numbers and unsolved problems. It's kind of amazing how these basic ideas can lead to such big questions. It is, isn't it? It's the beauty of math and there's still so much to explore. Now let's talk a bit more about those fascinating properties of Fermat numbers and how they connect back to our friend A000068. Yeah, I'm ready to go even deeper. Let's see what makes these Fermat numbers so special. Well, one thing is that no Fermat prime, other than 3 and 5, can be written as the difference of two powers where the power is an odd prime. It's a bit complicated, but it tells us something very fundamental about how Fermat primes are different from other primes. Okay, so they play by their own rules, kind of? You could say that. And here's another interesting thing. Except for the first two, every single Fermat number ends in the digit 7. Huh. So they can be super complex but still have these simple patterns. Exactly. And then there's this. The sum of the reciprocals of all Fermat numbers, it's irrational. Meaning if you take 13 plus 15 plus 117 and keep going for all Fermat numbers, you get a number you can't write as a simple fraction. Wow. So even when you flip them and add them up, they still have this wildness to them. It's like every part of these numbers can lead to more discoveries. Like we're looking at different sides of the same coin. A000068 on one side, Fermat numbers on the other. And both are tied to the mysteries of prime numbers. Yeah, it's pretty cool how these kind of basic math ideas, they can lead to such complicated stuff. And it's not just theoretical either. Fermat numbers, like you mentioned, they have some actual real-world uses too. Oh really? Like, I'm curious. Well, like in computer science, specifically with pseudorandom number generation. Those are algorithms, basically. They make sequences of numbers that seem random, but they're actually determined by a formula. And large Fermat primes are really helpful in these algorithms. So it's like controlled randomness. Why is that so important for computers? Exactly. Controlled randomness. Think of things like cryptography or simulations. You need those random numbers to be as unpredictable as possible. If the sequence is too short or it repeats, it can cause problems like security holes or bias. But Fermat primes, they help make those sequences longer and stronger because of their unique properties. Okay, so they're like the secret ingredient to making good randomness. It's funny to think about these abstract math things being used in the digital world. It just shows how everything is connected, you know? Math, computers, it all ties together. And it's not just about randomness either. The way Fermat numbers are structured, it works really well with data structures and computer science. A lot of them have sizes that are powers of two. Right, it's all coming full circle. The beauty of Fermat numbers, it shows up in the way we actually design computer systems. Exactly. But let's not forget about A000068, our original sequence. We've been talking about how it's connected to Fermat numbers, but even figuring out if a big Fermat number is prime, that can be really tough. Factoring those huge numbers, it takes a ton of computing power. So how do we even know which ones are prime? Especially when they get so gigantic. Luckily, there are some special tests. They're made to check if a Fermat number is prime. One of them is called Peppin's test. It's really efficient. It tells us if a Fermat number is prime, but without all the work of factoring it. Wow, that's like a shortcut. Through a really, really complicated math maze, we started with just one sequence, and now we're talking about prime numbers, their weird properties, and even how they're used in the real world. It's been quite a journey. What's next? Well, to really get a handle on all of this, we got to talk about something called generalized Fermat numbers. It takes everything we've learned, and, well, it expands it. Instead of just using two as a base, we can use any two numbers. Let's call them A and B, as long as they're co-prime. So it's like A to the power of 2 to the N plus B to the power of 2 to the N. But A has to be bigger than B, and B has to be bigger than 0. Co-prime. Can you remind me what that means again? Sure. Co-prime numbers, they don't share any divisors except for 1. Like 15 and 28 are co-prime. Their only common divisor is 1. With generalized Fermat numbers, this is important because it makes sure A and B, they don't have any hidden factors in common, you see. So it's like we're looking for prime numbers, but using a more flexible formula. You got it. And that opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Just like with regular Fermat numbers, we want to find those cases where these generalized Fermat numbers turn out to be prime. I'm guessing they're just as rare as the regular ones? You would be right. They're super rare. The more bases we add, the fewer primes we find. It's like trying to find one specific grain of sand on a beach that keeps getting bigger and bigger. But, you know, mathematicians, they have found some really massive generalized Fermat primes using supercomputers and those big distributed computing projects. It's crazy to think about, you know, how big the number system is and how we're still finding these super rare primes. This deep dive has been a real math adventure. It has been, hasn't it? And, you know, we're not done yet. There's one more thing about this sequence I want to talk about, something really cool. I know, right? We started with this simple sequence, A000068, and now we're talking about all these different kinds of Fermat numbers. What else is there? Okay, so let's take a step back for a
