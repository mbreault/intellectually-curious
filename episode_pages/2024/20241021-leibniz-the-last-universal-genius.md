## Description

A deep-dive into the 17thâ€‘century polymath whose work spanned calculus, philosophy, computing, and diplomacy. We explore how Leibniz earned the title of 'the last universal genius,' from monads and space-time relational ideas to the dream of a universal language and early calculating machines. Along the way, we examine his grand ambitions, the calculus controversy, practical inventions, and the enduring question of how one mind tried to unify all knowledge.

## Transcript

Hey there. Ready to take a deep dive? Today we're tackling Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Oh, a fascinating choice. I know, right? This guy, Wikipedia boldly calls him the last universal genius. Last, huh? A bold claim. Right, and he has a Wikipedia page. It's more like a laundry list of accomplishments. Philosophy, math, you name it. Well, it does make you wonder, doesn't it? Does he live up to the hype? Exactly. Yeah. So, where do we even start with a guy like this? Well, this universal genius thing is as good a place as any, I suppose. What makes Leibniz worthy of such a title? I mean, the guy practically oozes polymath vibes. He really does. Just imagine growing up with a personal library crammed with law books, philosophy, theology, all in Latin. That was Leibniz's childhood. Talk about pressure. But it wasn't just the content, you see, it was the range. His father's collection, it wasn't just about making him a scholar, it was about exposing him to, well, everything. Like his upbringing was engineered to create a renaissance man. Exactly. And speaking of renaissance men, Leibniz even dabbled in poetry. Wrote 300 lines of Latin verse as a teenager. 300 lines? Was that like a teenage phase or something? More than that. It reveals a fascination with language, with its structure that would actually underpin his later work. You know, on logic, the universal language idea. Wow. So he was destined for greatness from the get-go. It seems so. But even geniuses face rejection, you know. Did you know he was initially denied a doctorate in law? Seriously, why? Too young. Can you imagine? No way. What were they thinking? It does make you wonder, doesn't it? But even then, he wasn't just going through the motions. Leibniz was publishing work on philosophy, arguing for connections between law and philosophy. This was a teenager, remember. This guy was operating on a whole other level. He really was. Okay, so speaking of operating on different levels, we have to talk calculus. Everyone knows Newton, but Leibniz has a claim to it too, am I right? Oh, absolutely. Major, major drama there. Drama? What happened? It turned into a whole priority dispute. Accusations of plagiarism flying left and right. Oh, wow. This isn't just some academic squabble. Whoever gets credit for calculus, that shapes the trajectory of mathematics. Exactly. Like, imagine if Leibniz's notation had taken hold earlier. Would we even be thinking about math differently today? It's mind-blowing. So different schools of thought, approaching the same problem, different methods, different notations. It makes you wonder, doesn't it? It really does. Okay, but back to Leibniz. It wasn't all just abstract math with him. He seemed to find a way to apply it to everything. He really did. Like, his idea to use windmills for mining. Ah, yes. The windmills. You have to remember, though, it's the 17th century. Innovation looked quite different then. That's true, that's true. But Leibniz, he was obsessed with using technology, you know, to improve everyday life. So even if the windmill project was a swing and a miss... It was. It still says something about him. He was a practical guy. Absolutely. Like, he was constantly searching for ways to make the world a better place. And not just through thinking, but through actual, tangible inventions. He wanted to see his ideas put to work. Precisely. And it wasn't just technology either. He was super into diplomacy, right? Trying to prevent wars, I think I read. Oh, absolutely. The man was practically a one-man League of Nations. Centuries ahead of his time. Seriously. And his Egyptian plan. Have you heard of that? Egyptian plan. Ringing a bell, but I need a refresher. Fascinating stuff. It's a perfect example of his strategic thinking, but on a geopolitical scale. And how'd that go? Let's just say, it backfired spectacularly. Oh no, really? Which kind of speaks to another side of Leibniz, don't you think? Yeah. His grand visions didn't always quite translate into real-world success. Ah, so it's like even geniuses make mistakes. Exactly. And his work for the House of Brunswick, another example. The Brunswick what now? The history. He was commissioned to write a grand history of the House of Brunswick. Oh, right, right. And? And. What happened? Don't leave me hanging. Volumes and volumes of research, funded by the electors. And did they ever get to see it finished? Nope. Oh, those poor electors, they had no idea. Right. But it just goes to show, sometimes that amazing range of his worked against him. Too many irons in the fire. You could say that. Okay, let's switch gears for a second. Enough about politics and history for now, we gotta talk about these monads. Ah, the monads. They sound like something straight out of a science fiction novel. Right. Okay, imagine, right? If every atom had its own little movie reel, its entire past and future encoded inside. Okay, that's a wild visual. I'm with you so far. That's basically the gist of Leibniz's monad idea. It's kind of his way of explaining the universe, but with a twist. A twist. It's like atoms, right? But each one totally unique. Each one containing a blueprint for all of time. Okay, now my brain is starting to hurt a little. Right. Mind-bending stuff. But it's a great example of how his mathematical mind, it influenced his philosophical ideas, too. It's all connected. Exactly. And speaking of philosophical ideas, we can't forget about his best of all possible worlds concept. Oh, right. Didn't that concept really get under Voltaire's skin? It did. What was it about that idea that caused so much controversy? Well, Leibniz was saying that a perfect God, well, he must have created the best possible world, right? Okay, I see where this is going. Centuries of debate. Suffering, free will, you see. How could a world with so much pain and suffering be the best possible? Yeah, that's a tough one to swallow. Right. It's a question that still resonates, even today. Big questions. No easy answers. Exactly. But it's important to ask them, don't you think? Absolutely. And, you know, it wasn't all just abstract philosophy for Leibniz, either. He also liked to tinker with calculating machines, right? I did. Was he like the grandfather of computers or something? As for computers, absolutely. Binary code, the idea of a universal language for thought. Wait, hold on. He was thinking about that stuff back then? Oh, absolutely. And it wasn't just some pipe dream for him. These ideas, they were deeply connected to his work, you know, on logic and math. So ahead of his time. He even sketched out a machine, you know, to solve differential equations. No way. That's incredible. Right. Okay, let's try to connect some of these dots here. We've got monads, calculus, calculating machines, a universal language for thought. It's almost like he saw the universe as this giant, intricate machine, all governed by logic and math. And that's what's so fascinating about Leibniz. He wasn't just good at different things. He saw the connections between things, you know, the underlying patterns. He was looking for a unified theory of everything, centuries before anyone even thought to call it that. Exactly. He was on a constant quest for a unified theory of knowledge. Some way to bring all those diverse interests of his under one big framework. Which is probably why he was so passionate about creating scientific societies, right? Places where people from different fields could come together and bounce ideas off of each other. Absolutely. He saw knowledge as a collective endeavor. Not just a bunch of isolated geniuses working in their own little bubbles. And isn't that more relevant than ever today in our hyper-connected world? More than ever. Okay, we've covered a lot of ground already. Philosophy, math, diplomacy, even early computing. But there's one more area we haven't even touched on yet. And it might be the most mind-blowing of all. Oh, and what's that? His ideas about space and time. Time and time. Yeah, like what even is time? What even is space? Big questions. Right. So get ready, because Leibniz was way ahead of his time on this one. He argued that space and time are relative. Relative, wait a minute, are you saying? Way before Einstein. You're kidding. He was thinking about that stuff back then? Oh yeah. He rejected Newton's view, you know, of a fixed, unchanging container for the universe. So instead of space and time as a fixed background, he saw it as what? Leibniz. He saw space and time as a system of relationships between things. Interesting. So like, it's all about perspective. Exactly. Wow, just wow. Right, and you know what? What? This actually ties back to his idea of a universal language for thought. The characteristica universalis. Right. He wanted to create a system of symbols that could represent any concept. Kind of like a, I don't know, a philosophical version of binary code. Exactly. It's like he thought with the right symbolic system, we could calculate the truth of any statement. Ambitious, to say the least. Right. This guy, he was trying to create a system to encompass everything. The entirety of human thought. It's like his brain was a time machine pulling ideas from
