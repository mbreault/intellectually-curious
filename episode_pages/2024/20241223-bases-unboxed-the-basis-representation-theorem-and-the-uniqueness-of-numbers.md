## Description

In this episode, we explore why every positive integer has a unique representation in any base b â€” from decimal to binary to hexadecimal. We build intuition with lego-like imagery, sketch the idea behind a concise induction-style proof of uniqueness, and connect the concept to computing and to alternative number systems like prime or Fibonacci bases. A practical and theoretical tour of a foundational theorem that underpins how we understand and manipulate numbers.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing exploration of number theory. Today we're diving deep into a concept that's pretty fundamental to how we represent numbers. It's called the basis representation theorem. Now you might already be familiar with this from working with binary or hexadecimal systems, but today we're going to go beyond just the surface and really try to explore the why behind it. Yeah, you know what's fascinating about this theorem is that it proves any positive integer can be represented in a unique way using a base b. Think about it, think about it like building with Legos. Okay, so each base is like a different set of bricks and this theorem is telling us there's only one way to build a specific structure with those bricks. Oh, that's a great analogy. So let's try to unpack this using our familiar decimal system, which is base 10, right? The basis representation theorem tells us that. Each number in this system has a unique representation using powers of 10. So for example, the number 123 can be expressed as 1 times 10 to the power of 2 plus 2 times 10 to the power of 1 plus 3 times 10 to the power of 0. And it's this simple representation that allows us to perform calculations so quickly and build upon this system for more complex math. Yeah, and that uniqueness is really crucial. It's what eliminates ambiguity and it forms the basis of our entire number system. I mean, without it, we'd have multiple ways to represent the same number and that would lead to all sorts of confusion and chaos, especially when we start performing operations with those numbers. Now that we've seen it kind of in action, you might be wondering, you know, how do we know this is true for all numbers, though? Well, the proof is presented in ProofWiki. It's pretty elegant. It focuses on demonstrating that if we have a unique representation for a number n, we can also find a unique representation for n1. And this one-to-one correspondence idea is really interesting. Yeah, it allows us to create kind of a chain reaction. So if we know that a unique representation exists for a number, we can confidently say that it also exists for the number before it. And this continues all the way down to the number 1, which has a very clear and unique representation in any base. So it's like a domino effect. We start with a larger number and show that if the theorem holds true for it, it has to be true for the number before it and so on and so on. Exactly. And that process is combined with, you know, with a mathematical tool to link those representations. And it eventually leads us to conclude that the theorem holds true for all positive integers. Okay, that makes sense. Now let's look at an example that's pretty relevant to our digitally driven world, right? Right. Binary or base 2 is the system that computers use with only zeros and ones. Does the basis representation theorem apply here too? Absolutely. Even in this system, the theorem still holds true. Let's take the number 12 as an example. In binary, it's represented as 1100, which translates to 1 times 2 to the power of 3 plus 1 times 2 to the power of 2 plus 0 times 2 to the power of 1 plus 0 times 2 to the power of 0. So this shows us that even in a system as simple as binary, each number still has that unique representation based on the powers of 2. So if computers think in binary, does that mean they see the world in black and white? Uh-huh, just kidding. But speaking of different bases, are there any others we use commonly besides decimal and binary? Definitely. In computer science, you'll often encounter hexadecimal, which is base 16. It uses the digits 0 through 9 and then the letters A through F to represent values from 10 to 15. Oh, so that's why we see those letters mixed in with numbers when we're dealing with computer code. Does the basis representation theorem apply to hexadecimal as well? Absolutely. Any positive integer can be uniquely represented in base 16, for example. The decimal number 255 is represented as FF in hexadecimal, which is 15 times 16 to the power of 1 plus 15 times 16 to the power of 0. It's incredible how a concept we use every day without even thinking about it has such deep mathematical roots. It really makes you appreciate the hidden complexity behind everyday things. This kind of makes you wonder, are we limited to just these bases? What if we used a completely different set of building blocks? That's an excellent question. Mathematicians have explored other number systems, like ones based on prime numbers or Fibonacci sequences. Wow. So while the basis representation theorem is foundational to our current understanding of numbers, there might be entirely different ways to represent and manipulate numbers out there, just waiting to be discovered. Exactly. And those alternative systems could potentially unlock new mathematical insights and possibilities. It really opens up like a whole new perspective on numbers, you know? We've been focusing on the basis representation theorem and how it guarantees that unique representation for every positive integer in a given base. But it sounds like this is really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to number systems. It really is. You know, the basis representation theorem is a fundamental concept, but it's also a springboard for further exploration. You know, it leads to questions like, what are the limits of representation? Or could there be systems where numbers behave in ways we haven't even imagined? Yeah, those are some pretty mind-boggling questions. So what does all this mean for our listeners? Why should they care about the basis representation theorem and these alternative number systems? Well, on a practical level, understanding this theorem gives you a much deeper appreciation for how our current number systems work. From the decimal system we use every day to the binary language that powers our computers, it all comes back to this fundamental principle of unique representation. Yeah, it's like we've been taking these systems for granted and now we're seeing the elegant mathematical machinery behind them. Exactly. And on a more theoretical level, exploring alternative number systems can lead to new mathematical discoveries and potentially even new applications in fields like computer science or cryptography. So we've spent this deep dive exploring the basis representation theorem. It's a cornerstone of number theory. That explains how we represent numbers using these different bases. It might seem like a simple idea at first, but this theorem has some really profound implications for mathematics, computer science, and even our understanding of the nature of numbers themselves. We encourage you to keep exploring. Dive deeper into the proof of the theorem, research those alternative number systems we talked about, and see what other fascinating insights you can uncover in the world of number theory. Who knows, you might even discover a brand new number system yourself.
