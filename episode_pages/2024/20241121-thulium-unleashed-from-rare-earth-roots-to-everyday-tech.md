## Transcript

Ever imagined having a device that could do an x-ray right in your hand? Well, that's the kind of power we're talking about today. We're talking with thulium. Yeah, thulium, an element that's probably not on your radar, but it's seriously shaking things up in the tech world. It is. And today we are diving deep into the world of thulium. Yeah. And we have an expert with us to guide us through it all. Well, thulium is a rare earth element. I mean, it's one of the least abundant in the earth's crust. But I feel like with these elements, rarity doesn't equal boring. Absolutely not. There's some cool stuff going on. Yeah, it's got some seriously cool uses. Yeah, so we're talking lasers. We're talking portable x-ray devices. That's right. And even ways to stop counterfeiting. That's quite a resume. It is quite a resume for this element that most people probably haven't even heard of. Most people are like, who, what? Yeah, exactly. But its properties are what make it so fascinating for all these different applications. Okay. So to understand how, we got to go back. We do. Way back. Back to 1879. To 1879 when, yeah, when Per Teodor Cleve, a Swedish chemist, discovered it. So how did he find this hidden gem of an element? Well, he was working with erbium oxide, trying to get a pure sample, and he ended up discovering not one, but two new elements. What? It's holmium and, of course, thulium. Wow, it's like a two-for-one deal. It is. I'm curious, though, how did he actually separate these elements? Was it like trying to untangle a really, really stubborn knot? Yeah, it was incredibly meticulous. He had to remove all these contaminants from the erbium oxide, which then led him to these two new substances, one of which was thulium oxide. Or thulia. Or thulia, yeah. Now, the name thulium, where does that come from? So he named it after Thule, which was an ancient Greek name associated with Scandinavia. Okay. A fitting tribute, you know. Yeah. Since he was Swedish. But here's where it gets even more interesting. Okay. It took another chemist, Charles James, all the way until 1911 to get a truly pure sample of thulium metal. Okay. And get this, he needed 15,000 purification steps to do it. 15,000 steps. 15,000. Dedication. I know. Yeah. That is some serious dedication to scientific purity. It is. Yeah. Okay, so we know it's rare. It took forever to isolate. Yeah. What does it actually look like? So thulium is a silvery gray metal. Okay. And it has a really beautiful luster when it's freshly cut. Uh-huh. But it tarnishes in air. Oh, okay. Kind of like silver jewelry that needs to be polished regularly. Okay. And it's also fairly soft. You can cut it with a knife. Oh, wow. That's pretty cool. Yeah. So what about its personality? Yeah. Is it reactive? What about its magnetic properties? Well, it does react with oxygen, water, halogens, and acids. It's got a little bit of a temper. Yeah, a little bit. But it's the magnetic properties that are really interesting. You know, rare earths. Yeah. They often have these very unique magnetic properties, and thulium's no exception. Okay. The remarkable thing is how its magnetism changes with temperature. Wait, so it's like a magnetic chameleon? It is. It changes depending on the temperature. Depending on the temperature. Tell me more. So below 32 Kelvin, it's ferromagnetic. Okay. Which means it acts like a typical magnet, you know, like the ones on your refrigerator. Yeah. But between 32 and 56 Kelvin, it becomes antiferromagnetic. Okay. Where the magnetic moments align in opposite directions, and they cancel each other out. Oh, wow. And above 56 Kelvin, it becomes paramagnetic. Okay. Which means it's weakly attracted to a magnetic field. So it's like it has this whole wardrobe of magnetic personalities. It does. It changes its outfit depending on the weather. But speaking of rare, just how rare is this shape-shifting metal? Thulium is the second least abundant lanthanide, right after promethium, which is radioactive. Okay. You won't find it just lying around in its pure form. Right. It's always tucked away in minerals like monazite. Monazite. Xenotime. Okay. And gadolinite. Now, I've heard of monazite. Yeah. Isn't that a source of other rare earth elements that are important for technology? It is, yeah. Monazite is a source of not just thulium, but also cerium and lanthanum, which are used in things like catalysts and magnets. Yeah. So it's a mineral that plays a pretty important role in different technologies. It does. So even though thulium is a minor player in these minerals, it's still part of this bigger picture. Okay. But it has some talents of its own that make it really special. All right, so it's rare. It's got a magnetic personality. Uh-huh. And it hangs out with other rare earths in these minerals. Right. But what are these unique talents that make thulium stand out? Well, its real claim to fame is in lasers. Okay. Specifically, holmium, chromium, thulium, triple-doped YAG lasers. Okay, that's a mouthful. It is. Break that down for us. All right. What's so special about these lasers? These lasers are really efficient. Okay. And they emit light at a very specific wavelength, 2080 nanometers, which is in the infrared spectrum. Okay. And this invisibility is what makes them so useful. Okay. Because this specific wavelength is readily absorbed by water and biological tissues. Interesting. Which makes them ideal for all sorts of things. So they're like stealthy lasers. They are. That can target specific areas with incredible precision. Right. I'm guessing this is why they're used in everything from military targeting systems to medical procedures. Exactly. Okay. So, for instance, in medicine, thulium lasers are perfect for delicate procedures like prostate surgery. Okay. Because the laser energy is absorbed very precisely by the target tissue. Okay. And that minimizes damage to the surrounding areas. Okay. It's like a scalpel. But with pinpoint accuracy. Wow. So from zapping targets to zapping tumors? Yeah. Thulium lasers are the real deal. They are. And speaking of zapping. Yes. Didn't you mention portable x-ray machines earlier? I did. I'm very interested in that. Of course. Because who wouldn't want a portable x-ray device? Right. Yeah. Thulium can also do this amazing thing. It can become a portable x-ray source. Okay. It all starts with thulium-170, which is a radioactive isotope that's produced when you bombard thulium with neutrons. Okay. Thulium-170 has a half-life of 128.6 days. Okay. And it emits gamma rays. So you're taking regular thulium, giving it a little radioactive makeover. Yes. And then using those gamma rays to create x-ray images. Exactly. Okay. Now, it's important to remember thulium itself isn't directly emitting the x-rays. Instead, the gamma rays from the thulium-170 interact with a target material, and that generates the x-rays that are used for imaging. I see. Yeah. Which makes them ideal for field work, you know, disaster relief, even dental offices. And since they use lower energy gamma rays, I'm guessing they require less radiation shielding compared to those bulky machines we see in hospitals? That's one of the biggest advantages. Yeah. The lower energy means you need a much smaller and lighter shield, making them truly portable. This is incredible. Yeah. Thulium is like the Swiss Army knife of elements. It is. Lasers, x-rays, what else can it do? Well, we've only scratched the surface. Okay. It also plays a role in high-temperature superconductors. Hold on. High-temperature superconductors? Yes. The ones that can conduct electricity with zero resistance. That's right. That sounds pretty advanced. It is. I'm assuming thulium is helping these superconductors work at even higher temperatures. You got it. Okay. Thulium, along with other rare earths like yttrium, is being researched to see if it can improve the performance of these superconductors. Okay. And the ultimate goal is to develop superconductors that can operate at more practical temperatures. Right. Which could totally revolutionize how we transmit and store energy. Wow, that would be a game-changer. It would be. Okay, so we got lasers, we got x-rays, potentially revolutionizing our energy grid. Yeah. Is there anything this element can't do? Well... What about ferrites? Yeah. Didn't you mention those earlier? Ferrites are those ceramic magnetic materials that are used in a bunch of applications, including microwave equipment. Okay. And when you dope these materials with thulium, you can enhance their magnetic properties. So it's like thulium's giving them a magnetic boost. It is. This is fascinating. It is. Okay, we've covered lasers, x-rays, superconductors, improving magnetic materials. Yeah. But I have a feeling there's more to this story. There is. Right. You're right. Okay. Thulium also pops up in our daily lives. What? Yeah. For instance, euro banknotes contain thulium as a security measure to prevent
