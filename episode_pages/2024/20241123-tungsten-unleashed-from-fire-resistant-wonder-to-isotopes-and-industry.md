## Transcript

Welcome to our deep dive into the world of tungsten. Tungsten. Yeah, you probably know it from those old school light bulbs. Right. But trust me, this metal is way more interesting than it gets credit for. Oh, absolutely. We're going to be using excerpts from Wikipedia's tungsten entry and an article from nanograppy.com on tungsten's applications to uncover some pretty fascinating facts about this metal. Yeah. So what sparked your interest in tungsten? Getting ready for a presentation or just curious? Whatever the reason, get ready to have your mind blown. Okay. Tungsten really pushes the boundaries of what we consider extreme in material properties. Okay. So before we get into all that, let's start with the basics. Sure. Tungsten, what is it? Well, it's a rare metal symbol, W atomic number 74. Okay. And you almost never find it in its pure form in nature. Really? Instead, you'll find it hanging out with other elements and minerals like wolframite and sheelite. Wolframite. Didn't even know that was a word until I started reading for this deep dive. Apparently its name comes from the German wolfram, which means wolf's soot or wolf cream. Interesting. They called it that because it seemed to devour tin during extraction. Isn't that wild? Talk about a metal with a serious appetite. It really speaks to tungsten's unique chemical interactions even back then. Yeah. And those interactions are key to understanding why tungsten is so sought after. Okay. It boasts the highest melting point of any element. Oh, wow. A scorching 3,422 degrees Celsius. That's 6,192 degrees Fahrenheit. Hot enough to make a rocket scientist sweat. So that's why they use it in rocket nozzles. It all makes sense now. Yeah. It's basically laughing in the face of fire. Pretty much. And speaking of extreme, it's also incredibly dense. Yes, very dense. We're talking denser than lead, almost as dense as uranium and gold. Which is exactly why you see it used in things like ballast weights. Those dense blocks you might find in sailboats or even Formula One race cars. Oh, wow. For stability. But here's the catch. In its most common form, tungsten is actually quite brittle. Wait, hold on. I thought we were talking about a super tough metal. Now it's brittle? It's an important distinction. Okay. The tungsten we usually encounter is polycrystalline. Okay. Meaning it's made up of lots of tiny crystals all jumbled together. I see. But if you could somehow isolate a single, pure tungsten crystal. Now this is where it gets really interesting. Exactly. Okay. Single crystal tungsten is much more ductile. You could actually cut it with a hard steel hacksaw. So it's like this Jekyll and Hyde metal. Kind of. The common form is brittle, but the pure crystal is cuttable. You got it. Mind blown. It's a trip. And it's that combination of strength and density that makes it so useful. For sure. Let's talk about how it's actually used besides rocket nozzles and ballast weights, of course. Well, one of the biggest applications is tungsten carbide or WC. Okay. You're talking incredibly hard and wear resistant. Perfect for things like cutting tools, drill bits, and even the wear resistant coatings on those Formula One engine parts we mentioned earlier. Oh, so that's what gives those race cars their edge. I always just assumed it was all about fancy aerodynamics and high octane fuel. Tungsten plays a crucial role behind the scenes. And it's not just about speed. Think about those mining drills that have to chew through solid rock. Yeah. They often use tungsten carbide bits. It really is a workhorse metal. It is. Oh, I was surprised to learn that it's used in jewelry too. Tungsten rings are apparently all the rage these days, right? They are. They're known for their durability and scratch resistance. Okay. Though there's a bit of a trade-off there. What's that? Resizing them can be a real challenge if, say, you need to adjust for a few extra pounds after the holidays. Okay. Good to know. Note to self, maintain healthy eating habits, especially if sporting a tungsten ring. But tungsten isn't just about brute strength. Right. I was amazed to discover how widely it's used in technology. We already mentioned light bulbs, those classic incandescent ones that are slowly fading away. Yeah. But it's not just about lighting our homes, right? Not at all. Okay. Think X-ray tubes, the electrodes used in TIG welding, even the tiny vibrating motors in your smartphone. Wow. They all rely on tungsten's unique properties. Okay. My brain is officially buzzing with all the ways we use tungsten. But you know what really blew my mind? The fact that this metal used in all this heavy-duty stuff also plays a role in, wait for it, bacteria. It's one of those nature is stranger than fiction moments, isn't it? Totally. So tell me, what's the deal with tungsten and bacteria? Well, certain types of bacteria and archaea actually have enzymes that use tungsten. These enzymes help them do things like break down certain types of molecules. So you're telling me the same metal that helps launch rockets into space is also essential for some tiny life forms? It really highlights tungsten's versatility and the interconnectedness of the elements. Wow. Who would have thought that a metal used in rocket nozzles could also be essential for life? Okay, my mind is officially blown. It happens. Tungsten from light bulbs to bacteria. This metal has a serious resume. But before we get too carried away with tungsten's amazing abilities, I think it's important to address the ethical considerations surrounding its production. Absolutely. We need to take a closer look at the impact of tungsten mining and make sure we're sourcing it responsibly. Stay tuned, everyone, because in part two of our tungsten deep dive, we're going to uncover some of the complexities of tungsten production and what it means for our world. Welcome back to our tungsten deep dive. I'm totally ready. I hope you're ready for more. Yeah. Because we're about to get in some seriously fascinating stuff. We were just talking about how tungsten is used in everything from rocket nozzles to bacteria. Exactly. What's next on our tungsten adventure? Well, we've covered the basics of what tungsten is and what it's used for. Right. But now I want to talk about something a little more nuanced. Okay. Tungsten's isotopes. Isotopes. Okay. Remind me what those are again. Remember how every atom has a nucleus made up of protons and neutrons? Yeah. Well, isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. Right, right. I remember learning about that in chemistry class a long, long time ago. But what's interesting about tungsten is that it has five naturally occurring isotopes. Five. Four of them are stable. Okay. Tungsten-182, 183, 184, and 186. Got it. But then there's tungsten-180. Okay. It's technically radioactive, but its half-life is so incredibly long. Really? That it's considered practically stable. Hold on. A half-life so long it's practically stable? How long are we talking about here? Get this, 1.8 by 10 to the 18th power years. Wow. That's longer than the entire age of the universe. So while it could theoretically decay. Right. It's essentially sticking around for the long haul. Exactly. And all five of these isotopes could theoretically decay into isotopes of hafnium, the element two spots below tungsten on the periodic table. Right. Through a process called alpha decay. Uh-huh. But guess what? We've only ever observed tungsten-180 actually decaying. The others, they're just hanging out being stable. So they're like those friends who never seem to age. Forever young. That's a great analogy. Thanks. And it's not just the naturally occurring isotopes that are fascinating. What else? Scientists have also created over 30 artificial radioisotopes of tungsten in labs. Artificial isotopes so they don't exist in nature? Nope. They're made by bombarding tungsten atoms with particles in a particle accelerator. Interesting. These artificial isotopes are much less stable. Okay. Which means they decay more quickly, releasing radiation in the process. So they're kind of like the wild child siblings of the stable isotope. I like that. But don't underestimate their importance. Okay. These artificial radioisotopes have a variety of uses in medical imaging, cancer treatments, and even industrial applications like tracing the flow of materials. Okay. I'm starting to see how isotopes, both natural and artificial, can be incredibly useful tools. They really are. Yeah. And it's not just about their stability or radioactivity. The subtle differences in their masses can actually be used to study all sorts of things. Like what? For example, scientists use variations in tungsten isotopes found in rocks to understand how different geological formations were created. Wow. So we're talking about using isotopes to trace the history of the Earth itself. That's some serious detective work. It is. And it gets even cooler. Oh. Because tungsten is so resistant to weathering and erosion. Yeah. Its isotopes can be used to track the movement of sediments in rivers and oceans. Interesting. Helping us understand how landscapes evolve over time. Okay. My mind is officially blown again. Tungsten isotopes, who knew they were so versatile? But before we dive too deep into geology, let's bring it back to tungsten itself. Sure. What can you tell me about its chemical behavior? Well, one of the most interesting things about tungsten is its wide range of oxidation states. Oxidation states, that's about how many electrons an atom has gained or lost, right? Exactly. And tungsten can have oxidation states ranging from negative two all the way up to plus six. Wow. That's a huge range. So it's kind of like tungsten can wear many hats
