## Description

We explore A00024, the sequence counting how many integers can be written as x^2 + 10y^2 within ranges up to 2^n. We trace its connection to the population of a quadratic form, Landau's theorem, and the work of Shanks and Schmid, then examine the PARI code provided in the OEIS entry to generate the sequence yourself.

## Transcript

All right. So are you ready to dive in? Oh, absolutely. Let's get into it. Always excited to explore some new number sequences. I love it when you say that because you know that's where we're going today. Oh, excellent. Deep dive into the world of numbers. Specifically, I think this one is called A00024. I don't know. It's a mouthful. Yeah, it's a mouthful. But that's the OEIS way, right? They have their numbering system. That'll have OEIS. Absolutely. For those who aren't familiar, that's the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. And that's like a massive database of all sorts of just fascinating, beautiful number sequences. People from all over the world contribute to this. Yeah. It's a treasure trove for anyone who is even remotely interested in patterns and numbers. Or even if you're not. I'm not going to say I'm a math whiz or anything. But you look at these and it's just cool to see how these numbers play together. It's hypnotic in a way, right? Just seeing these patterns. It is. It is hypnotic. So A00024, this one is generated by the formula x squared plus 10y squared. I'm not going to pretend to know exactly what that means. I mean, I know x squared, you know, it's some number of times itself. But basically it's looking at integers. Let me see if I can get this right. Positive integers less than or equal to 2 to the n. Yes. That can be expressed in the form x squared plus 10y squared. The sequence starts like this. 1, 1, 2, 2, 7, 10, 20, 36. And then it just explodes from there. But I know that you love this kind of stuff. I do. I do. And this particular quadratic form, x squared plus 10y squared, it has some fascinating properties. Really? Yeah. One of the things that mathematicians look at is something called the population of a quadratic form. Population of a quadratic form. It's basically a measure of how many different integers you can represent using that specific formula. So you can imagine each quadratic form as, as you said, like a container. And we're trying to figure out how many numbers fit nicely into it. Okay. And what this A00024 sequence is doing, it's giving us a glimpse into the population of this x squared plus 10y squared within these specific ranges defined by powers of 2. I see. I see. So it's kind of like a census, right? We're looking at all of these numbers and we're saying, okay, how many of you guys fit into this formula? Yeah. And that's the population of that formula. Exactly. Exactly. It's like a census for these mathematical objects. That is so cool. I love that analogy. And, you know, speaking of, you know, people who have looked at this, the OEIS entry mentions a couple of math heavy hitters, right? Dee Shanks and L.P. Schmid. Oh, yes. And their work, variations on a theorem of Landau. And Landau, I mean, those are names that come up a lot when you talk about number theory, right? Absolutely. These are giants in the field of number theory. And their work has had a profound impact on our understanding of numbers and their properties. Now, to really appreciate what Shanks and Schmid were doing, we need to touch upon Landau's theorem. Okay. Now, Landau's theorem deals with the distribution of prime numbers, which are the building blocks of all numbers, you know, the numbers that are only divisible by one and themselves. And what Landau's theorem essentially does, it provides a kind of map, a map of how these prime numbers are distributed amongst all the other numbers. It's a deep result with far-reaching consequences. So it's almost like a blueprint for how numbers work. Like if you can understand the prime numbers and how they're distributed, you can unlock a lot of the secrets of the universe, so to speak, of the number universe. Exactly. Exactly. And what Shanks and Schmid were doing in their work, variations on a theorem of Landau, they were exploring different aspects of this map. They were creating variations, sort of like looking at the map from different angles, using different lenses. And A00024, our sequence, it played a part in their investigations. Wow. I mean, that is just, it's blowing my mind how much depth there is to this. You know, you start off with just a simple sequence of numbers, and then it just opens up into this whole world of research and exploration. It's like a rabbit hole, right? You go deeper and deeper and you just find more and more connections. Exactly. Exactly. It's like, you know, you think you're just looking at a little tiny flower, but then you realize that it's connected to this whole, you know, ecosystem. Exactly. And the OEIS is fantastic in that way, right? Because it allows you to jump into this rabbit hole. Absolutely. And speaking of jumping into the rabbit hole, the OEIS entry, it even gives you the code. Like if you wanted to, you could actually generate this sequence yourself. Absolutely. In the pre-oag section, they actually provide you with a piece of code written in PARI, which is a language that mathematicians often use for number theory calculations. So it's not just like a passive thing where you just read about it. You can actually, you know, get your hands dirty and play with these numbers. Yeah. It's almost like giving you the ingredients and saying, okay, here's how you can cook up this mathematical dish. Exactly. Exactly. That's what's so amazing about OEIS. It's not just for, you know, the hardcore mathematicians. It's for anyone who's curious. And it's constantly growing and evolving as more and more people contribute their findings and their sequences. Absolutely. Absolutely. And if you look a little further down in the OEIS entry, you'll see something called index entries for sequences related to populations of quadratic forms. I mean, there's so much more to discover here. It's just, it's mind boggling. It's the tip of the iceberg, right? We've talked about this specific sequence, but it's part of a much larger web, a network of sequences all related to this idea of quadratic forms and their populations. So basically what we've done is we've kind of peeled back a little bit of the curtain, you know, on this world of number theory. Yeah. We've opened a door and it's up to the listener to decide how far they want to go in exploring these amazing patterns. Exactly. Exactly. But I think the big takeaway here is that this isn't just, you know, some abstract math game. This stuff actually has real world applications. Oh, absolutely. I mean, the field of cryptography, for example, which is essential for secure online communications, it relies heavily on the properties of prime numbers and understanding their distribution. Look, we talked about with Landau's theorem, it's crucial in designing those secure algorithms that protect our data and our privacy online. So basically every time we, you know, send an email or make an online purchase, we're benefiting from the work of mathematicians who have, you know, dug deep into these number theory concepts. It's kind of mind blowing when you think about it. It is. It is. It's a testament to the power of abstract thinking, right? That these ideas that seem so theoretical can have such a profound impact on our daily lives. It's like that quote, I don't know who said it, but it's like mathematics is the language in which God wrote the universe. Beautiful. I love that. Something like that, right? And I think that's, yeah, that's what we've kind of glimpsed here today is that, you know, these number sequences, they're not just, you know, random numbers. They're patterns that reveal something deeper about the underlying structure of the universe. Absolutely. And as 00024, with its connection to quadratic forms and prime number distribution, it's a beautiful example of that. It's a window into a world of mathematical beauty and complexity. I totally agree. And who knows what other secrets are hidden within the vast library of OEIS just waiting to be discovered. That's the exciting part, right? The journey of exploration never ends. It really doesn't. Well, thanks for joining me on this deep dive. It was a pleasure as always. Until next time. See you then. Keep exploring those number sequences. You never know what you might find. Exactly. You never know.
