## Description

We peel back the layers of A000065, the â€˜minus one plus the number of partitionsâ€™ sequence, and watch it thread through geometry, graph theory, and even real-world systems. Weâ€™ll explore its geometric side: counting n-dimensional simplices with integer edge lengths and a fixed diameter, revealing how partitions shape the simplest building blocks of space. In graph theory, weâ€™ll examine graphs with tree width n^2 and their near-tree-like structure, and how rooted trees of height two connect to algorithmic questions in data organization. The story extends to networks and supply chains: a 2013 Modrakâ€“Martin framework uses A000065 to quantify topology complexity, offering a bridge from abstract partitions to real-world resilience and design. Weâ€™ll also touch on partitions viewed through alternative lensesâ€”sums plus parts constraintsâ€”and finally glimpse a striking property of the complements of those near-tree graphs: a forbidden-substructure flavor that exposes an elegant, layered structure beneath the complexity. Join us as we uncover how this simple sequence quietly orchestrates a surprising chorus across mathematics and beyond.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into the OEIS. Today we're diving into sequence A000065. It might seem deceptively simple at first. It represents minus one plus the number of partitions of an integer. But as we'll discover, this sequence has its fingers in a surprising number of mathematical pies. What's so fascinating about A000065 is that it acts as a bridge between seemingly disparate areas of mathematics. We'll see how it connects to geometry, graph theory, and even offers insights into the structure of real-world systems like supply chains. Supply chains? That's not what I expected to encounter in a sequence about partitions. Let's start with something a little closer to home, like the geometry connection. What can you tell us about that? One of the first places A000065 pops up is in the world of simplices. Simplices? These are the simplest possible shapes in any given dimension. Think of a triangle in two dimensions, a tetrahedron in three. Our sequence tells us that A of n plus 1 gives you the number of different n-dimensional simplices you can create with sides of integer length and a diameter of n. Okay, I'm going to need a little more on that. Sure. When you say diameter of a simplex, what exactly do you mean? Imagine you have a tetrahedron, a three-dimensional simplex. The diameter is the longest distance between any two points on that tetrahedron. I see. So our sequence is essentially counting how many unique tetrahedra you can build with whole number side lengths and a fixed diameter. So it's not just about how many ways you can break down a number, but also about how those parts can be used to construct these fundamental geometric shapes. That's pretty neat. Exactly. And it highlights how this sequence is about more than just counting partitions. It's about understanding the structures that can be built from those partitions. Let's move on to graph theory. Okay. I know graphs can be used to represent all sorts of things, so I'm curious to see how A000065 fits into that picture. This is where things start to get really interesting. A000065 also describes the number of graphs with n vertices and a tree width of n2. Okay. Now tree width is a way to measure how tree-like a graph is. So a low tree width means the graph is very similar to a tree structure. Precisely. A tree width of n2 means our graphs are almost trees, but with a touch more complexity. Interesting. So A000065 isn't just counting simple tree structures. It's also counting the number of graphs that have this slightly more intricate structure. It sounds like this sequence is revealing a kind of hidden order in the world of graphs. That's a great way to put it. Yeah. And this idea of hidden order becomes even more apparent when we look at how A000065 relates to supply chains. Now that's a connection I'm really curious about. Yeah. How can a sequence about partitions tell us anything about the complexity of supply chains? Think of it this way. Okay. Any complex system, like a supply chain, can be broken down into interconnected subsystems. The way these subsystems are linked together, what we call their topology, can have a huge impact on things like efficiency and resilience. Makes sense. In a 2013 paper, researchers Modrak and Martin used A000065 to create a scale for measuring the complexity of these supply chain topologies. So the way we partition a number can somehow reflect the way a supply chain is organized. Can you give us a more concrete sense of how that works? Imagine a simple supply chain with just a few linear steps. That would correspond to a partition with very few parts. Right. Now imagine a highly interconnected supply chain with multiple suppliers, manufacturers, and distribution channels. That would correspond to a partition with many parts. I see. Reflecting the higher level of complexity. Okay. What Modrak and Martin did was to use the properties of A000065 to develop a mathematical framework for analyzing these different levels of complexity. So this seemingly abstract sequence about partitions gives us a tool for understanding and quantifying the complexity of real-world systems. Exactly. And what's truly remarkable is that this is just one of many connections that A000065 has to other areas of mathematics. We haven't even touched on its relationship to rooted trees or certain types of differential equations. We've definitely only scratched the surface here. Right. But I think this is a good place to pause for now. Sounds good. Listeners, stay with us as we continue our deep dive into the surprising world of A000065 in our next segment. Okay. We've seen how A000006 connects to geometry and graphs and even has implications for understanding supply chain complexity. Right. What other mathematical landscapes does this sequence touch upon? Let's delve into the realm of rooted trees. Rooted trees. Structures used extensively in computer science and other fields to represent hierarchical data. Okay. Interestingly, A000065 emerges here as well. You mentioned rooted trees are used for hierarchical data. Yeah. Could you give us a quick refresher on what that means exactly? Imagine a family tree, but instead of people, we have data points. Right. The root is at the top and all other data points branch out downwards. Okay. This hierarchical structure is crucial for organizing and searching information efficiently. So how does our sequence A000065 come into play with these rooted trees? The connection lies in the specific structure of these trees. Okay. A000065 in this context represents the number of rooted trees you can create with n plus one nodes where the height of the tree is exactly two. When you say height of two, you're referring to the number of levels in the tree? Yes. Okay. A height of two means we have the root node at the top, one layer of nodes directly below it, and then the leaves, the final nodes at the bottom. So A000065 is telling us how many ways we can arrange those nodes within this specific two-layer tree structure. Right. But why is that significant? Why focus on a height of two? It might seem like a specific constraint, but trees of height two are actually quite fundamental. Okay. They represent a basic building block for more complex trees. I see. Understanding how many variations exist at this foundational level helps us understand the potential complexity of larger tree structures. That makes sense. Yeah. By studying the simple cases, we can gain insights into the more complex ones. Exactly. I can see how this would be relevant in computer science. Especially when designing algorithms that rely on tree structures. Absolutely. Yeah. The efficiency of many algorithms depends on the specific shape and arrangement of the tree they operate on. Right. A000065, by quantifying the number of possible tree structures, gives us a glimpse into the potential variations and complexities that algorithms might have to handle. It's amazing how this seemingly simple sequence keeps revealing connections to such diverse fields. It is. We've gone from geometry to graphs to supply chains and now rooted trees, all linked by A000065. Yeah. Is there an end to the reach of this sequence? The beauty of mathematics is that the exploration never truly ends. Right. There's always another layer to uncover, another connection to discover. And speaking of uncovering, there's another fascinating facet of A000065 that I think you'll find intriguing. Interesting. It involves revisiting partitions but looking at them through a slightly different lens. Okay. I'm ready for another perspective on partitions. All right. What's this new angle? Instead of just looking at the individual parts of a partition, we're going to consider the sum of those parts in relation to the number of parts itself. Okay. Interestingly, A000065 also represents the number of partitions where the sum of the parts plus the number of parts is less than or equal to n. So it's like we're adding an extra constraint based on both the total value and the way we've divided it. Exactly. It's a subtle shift in perspective, but it leads us right back to A000065, demonstrating yet again how deeply embedded this sequence is within the fabric of number theory. It really feels like we're uncovering a hidden thread that connects all these diverse areas of mathematics. Yeah. It makes me wonder what other secrets does A000065 hold? There are always more insights to be gleaned, but I think it's time we turn our attention to one final connection. Okay. One that brings us back to the world of graphs and tree width. Remember our discussion about graphs with a tree width of n2? Yes. Well, there's a hidden structural property linked to those graphs that's directly connected to A000065. I'm all ears. Okay. What is this hidden property? To understand it, we need to talk about the complement of a graph. Okay. Imagine taking a graph and flipping all its connections. If two vertices were connected in the original graph, they're no longer connected in the complement and vice versa. Right. It turns out that the complements of graphs with a tree width of n2 have a very specific and elegant structure. Interesting. But I think that's a conversation best left for our final segment. Okay. I'm already intrigued. Listeners, stay tuned as we wrap up our deep dive into A000065 and unveil the final piece of this mathematical puzzle. We've journeyed through the world of A000065, exploring its connections to geometry, graph theory, supply chains, and even rooted trees. It's quite a journey. You've left me hanging with this intriguing mention of a hidden structural property in the complements of certain graphs. I'm ready to unveil that final piece of the puzzle. All right. Let's rewind to our discussion about graphs with a tree width of n2. Okay. Remember, these graphs are almost tree-like, but with a touch more complexity. Now when we look at their complements, those graphs where the connections are flips, a beautiful pattern emerges. You mentioned that these complements have a specific structure. Can you elaborate on that? Absolutely. The complements of graphs with a tree width of n2 cannot contain certain common graph structures. For example, they can't have paths of
