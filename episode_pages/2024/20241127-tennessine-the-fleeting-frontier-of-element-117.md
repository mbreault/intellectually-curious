## Transcript

Welcome to another deep dive. Today we're going to be delving into the world of tennessine, element 117. And we'll be using excerpts from its Wikipedia page to kind of peel back the layers and see what we can learn about this recently discovered element. And I think it's safe to say that it's captured the imaginations of scientists worldwide for good reason. Oh, absolutely. I think what's really captivating about tennessine is that it's completely synthetic. Oh, really? So you won't find it occurring naturally. Anywhere it has to be created in a lab. And even then, it only exists for milliseconds. Milliseconds. Yeah, it really pushes the boundaries of what we know about the structure of matter. So milliseconds, that's barely even enough time to blink. Yeah. How did scientists even discover tennessine if it disappears so quickly? And then how did they even confirm that it was real? Yeah, well, it all started with this ambitious plan to smash atoms together. Okay. Specifically, nuclei of berkelium and calcium using a particle accelerator. And the hope was that if they collided at just the right speed, they'd fuse and form element 117. So it's kind of like a subatomic game of billiards. Exactly. With much higher stakes, though. Much higher stakes, yeah. But here's where the story takes a fascinating turn. Oh? This wasn't just a scientific challenge. It was also a logistical one. Okay. The experiment required a berkelium target. And the only place producing it at the time was Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US. Oh, wow. But they had temporarily stopped production, and restarting it was considered too expensive. So the fate of this groundbreaking experiment rested on budgeting. That's not what I was expecting. It's a reminder that cutting-edge science often hinges on factors beyond the lab. Yeah. But a dedicated physicist at Vanderbilt University, Joseph Hamilton, who was collaborating with the Russian team, refused to give up. He kept tabs on the situation. And in 2008, his persistence paid off. Oak Ridge resumed californium production, which meant berkelium could be extracted as a byproduct. So Hamilton seized the opportunity and secured the much-needed berkelium. That's incredible. I can only imagine the pressure of transporting a highly radioactive, super-rare element across continents. Was it smooth sailing? Not quite. The berkelium had a short shelf life, so to speak, because of its decay rate. They had to fly it to Russia. And the shipment actually got held up in customs multiple times. What? Imagine the stress. A multimillion-dollar experiment hanging in the balance because of paperwork. That's a scientist's nightmare. I know. But it eventually made it right. It did. Otherwise, we wouldn't be talking about tennessine. Exactly. It finally arrived at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, or JINR, in Russia in 2009. And that's when the real work began. Okay. They bombarded the berkelium target with calcium ions using their particle accelerator. Wow. And months later, in early 2010, they announced signs of element 117. That's amazing. But I imagine signs of an element don't automatically qualify as a confirmed discovery, especially with something as fleeting as tennessine. How did they prove that it was really real? Yeah, you're absolutely right. Detecting hints of a new element and confirming its existence are two very different things. Yeah. They had to meticulously analyze the decay chain, basically track how the tennessine atoms broke down into other elements. So they're piecing together this element's existence based on how it falls apart. Yeah. That's wild. Yeah, but here's the catch. Okay. All the daughter isotopes, the products of tennessine's decay, were also new to science. Oh, wow. So their properties couldn't be used to confirm the initial observation. Talk about a scientific puzzle. Right. It took a few more years to really solidify their findings. So the scientific community needed more concrete evidence before declaring victory. Precisely. The key piece arrived in 2011 when one of the decay products, element 115, was directly synthesized. Okay. And guess what? Its properties perfectly matched those observed in the earlier experiment with tennessine. Oh, wow. It was the confirmation they needed. So it's like a domino effect. Yeah. Creating and confirming one super heavy element helps pave the way for confirming others. Absolutely. And the story doesn't end there. Oh, there's more. The JINR team repeated the experiment in 2012, creating even more tennessine atoms. And then a joint German-American team confirmed the findings independently in 2014. Okay. So we've got multiple teams, different methods, all pointing to the same conclusion. Tennessine is real. Yes. And in 2015, IUPAC and IUPAP, the bigwigs of chemistry, officially recognized the discovery. Yes. And can we just appreciate the name, tennessine? Yeah. It's not every day a new element gets named after a region honoring the place and the incredible research institutions that made the discovery possible. It's a reminder that scientific breakthroughs often involve international collaboration and a fair bit of persistence. Absolutely. Okay, so we know it exists, but what do we actually know about tennessine? That's where I imagine things get really interesting. So tell me more. Well, tennessine sits right below astatine on the periodic table in group 17, the halogen group. Okay. So you'd think it would act a lot like its lighter siblings, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, etc. Right. But that's where things get really fascinating. Okay. Tennessine has a few surprises up its sleeve. Let me guess. It doesn't quite follow the halogen playbook. You got it. Well, it's predicted to be a metal. Okay. Unlike the non-metals above it, it's also expected to be far less reactive than a typical halogen. So it's a metal that doesn't quite act like a metal. Yeah. And a halogen that's not so eager to react. I'm sensing a theme here. Yeah. Tennessine likes to keep us on our toes. It really does. And the reason for all this rule-breaking comes down to something called relativistic effects. Relativity in chemistry. Okay, that's not something you hear every day. I know, right? But think about it. The electrons in super-heavy elements like tennessine are whizzing around the nucleus at incredible speeds. Approaching the speed of light. Wow. And all that high-speed motion actually impacts the element's properties. So are these speedy electrons like the flash of the periodic table bending the rules of chemistry as we know them? That's a great way to put it. I like that. One of the major relativistic effects is the splitting of electron energy levels. Okay. It's like those electrons are being sorted into different energy lanes, if you will. And this directly affects how tennessine bonds with other elements. I'm starting to see why scientists find tennessine so captivating. It's a glimpse into a realm where relativity and chemistry collide. What other quirks does it have? Well, for one, while tennessine is predicted to have several possible oxidation states or charges, the max one state, which is common for halogens, is expected to be rare for tennessine. Wait, so if it's not so keen on gaining an electron, does that even mean it's a halogen? How do we classify something like that? That's a question that has sparked a lot of discussion in the scientific community. It challenges our traditional understanding of how elements behave and how we categorize them. It really blurs the lines. Fascinating. So how does tennessine form bonds if it's not following the usual halogen script? Well, it can still form covalent bonds, where electrons are shared between atoms. Okay. For example, two tennessine atoms are predicted to bond together, forming a diatomic molecule, TS2. Okay. It's also predicted to bond with chlorine, creating tennessine chloride, or TSCL. Okay, so it can bond, but those are just two examples. What other predictions have scientists made about tennessine's bonding behavior? This is where I imagine those relativistic effects really come into play. You're right, they do. One prediction is that tennessine monohydride, or TSH, the simplest compound it can form with hydrogen, will have a longer bond length and a weaker dissociation energy compared to other halogen hydrides. It all comes down to those relativistic effects influencing how tennessine's electrons interact. So even in its simplest compounds, tennessine is already showcasing its unique character. It's amazing how these tiny, super-fast electrons can have such a huge impact on how an element behaves. Absolutely. And the differences don't stop. Scientists have also predicted the dipole moments, a measure of how charge is distributed in a molecule for molecules like TLTs and NHTs, which are compounds formed with thallium and nihonium, respectively. These predictions show that relativistic effects can even flip the polarity of a bond with a negative charge residing on the tennessine atom in one case and the other element in another. Wow, it really seems like tennessine is constantly rewriting the rules of chemistry. You said it, and here's another prediction that truly underscores this element's rebellious nature. Remember how we talked about those electron energy level splits? Yeah. Well, they're so pronounced in tennessine that they actually influence the shape of its molecules. Okay, now I definitely need a visual. How can electron energy levels affect the shape of a molecule? Imagine the molecule TSF3 tennessine trifluoride. Okay. Based on what we know about other halogen trifluorides, we'd expect it to have a bent T shape. Okay. But the predictions show that due to those strong relativistic effects
