## Transcript

Welcome back. You know how much we love diving deep into number theory. Oh, absolutely. Always fascinating. Well, today we're taking on something that connects the abstract world of numbers with some pretty practical stuff. The Kelly Criterion. The Kelly Criterion. Interesting. Yeah, you might be surprised to hear that a formula from probability theory can actually help us figure out how much to bet on something or even how much to invest. Now that's what I call applied mathematics. Exactly. We'll be using excerpts from the Wikipedia article on the Kelly Criterion, so let's dive in. Sounds good. Okay, so first things first. What exactly is the Kelly Criterion? How does it work? At its core, the Kelly Criterion is a formula for figuring out the optimal bet size or investment size. Optimal in terms... Optimal for maximizing the long-term growth of your capital, of course. Okay, so it's about making your money grow over time. Exactly. And it takes into account the probability of winning or losing, and of course the potential payoff, finding that sweet spot between risk and reward, you know? So it's not just about how likely you are to win, but also how much you could win or lose. You got it. So let's start with a simple scenario, a gamble with a binary outcome. Like a coin toss. Yeah, like a coin toss. Or a sports bet, something like that. Okay, I'm following. So the basic Kelly formula tells you what fraction of your bankroll to wager based on the probability of winning and losing. Makes sense. And also how much you stand to gain if you win. Okay, so let's say I'm at the racetrack. I think a certain horse is going to win. Right. The Kelly Criterion could help me figure out how much to bet. Precisely. But here's where it gets interesting. The Kelly Criterion would actually recommend betting nothing if the odds are perfectly even. Really? So like with a fair coin toss? Yep. It basically recognizes that without an edge, you're just introducing unnecessary risk. Oh, I see. Why risk it if there's no advantage? That's the idea. And what's even more fascinating is that it suggests taking the opposite side of the bet if the edge is negative. So if the odds are stacked against me. Exactly. Kelly would actually advise betting against the outcome you think is more likely. Wow, that's kind of counterintuitive. It might seem that way, but it makes sense in the context of long-term gains. So it's all about playing the odds strategically. You got it. Now, when we move beyond simple gambles, there's a more general Kelly formula that accounts for partial losses. Partial losses. Right, so this makes it relevant for things like investments where outcomes aren't always win or lose. So instead of just betting on a single outcome, it's more like how much of my portfolio to allocate to a certain stock. Yeah, exactly. This version factors in things like the fraction of assets to invest, the probability of the investment going up or down in value, and, you know, the potential gains or losses. So while the basic principle maximizing growth remains the same, the application gets more nuanced when we talk about investing. Right, and it's important to remember that the Kelly criterion depends on youing the probabilities accurately. That makes sense. Which is obviously much harder in real-world investments. Than, like, with, say, a coin toss. Of course. But even with that limitation, it gives us valuable insights into managing risk and optimizing returns. I think this would be a great time to talk about that study mentioned in the Wikipedia article. You know, where participants were given $25 to bet on a biased coin. Oh, yeah, that's a classic example. The coin landed on heads 60% of the time. Right. And they had a limited amount of time to make bets. What's so interesting is that most people didn't bet optimally. It's true, they didn't. They also had a limit on their winnings, kind of mimicking real-world constraints. Makes sense. According to Kelly, they should bet 20% of their bankroll on each toss. That would lead to much higher average gains over time. Wow, 20% each time. Yep. But get this, even with the limit on winnings, a slightly modified Kelly strategy still beat most participants. So even with real-world restrictions, Kelly could still make a big difference. But how does this formula actually work? We know it involves maximizing the expected value of the logarithm of wealth. Right, the logarithm. But what does that mean in plain English? Well, that's where logarithms and their relationship to growth come in. Okay, so by focusing on the logarithm of wealth, the Kelly criterion is emphasizing sustainable growth over time. Exactly. It's not about risky bets that could lead to big losses, but a more consistent approach. So minimizing risk while still aiming for growth. Got it. Exactly. And the beauty of the Kelly criterion is that it can be applied to situations beyond simple binary outcomes. So not just coin tosses. Right. Think about a horse race with multiple horses or investing in the stock market. Wow, that's pretty powerful. But before we get into those more complex scenarios, I want to make sure I understand the key takeaways so far. Would you say that at its core, the Kelly criterion is about finding that sweet spot between risk and reward, guided by a deep understanding of probabilities? Absolutely. It also highlights the importance of having an edge in your bets or investments, calculating it accurately, and then betting proportionally to maximize long-term growth. And sometimes that means going against our intuition. You know it. Sometimes the most counterintuitive strategies lead to the best results. I find it fascinating that these principles, derived from number theory, can be applied not only to gambling, but also to complex investment decisions. And that's exactly where we'll pick up in the next part of our deep dive. I can't wait. So we've talked about the Kelly criterion in some pretty straightforward situations, but how does it work in more complex scenarios like, say, a horse race with lots of contenders? Or investing in a diverse portfolio. Those are great questions. Let's tackle the horse race first. Instead of just win or lose, we've got multiple possible outcomes, each with its own odds. Right, and that's where the Kelly criterion really shines. We need to determine the expected revenue rate for each horse. Revenue rate. So we're not just looking at who's most likely to win. Exactly. We have to consider the probability of each horse winning and the potential payout. The Kelly criterion helps us identify the horses with the highest expected revenue rates. Those are the ones we want to focus on. So it's about finding the horses where the reward, considering the odds, offers the best long-term value. You got it. And here's where Kelly gets even more interesting. It helps us figure out how much to bet on each of those horses. So it's not just about picking the right horses, but also about spreading your bets strategically. Exactly. Optimizing your betting strategy across all the horses you've chosen. A mathematical system for spreading risk, guided by the principle of maximizing long-term growth. You said it perfectly, and this same principle translates directly to the stock market. Imagine each stock as a horse in the race. Each with its own expected return and risk level. Right, so instead of horses, you have different stocks or assets, each with its own potential. So could the Kelly criterion help me decide how to split my investments across different stocks? Absolutely. By considering the expected returns and the risks of each asset, Kelly can guide you toward an optimal allocation strategy for long-term growth. Now I'm curious, is this something people actually use in the real world? Or is it mainly theoretical? That's a great question. While it's hard to say for sure how widely it's used, there's evidence suggesting some very successful investors have incorporated Kelly-like methods. No way. Like who? Well, there's speculation that people like Warren Buffett and Bill Gross have used strategies that resemble Kelly's principles. Wow, so even those titans of finance might be drawing from number theory. That's amazing. It's definitely possible. But it's important to remember, the Kelly criterion is a tool, not a magic crystal ball. Right, it can't predict the future. Exactly. It relies on accurate estimations of probabilities and payoffs, which can be tough to figure out in the real world of finance. So it's about making informed decisions, not guaranteeing success. Well said. Even with careful analysis, there's always uncertainty in markets. That's why it's often smart to bet or invest a bit less than the Kelly criterion suggests. Kind of like a safety net. Exactly. Balancing the desire for growth with the need to manage risk. Especially in environments as complex as the stock market. You're right, things change so quickly. Speaking of change, you mentioned earlier that real-world scenarios often don't have those neat, predictable probabilities that the classic Kelly criterion assumes. Exactly. In the stock market, for instance, probabilities are in constant flux. So how can we apply Kelly when we're dealing with incomplete information? You know, when probabilities are always shifting? That's the million-dollar question. And it leads us to some really interesting areas of research, which we'll dig into after a quick recap of our discussion. So we've covered a lot of ground with the Kelly criterion, from simple bets to investing strategies. But before we wrap up, I want to circle back to that challenge you brought up. You know, how do we actually use Kelly in situations where information is incomplete or those probabilities are always changing? Right, because the real world is messy. It's not always like a coin toss with clear odds. That's a crucial question. And it really pushes us to think about how we can apply mathematical models to systems like the stock market, where things are dynamic and unpredictable. One approach researchers are exploring is incorporating the idea of uncertainty directly into the Kelly formula. Uncertainty. Yeah, so instead of assuming we know the exact probabilities, we acknowledge a range of possibilities and
