## Transcript

Welcome back to our OEIS deep dive. Today we're going to be tackling A000087, which is a sequence that combines graph theory and topology. It has to do with counting unrooted, non-separable planar maps with dinah edges and a distinguished face. Okay, so if you had a map of the subway lines, the stations would be the vertices, the tracks would be the edges, and the neighborhoods they enclose would be the faces. Yeah, exactly like that. Okay, gotcha. And then, so non-separable, what does that mean? Non-separable just means that you can't cut the map into two separate pieces by snipping just one edge. So it has to be well-connected? Yeah, think of it like a network with no single point of failure. Okay. Gotcha. Yeah. And then what's this distinguished face? Distinguished face is just one specific face that we choose to highlight. So you could think about it as picking out a particular neighborhood on your map. So we're counting these well-connected networks on a flat surface with a highlighted region. Yeah. Why are we counting this? What's so special about this? Well, these maps actually have surprising applications in different fields. For instance, in computer science, understanding network connectivity is super crucial. And these maps provide a model for analyzing just that. So imagine you're designing like a robust communication network. These maps can help you understand its vulnerabilities and optimize its structure. Yeah, that makes sense. Like I could see how that would be useful outside of just pure math theory. It actually goes even further than that. These maps are also used in physics to model 2D quantum gravity. Wow. And they also pop up in the study of permutation patterns, which are basically just specific arrangements of numbers. It might seem totally unrelated, but it just shows the interconnectedness of different mathematical concepts. So this is like a pretty fundamental structure that we're looking at. Yeah, precise. With connections to a lot of different areas. And recent research has uncovered this fascinating connection between these maps and a special kind of tree. Trees? Like with branches and leaves? Well, not quite those kind of trees, but the concept is similar. So these are called beta-1 trees, and they have specific rules about their structure and labeling. And it turns out there's this one-to-one correspondence between these trees and the non-separable planar maps that we're discussing. So like for every map, there's a unique tree that represents it. Exactly. Or vice versa. Exactly. So this connection lets us study the maps through the lens of trees, which can be a little bit easier to analyze in some ways. It's kind of like having a new set of tools to understand these complex structures. So how does that connection actually work? Like, can you give me an example? Absolutely. So let's talk about two faces. These are regions in the map that are bounded by only two edges. So like think of it like a narrow alleyway on your map. It turns out that the number of these two faces in a map can be determined simply by looking at the labels of certain nodes in the corresponding beta-1 tree. Wow. So you can actually analyze the tree and learn something about the map's structure. Exactly. That's really powerful. Yeah. And it gets even more intriguing when we delve into specific types of maps, like primitive maps. Primitive maps. What are those? So those are a special subset of non-separable planar maps where almost all the faces except for one specific one are not two faces. So think of them like the simplest building blocks for constructing more complex maps. Of like the atoms. Yeah, exactly. Of non-separable planar maps. Uh-huh. Gotcha. So how do they fit into the picture with the trees? Yeah. Well, it turns out that these primitive maps correspond to a very specific type of beta-1-0 tree. Okay. And this connection allows us to count them and understand their unique properties much more easily. So it's like we're zooming in on a specific part of the map. Yeah. And the corresponding tree structure reflects that focus. Exactly. And the research doesn't stop there. They've even delved into multiple edge-free maps. Okay. So no redundant connections between two points. Yes, exactly. And you wouldn't believe this. The beta-1 trees that correspond to these maps have a unique characteristic. Every internal node, which is basically a node that's not a leaf, in the tree must have a sibling. So there's a very specific branching pattern in the tree that reflects that property of the map. Exactly. Like the tree is encoding this information about the map's structure. Exactly. Wow. And this discovery opens up a whole new way to explore and analyze these multiple edge-free maps. This is really cool. And all this from this seemingly simple sequence of numbers, A000087. Right. Who would have thought it would lead to all this complexity and these connections across different areas of math? Yeah, that's the beauty of the OEIS. It's full of surprises, and there's still more to uncover. Oh, there's more. Yeah, we haven't even touched on the connection to permutations yet. Oh, yeah, you said that earlier. Yeah. How do permutations fit into all of this? Well, it turns out that these non-separable planar maps can also be represented as special types of permutations called non-separable permutations. And these permutations have to avoid certain patterns. Okay. And that's key to the connection with the maps. So we've got maps, we've got trees, and now we've got permutations all linked together. It's a web of interconnected mathematical concepts. Wow, this is amazing. And this web is even more intricate than you might think. Oh. We'll unravel it further in the next part of our deep dive. Well, you've definitely picked my interest. That's great. I can't wait to hear more about this fascinating connection between maps, trees, and permutations. All right. This is really cool. Stay tuned. We're just getting started. Okay. Okay, so before we get into permutations, you mentioned that these special non-separable permutations have to avoid certain patterns. What do you mean by that? It all has to do with how these permutations are actually constructed. Okay. And you remember how we talked about decomposable and indecomposable beta-1 trees? Yeah. Well, it turns out that we can actually mirror those construction steps with permutations. Okay. And that's what gives us this really fascinating connection. So we're essentially building permutations in a way that mimics the structure of these special trees. Exactly. Okay. So with decomposable trees, you're basically gluing smaller indecomposable trees together at their roots to create a bigger tree. And how does that translate into the world of permutations? So you take several indecomposable permutations and arrange them side by side. Okay. And you adjust the numbers in each subsequent permutation to maintain an overall increasing order. Okay. So it's kind of like... So like building a bigger sequence from smaller kind of like self-contained sequences. Exactly. So the way we construct both decomposable trees and permutations reflects this idea of combining these smaller units. Now for indecomposable trees, things get a little bit more intricate. You extend a tree by adding an edge to a node that has a label that's less than or equal to its parent's label. Okay. It's a specific rule that governs how these trees can grow. And how do we mirror that process in the world of permutations? So imagine you have an existing permutation. Okay. To make it bigger, you would insert the largest number, let's just call it n. Okay. Right before one of its left-to-right maxima. What's a left-to-right maxima? These are like the peaks in the permutation where there's no larger number to the left. Okay. So we're strategically placing this largest number based on the existing peaks in the permutation. Exactly. But there's a catch. You have to kind of rearrange the pieces of the permutation in a very specific way. Okay. To ensure that the resulting permutation is still indecomposable and avoids those forbidden patterns that we talked about earlier. So it's not just like sticking the largest number wherever you want. Right. There are rules to make sure. Yeah, it has to be well-behaved. Yeah, well-behaved. In a sense. Okay. And by following these rules, we create this direct link between the construction of beta-1 trees and the construction of these special permutations. So it's like we're translating the language of trees into the language of permutations. Exactly. And because we already know that the trees correspond to the maps, we've essentially created a bridge between maps and permutations. Exactly. This connection mathematicians like to call it a bijection is incredibly powerful because it allows us to translate properties, the trees, into properties of the permutations and vice versa. Can you give me an example of how that works in practice? Absolutely. Okay. So remember those two faces that we were talking about? Yeah, those are the regions in the map that are bounded by two edges. Exactly. And we said that we could actually count those by looking at specific labels in the beta-1 tree. Right. Well, this property actually translates directly into what are called mesh patterns in the corresponding permutation. What are mesh patterns? So mesh patterns are a way to describe patterns in permutations that take into account not only the relative order of the elements, but also their positions within the permutation. So it's not just about... It's a little bit more detailed than just looking at the order of the elements. So it's not just about what numbers come before and after each other. Right. It's also about where they are. It's also about their location. In the sequence. Exactly. And in the case of two faces, the mesh patterns actually involve the largest element and grow in how it's positioned relative to the other elements in the permutation. So by analyzing these patterns, we can actually identify which permutations correspond to maps with those internal two faces. So we're basically using these mesh patterns
