## Transcript

Welcome back to our deep dive into the fascinating history of the Lucasian Professors of Mathematics at Cambridge. Oh, it is fascinating. This is our ninth episode. Ninth one already. I know, it's hard to believe. Time flies. And today we're turning our attention to Robert Woodhouse. Okay. The seventh individual to hold this prestigious chair. Woodhouse is an interesting figure. Yeah. Because while he might not have the instant name recognition of a Newton or a Hawking. Of course, yeah. His impact on British mathematics, especially in the early 19th century, was quite significant. So let's start with the basics. Okay. Who was Robert Woodhouse? Where did his journey begin? He was born in 1773 in Norwich. Okay. And his family, this is interesting, was actually in the textile trade. Really? His father was a linen draper. So not exactly the typical background you might expect. Not quite, no. For a future Lucasian professor. That's right. Indeed. A bit of a departure from the world of academia. What led into mathematics then? Well, his educational path offers some clues. Okay. He attended Passingham School, which as some of our listeners might know, had a really strong reputation for sending its pupils on to Gonville and Caius College. Ah, so following a well-trodden path to one of the centers of mathematical study at the time. Exactly. At that time. Precisely. And once at Caius, his talent for mathematics, it really shone through. Oh. He graduated in 1795 as senior wrangler. Okay. That's the top mathematics graduate for that year. And he also won the coveted Smith's Prize. Senior wrangler and the Smith's Prize. I know. Those are accolades. It's impressive. That speak volumes about his abilities. Oh, they certainly do. These early achievements, they really set the stage for his future influence and impact on the field. From there, his connection to Cambridge, it just deepened. He became a fellow of Gonville and Caius in 1798, a position he held for quite some time. So firmly establishing himself within the academic world. Yes. And his reputation went beyond the walls of Cambridge. 1802, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Oh, wow. So that's a clear sign of his growing stature within the broader scientific community. It seems like Cambridge was truly his intellectual home. Well, it was. Okay. So there's a twist in his personal life that reflects the norms of the time. Okay. He actually resigned his fellowship in 1823 to get married to Harriet Wilkin, the daughter of a Norwich architect. They had a son, also named Robert. Okay. So a choice between scholarship and marriage. It was. Yeah, a glimpse into those, you know, the social pressures of academia back then. Absolutely. But let's get to the heart of his work. What was it about Robert Woodhouse that made him stand out as a mathematician? His most significant contribution was his advocacy for what was, at the time, a rather revolutionary approach to mathematics, particularly in Britain. Okay. He championed a more analytical... Analytical. Analytical calculation. Can you break that down a bit for our listeners? What exactly does that mean? Yeah. And why was it so revolutionary? To understand its significance, we need to kind of understand the mathematical landscape of Britain in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. At that time, British mathematics was very heavily influenced by the work of Isaac Newton and his followers. Of course. They favored a more geometric and intuitive approach to calculus, known as fluxional calculus. So very much grounded in Newton's legacy. Exactly. However, on the continent, mathematicians were developing a more algebraic and symbolic approach to calculus, utilizing what's known as differential notation. Okay. This notation using symbols like dx and d to represent these tiny infinitesimal changes offered a more systematic and arguably more rigorous way to actually handle the concepts of calculus. So Woodhouse was advocating for this more continental approach, this shift towards differential notation. Precisely. Okay. He saw the power and efficiency in 1803. Okay. He publishes a book titled Principles of Analytical Calculation, which wasn't just a textbook. Right. It was sort of a manifesto. A mathematical manifesto. Yeah. That's a bold statement. It is. What was the reaction to his ideas? Well, not everyone embraced them with open arms. There was a degree of resistance. Yeah. Particularly from those who were very deeply rooted in the traditional Newtonian methods. Sure. They saw Woodhouse's push for this differential notation as an unnecessary complication. Perhaps even a betrayal of the legacy. Of British mathematics. Of British mathematics. I can imagine that challenging such established norms must have created some tension. Absolutely. Within the academic community. Oh, it certainly did. Yeah. But Woodhouse was a strong advocate for his views. Right. In his book, he directly critiques what he saw as the reliance on non-evident principles in the traditional approach, pushing for a more standardized and logical framework based on these continental methods. So he was ruffling some feathers, but also planting the seeds. Exactly. For a major shift in mathematical thinking. Exactly. And that shift is what we'll delve into as we continue our exploration of Woodhouse's legacy. It's fascinating how these intellectual battles play out. It is. Especially in a field like mathematics. Yeah. Where, you know, tradition and rigor are so deeply intertwined. Yeah. You mentioned that Woodhouse faced some resistance. He did. So how did his ideas ultimately gain traction? Wow. Especially within a system so rooted in Newtonian methods. That's where a group of younger mathematicians entered the picture. Okay. A group that would become known as the Analytical Society. Okay. They were really inspired by Woodhouse's vision and took up the mantle. Ah, so they were the ones who really carried the torch forward. They did. Who were some of the key figures in this Analytical Society? It included some names that might be familiar to our listeners. Okay. George Peacock. Okay. Charles Babbage. Oh, wow. Yes, that Charles Babbage. The pioneer of computing. The pioneer of computing, exactly. And John Herschel. And John Herschel. Wow, that's quite a trio. It is. What were some of the specific actions they took to champion these analytical methods? Well, they were quite strategic in their approach. One of their key moves was translating a very prominent work by the French mathematician Sylvester Loquois. Okay. They chose, specifically, a text that emphasized the analytical approach to calculus. So bringing the continental methods directly into the heart of Cambridge through translation. Precisely. Quite a bold move, I imagine. It was, and it stirred up some controversy. Yeah, I can imagine. As you can imagine. Yeah. But it also sparked a lot of debate and discussion, particularly among the younger generations of mathematicians who were more open to these new ideas. It's like they were injecting these fresh perspectives into a system. That's a great way to put it. That had become a bit set in its ways. Absolutely. Their efforts weren't limited to translation, though. They also held meetings, published their own work using differential notation, really working to cultivate a network of like-minded individuals who were interested in pushing British mathematics forward. So it was a true movement for mathematical reform then. It was. Yeah. And it was ultimately successful. Wow, that's amazing. While it's important to acknowledge that Woodhouse wasn't the sole driver of this change, of course, his influence on the Analytical Society and the impact that they had on the way mathematics was taught and practiced at Cambridge cannot be overstated. Yeah, it's a testament to the enduring power of ideas. It is. And how one person's vision can spark this chain reaction that leads to lasting change. Absolutely, and it highlights how the history of the Lucasian professorship is not just a linear progression of individuals, but a really complex interplay of influences and ideas that shape the direction of the field. We've been focusing on this idea of analytical calculation. Yes. But I'm also curious to learn more about the specific mathematical contributions that Woodhouse made beyond this advocacy. Okay. What other areas of mathematics did he explore? He was quite a prolific writer. Okay. He authored textbooks on both planar and spherical trigonometry. Okay. Those were known for their clarity and their rigor and were widely used. So he was directly shaping mathematical education through these tests. He was, but his contributions weren't limited to textbooks. Okay. He also wrote a historical treatise on a couple of rather advanced topics, the calculus of variations and isoperimetric problems. I have to admit, those sound a bit beyond my mathematical comfort zone. They are. Could you break down those concepts for our listeners? The calculus of variations, to put it simply, is a field that deals with finding optimal solutions. Okay. So things like the shortest path between two points or the shape that encloses the most area for a given perimeter. Interesting. It has applications in physics, engineering, even economics. So very much a field with practical implications. Exactly. And isoperimetric problems, while they're a subset of problems within the calculus of variations that deal specifically with figures that have the same perimeter but different areas or vice versa. It sounds like he was tackling some pretty complex mathematical concepts. Yeah, he was. What's interesting to me is this combination of his theoretical work and his more practical involvement in setting up the Cambridge Observatory, which we touched upon earlier. That's a great example of how he bridged that gap between theory and practice. His role in establishing the observatory, especially as the Plumean professor, allowed him to apply his mathematical knowledge to real-world challenges of astronomical observations. Exactly. This connection to astronomy is something I definitely want to explore further. Okay. Can you tell us more about his involvement
