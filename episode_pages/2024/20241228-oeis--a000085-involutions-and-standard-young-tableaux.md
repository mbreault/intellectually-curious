## Transcript

Welcome back to The Deep Dive. We're continuing our journey through the OEIS, and today we're going to delve into a sequence that's got some pretty fascinating connections. That's A000085. Yeah, A000085 is really interesting right off the bat because it's all about these things called involutions. Involutions. Yeah, basically think of them as like self-reversing operations. Okay, so like if you do something and then do it again, you end up back where you started. Exactly. It's like hitting that undo button. You perform an action, then perform it again, and boom, you're right back to square one. And A000085 specifically counts how many of these involutions, these self-inverse permutations, are possible for a given set of elements. Okay, I think I'm starting to get the picture here. So for example, like if we had the letters ABC, would rearranging them to CAB be an involution? That's a good question. Let's see. If we swap the first and last letters twice, do we get back to ABC? Nope, we'd end up with CAB again. Exactly. So CAB wouldn't be an involution, but if we arrange them as CBA, now that is an involution. Ah, I see. Because swapping the first and last letters twice brings us right back to CBA. You got it. Now the really cool part is that the sequence A000085, it pops up in all sorts of unexpected places in mathematics, like representation theory and graph theory. Okay, now those sound a little intimidating. How can something like involutions be connected to those fields? Well, let's take representation theory, for instance. A000085 is actually linked to these diagrams called Young Tableau. They're visual tools, really, that mathematicians use to represent and analyze the structure of groups. Okay, I'm trying to visualize this. What do these Young Tableau look like? Basically imagine a grid of boxes and you have to fill them with numbers. The catch is the numbers have to increase as you move from left to right and from top to bottom. And guess what? A000085 actually counts how many valid ways you can fill a Young Tableau of a specific size. So the way these numbers are arranged in the grid is somehow telling us something about the structure of groups. That's the amazing part. The arrangement of the numbers in these Tableau actually reflects certain symmetrical properties within mathematical groups. It's a visual representation of those symmetries. That's pretty mind-blowing. So it's not just about counting involutions. It's about understanding the deeper structure of these mathematical objects. Exactly. And you know what's even more fascinating? This whole idea of counting involutions, it also shows up in graph theory. Graph theory? I'm intrigued. Tell me more. All right. Picture a complete graph. It's like a bunch of dots called nodes, all connected to each other by lines. Okay, got it. All the dots are connected. Right. So in graph theory, A000085 actually gives us the number of possible matchings in that graph. Matchings. It means how many ways you can connect those nodes in pairs, but without any of the lines crossing each other. Oh, okay. So like each dot can only have one line connected to it, and those lines can't intersect. Precisely. And A000085 tells us how many different ways we can do that. It's all about pairing things up in a specific way. This is amazing. It seems like this one sequence, A000085, is popping up in so many different areas of math. Who would have thought? It really is remarkable, isn't it? And we've only just scratched the surface. We haven't even talked about the formulas for calculating the terms of this sequence or the intriguing nickname it has. The telephone numbers. The telephone numbers. Now that's got me curious. Well, that's a story for another time, or perhaps the next part of our deep dive. You know, before we get to those telephone numbers, I think we should maybe spend a little more time on the formulas connected to A000085. It actually has two types, recursive and non-recursive. And each gives us a different way of looking at how the sequence is structured. That's interesting. So like what's the big difference in how we should think about the sequence when we're using a recursive formula versus a non-recursive one? Well, with a recursive formula, you kind of build up the sequence one step at a time. You need the previous terms to calculate the next one in line. Okay, so like it's a step-by-step process. Yeah, exactly. So for A000085, the recursive formula looks like this. An, An-1 plus N-1 An-2. So let's say you want to find the fifth term in the sequence. Well, you'd need to know the fourth and third terms first. I see. So it's kind of like climbing a ladder. You need that previous rung to reach the next one. That's a great analogy. Each term depends on the ones before it. But now a non-recursive formula, that's a different story. How so? Well, a non-recursive formula lets you calculate any term directly. You don't need to know any of the terms that came before it. Oh, that's pretty handy. So it's like having a map that tells you exactly where to go instead of having to follow a winding path. Exactly. Now the non-recursive formula for A000085, that one involves factorials and summations, which can be a little complex. But basically what it's doing is counting all the different ways to arrange elements into those self-inverse permutations that we talked about earlier. Gotcha. So two different paths leading to the same destination. Now the source has also mentioned something called the Hankel transform, which sounded a bit intimidating, to be honest. Do I need like a PhD in math to understand that? No, not at all. The Hankel transform is just a way to create a new sequence from an existing one. And it does this based on something called determinants. Determinants. Okay, maybe a little bit of a refresher there. Sure. Determinants are these special numbers calculated from a square matrix. They're used all over math. But what's cool about the Hankel transform is that when you apply it to A000085, you get a connection to super factorials. Super factorials. Those were mentioned earlier. You mean factorials, right? You got it. So essentially A000085 has this hidden link to another even more explosive sequence, all thanks to the Hankel transform. That's wild. And we also talked about binomial transforms earlier, something about those being connected to Pascal's triangle. Yeah, exactly. Binomial transforms use these things called binomial coefficients, which are those numbers you see in Pascal's triangle. It's this beautiful triangular array of numbers that has all sorts of amazing properties. Right. And so how do those tie into A000085? Well, if you take a particular sequence, one that alternates between zeros and other numbers, and apply a binomial transform to it, guess what you get? No way. 000085. You got it. It's like uncovering a secret code within a sequence of numbers. It really seems like A000085 is a mathematical chameleon, constantly revealing these new connections and patterns depending on how we look at it. But I want to circle back to that intriguing telephone numbers nickname. You said that it wasn't just a random label. It's not random at all. It actually hints at a very practical application of involutions. Really? Okay, so how do involutions and telephones connect? Well, imagine you're designing a telephone network. You have all these phones that need to be connected to each other so that calls can go through. Right, got to connect those calls somehow. Exactly. And you can think of each phone as a point and the connections between them as lines. And here's where involutions come in. Every phone call needs a pair of phones. Yeah, and you have a caller and the receiver. Exactly. So when you make a call, you're basically creating the self-inverse pairing. Phone A is connected to phone B and vice versa. It's an involution. So by understanding the properties of involutions, these network designers could make the system more efficient. Absolutely. By studying those properties, they could figure out ways to minimize the number of switching stations needed. And that could potentially reduce costs and even improve call quality. That's a fantastic example of how an abstract mathematical concept like involutions can have these very real-world implications. It really is. And you know what? Even something as simple as shaking hands can be viewed through the lens of involutions. Shaking hands. How so? Well, think about it. If you have, let's say, 10 people and each person shakes hands with just one other person, how many different handshake pairings are possible? Hmm. I guess that's where A000085 comes in again. It's about pairing things up efficiently. Exactly. It's all about finding those efficient ways to connect or pair things up, whether it's phones in a network or people shaking hands. So even if someone isn't a mathematician, just appreciating the concept of involutions can give them a new perspective on problem-solving in everyday life. I absolutely agree. It highlights how math isn't just about formulas and equations. It's about understanding these fundamental structures and patterns that shape our world. Wow, this has been a truly insightful look at A000085. We've gone from self-inverse permutations to Young Tableau, from telephone networks to factorials of factorials. And I feel like we've only scratched the surface. We really have. The OEIS is filled with so many other fascinating sequences, each with its own set of hidden connections and surprising applications. It's a treasure trove of mathematical wonders. That's a great point, and one we'll definitely touch upon as we wrap up our deep dive into A000085. Wow, we've really covered a lot of ground in this deep dive into
