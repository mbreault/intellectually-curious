## Description

A deep dive into the centuries-old dream of an elevator to spaceâ€”from 19thâ€‘century visions to carbon nanotube challenges, geostationary orbit, and the physics of a cable spanning thousands of kilometers. We unpack the engineering hurdles, potential climbers, power and counterweight mysteries, and whether humankind will ever ride a cable car to the stars.

## Transcript

Ready to ditch this planet and head for the stars? How about an elevator ride straight to space? An elevator to space? Yeah. You know, it sounds like something straight out of science fiction. Yeah. Like in Heinlein's Friday. But the idea's been around for ages. Oh, yeah. Way older than you think. Like when? Think back to 1895. This Russian scientist, Seolkovsky, he actually envisioned this sky ladder reaching into space. Wow, 1895, that's, what, like the early days of the Eiffel Tower? Exactly. And then fast forward to 1960, another Russian, Artsutinov, independently proposes a cosmic railway using the same basic concept. Okay, so two brilliant minds, decades apart, both hit on this idea of a space elevator. There's got to be something special about it. Why not just build a really tall skyscraper or something? It's like, why an elevator? Well, think about it. Rockets, as awesome as they are, they're expensive, need tons of fuel, and let's be honest, a little risky, right? Yeah, I can see that. A space elevator, if we could actually build one, would give us this reusable way to get to space anytime we wanted. Imagine space travel as easy as, like, hopping on a cable car. Okay, but we're talking about a cable car thousands of kilometers long. How do you even start to build something that massive? It's not like building a skyscraper, right? Definitely not your average construction project. Imagine a super strong cable anchored somewhere on Earth's equator. Okay. Now stretch that cable way past what we call geostationary orbit, or GEO for short. GEO, that's... That's about 36,000 kilometers up, where a satellite's orbit syncs up perfectly with Earth's rotation. So from down here, it looks like the satellite's just hanging there in the sky. Right, right. That's where things get interesting. So we've got this massive cable anchored at the equator, stretching all the way past GEO. But what's keeping it upright? Wouldn't it just crumple under its own weight? That's where the counterweight comes in. We'd need something really heavy way out at the end of that cable, past geostationary orbit. A counterweight, so it's like a cosmic tug-of-war. Earth's gravity pulling down on the cable and this counterweight pulling out. Exactly. But even with the counterweight, wouldn't we need, like, the strongest material in the universe to build this thing? I mean, it's got to support its own weight over such a massive distance. You're hitting the nail on the head. The material for the cable is the biggest challenge, which is why we don't have space elevators already. Right. We need something with incredible tensile strength. Tensile strength. It's the ability to withstand being pulled without breaking. And, of course, it can't weigh a ton itself. So we're talking way stronger than steel, but lighter than, say, Kevlar. You're on the right track. But even those materials aren't strong enough for an Earth-based space elevator. Wow. So what can we use? What's strong enough to hold up thousands of miles of itself? It makes you wonder if such a thing even exists outside of, you know, science fiction. Well, that's where things get really interesting. Remember those carbon nanotubes we talked about? Yeah, those microscopic cylinders of carbon. Exactly. Those things are insanely strong. For their size, right? But we're talking about a cable thousands of kilometers long. How do you even go from a tiny little tube to, like, you know, something on that scale? That's the million-dollar question. Maybe a billion-dollar question in this case. Figuring out how to manufacture those carbon nanotubes on that scale. We can make them in a lab, sure. Right. But producing them in large quantities, perfectly consistent, that's a whole other story. So it's not just about finding the wonder material. Right. It's figuring out how to mass-produce it. Yeah, and without any flaws. It's a huge challenge. What makes it so hard? What's the holdup? Imagine trying to build a skyscraper. Okay. But instead of steel and concrete, you're using grains of sand. Grains of sand. Okay. And each grain has to be perfectly shaped, perfectly aligned. That gives you an idea of the level of precision we're talking about. Wow. And then there's this other thing, the taper ratio. Taper ratio, what's that? It basically tells you how much thicker the cable needs to be at GEO compared to the ground. Hold on, thicker at GEO? I thought there's less gravity pulling on it the further you get from Earth. True, but you have to factor in the apparent gravitational field. The cable's thickest at GEO, because that's the point where it's supporting the most weight, right? Right, everything hanging below it. Exactly. As you go higher, the centrifugal force gets stronger, so you actually need less and less material as you go further out. Okay, that makes sense. So the bigger the taper ratio, the more material you need, making it even harder. Has anyone actually tried to make this work? Yeah, actually. Google X, you know, the folks who like to tackle really ambitious projects. Yeah, they're kind of known for that. They actually took a stab at developing carbon nanotube production, specifically for a space elevator. Really? What happened? Well, back in 2014, they put the project on hold. They couldn't do it. Their research showed that nobody had managed to make a perfect strand of carbon nanotubes longer than a meter. So we're not even close? Not yet. Wow. All right, so let's say we do figure this whole thing out, right? We crack the code, we build this space elevator. What's it like to ride this thing? Is it like, you know, Willy Wonka's glass elevator straight up into space? Not quite. Think of it more like specialized vehicles, we call them climbers, that would travel up and down the cable. You mean porters? Yeah. Like rock climbers scaling a giant space elevator. More like high-tech trains on a vertical track. They'd grip the cable and ascend, probably using some kind of a roller system. And get this, it wouldn't be an instant teleport, but it would be way faster than a rocket. How long are we talking? Like a weekend getaway to orbit or like, you know, a long-haul flight? Think of it as a leisurely cruise, maybe five days to get to geostationary orbit. Five days? Yeah, five days at a reasonable cruising speed. Five days to GEO. That's actually pretty impressive compared to a rocket launch. Imagine the views. Oh yeah, incredible views. You descend right through the atmosphere and watch the Earth shrink below you. But those climbers, they need power. And powering something over that kind of distance, that's a whole other challenge. Yeah. You can't exactly plug it into a really, really long extension cord. How do you even start to power something like that? So we've got these climbers, maybe even powered by lasers, slowly making their way up this massive cable to space. But what about that counterweight at the other end? What's it made of and where exactly is it? Ah, the counterweight. It's what keeps the whole system from, well, collapsing back to Earth. Think of it like a really, really heavy anchor way out past geostationary orbit. Okay, so it's past GEO. But what is it, like a giant asteroid we've lassoed or something? Could be. But it doesn't have to be a single thing. It could be a space station or a spaceport or even just a bunch of heavy stuff we've launched up the elevator over time. So we could build it as we go, use the elevator to haul up its own counterweight. That's kind of neat. But why so far out? Why not just put a big weight at the very end of the cable, right at GEO? Good question. It's all about the forces at play. You've got gravity pulling down, right? And then you've got centrifugal force from the Earth spinning pulling out. We need that centrifugal force to be stronger than gravity at the counterweight. That's what keeps the whole cable taut. So it's a balancing act, literally. Gravity versus centrifugal force. But if it's so far out, wouldn't anything we release from the elevator just fly off into deep space? How would we get stuff to stay in orbit? Because the cable is spinning with the Earth, the higher up you go, the faster you're moving. And that speed, that's the key to orbit. So the further out, the faster. But how do we use that? Think about orbital velocity for a second. That's the speed you need to be going to stay in orbit at a particular altitude. If you release something below GEO, it'll fall back to Earth, right? Makes sense. But it's also moving sideways because of the cable, so it doesn't fall straight down. It goes into this elliptical orbit around the Earth. So it still orbits, just not at the height it was released from. Exactly. But here's the really wild part. If you release something above GEO, it's moving faster than orbital velocity at that height, right? Right, because the higher the faster. So it doesn't just stay in orbit, it actually flies off into space. The elevator acts like a giant slingshot. No way. Yeah. We could launch spacecraft without rockets just by letting go at the right spot on the cable. Pretty much. No massive fuel tanks, no complicated engines, just pure physics. That's mind-blowing. Okay, so we've covered some seriously cool concepts here, but also some pretty big ifs, right? Like, can we actually build this thing? Should we just stick to rockets? Yeah. What's the verdict? For now, yeah, rockets
