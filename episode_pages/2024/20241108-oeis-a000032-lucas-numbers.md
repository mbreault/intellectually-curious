## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today we're going to be looking at Lucas numbers. And for anybody who's not familiar with them, they're closely related to the Fibonacci sequence. We've got a couple of different sources here today. We're going to be looking at excerpts from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, specifically entry A000032, and the Wikipedia page on Lucas numbers. Okay, great. So yeah, we're going to be diving deep into a world of mathematical wonder. That's right. And what's so interesting about Lucas numbers is how they demonstrate that interconnectedness of mathematical concepts. We'll see how they link to Fibonacci, of course, but also the golden ratio, and then even some surprising appearances in nature. Okay, well let's unpack this first things first. What exactly are Lucas numbers? Yeah, so like Fibonacci, they're an integer sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones. The difference lies in the starting point. Lucas numbers begin with 2 and 1, whereas Fibonacci starts with 0 and 1. Okay, so that subtle difference in starting values creates a unique sequence. Yes. Okay, so the first few Lucas numbers are 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, and so on. Exactly. You just keep adding the last two numbers to get the next one, easy peasy. Yes. But here's where things get really mind-boggling. The relationship between Lucas numbers and Fibonacci numbers. Like they're doing a mathematical tango. Exactly. For example, if you add any two Fibonacci numbers that are two positions apart, you get the Lucas number nestled right between them. That's so cool. And another fascinating relationship that I saw is that if you divide a Lucas number by the corresponding Fibonacci number at the same position in their sequences, the result gets closer and closer to the square root of 5 as you venture further down the line. That's amazing, right? On the square root of 5. Now that's a curveball. What does that have to do with all of this? It's a tantalizing hint at a deeper connection. A connection that intertwines Lucas numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and the golden ratio. That mysterious number found everywhere in nature. Uh-huh, the golden ratio. Now it's all starting to click. But before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let's look at the formula for Lucas numbers. Okay. And don't worry, we won't be diving into any complex equations. No. We're aiming for understanding not a math headache. Exactly. The formula might look a bit intimidating at first glance. Yeah. But what it represents is actually quite straightforward. Okay. Each Lucas number can be directly calculated using the golden ratio, approximately 1.618, often represented by the Greek letter phi. So each Lucas number is linked to this common ratio. Okay. And this connection becomes even more apparent when you compare the formula for Lucas numbers to the one for Fibonacci numbers. Okay. Without getting too deep into the weeds, can you give us a sense of what these formulas look like? Absolutely. So the formula for Lucas numbers is L n equals phi, raised to the power of n plus 1 minus phi, also raised to the power of n. That's interesting. It sounds very similar to the Fibonacci formula, which I know involves phi as well. You're right. The formulas are remarkably alike, highlighting that deep connection between these two sequences. It's like they're two sides of the same mathematical coin. Okay, so we've got these intertwined sequences, both connected to the golden ratio. Right. Now let's get to the really cool stuff, the patterns hidden within the Lucas number sequence itself. Right. Our sources point out these fascinating multiplication and difference patterns. For example, if you have an odd number, let's call it m, then the Lucas number at position n will always divide evenly into the Lucas number at position n times. Precisely. And this is just one example of the many fascinating patterns within Lucas numbers. Yeah. It shows how predictable and structured this seemingly simple sequence can be. And our sources even provide some specific examples, like the Lucas number at position 2 is equal to the square of the Lucas number at position n minus 2 times negative 1 raised to the power of n. Yes. And another example is the Lucas number at position 3n, which is equal to the cube of the Lucas number at position n minus 3 times negative 1 to the power of n times the Lucas number at position n again. Now I know these examples might seem a bit abstract, but what they're really showing is how interconnected and predictable this sequence is. Yeah. Even something seemingly chaotic, like raising negative 1 to various powers, still results in these consistent patterns within the Lucas number sequence. You've hit the nail on the head. Right. It highlights that inherent order and elegance within these mathematical structures. Yeah. And these patterns extend beyond multiplication. Oh, okay. There are also intriguing difference equations that reveal further relationships between Lucas numbers. Okay, I'm intrigued. Tell us more about these difference equations. For instance, if you take the Lucas number at position n and subtract the Lucas number three positions back at n3, the result is always twice the Lucas number two positions back at n2. So the difference between Lucas numbers at certain intervals relates directly to other Lucas numbers within the sequence. That's pretty neat. It is. And these difference equations aren't just about revealing patterns. They also help us understand cyclical patterns, also known as moduli, within the sequence. Okay. For example, there's an equation that states the Lucas number at position n minus the Lucas number 60 positions back in 60 equals a rather large number, 4,160,200. Wow. Multiplied by the Fibonacci number at position n30. Whoa, that's quite a mouthful. It is. But what's fascinating is that this equation demonstrates that Lucas numbers create a repeating pattern every 60 terms. Okay. When we look at their remainders after dividing by 4,160,200. So even though the numbers themselves get larger and larger, there's a repeating pattern in how they relate to this specific number. Exactly. And because 4,160,200 is divisible by 100, this repeating pattern also applies to the last two digits of Lucas numbers. They also repeat in a cycle of length 60. Okay, now that's really cool. That means if we know the last two digits of a Lucas number, we can actually predict the last two digits of Lucas numbers much further down the line. Exactly. Like 60, 120, or even 180 positions away. These difference equations give us a powerful tool for predicting and understanding the behavior of Lucas numbers. Yeah. It's like having a mathematical crystal ball. Okay. Now let's switch gears and talk about prime numbers within the Lucas sequence. Okay. Which brings us to the intriguing concept of Lucas primes. Lucas primes, now that sounds intriguing. What are they? A Lucas prime is simply a prime number that also happens to be a Lucas number. Okay. The first few are 2, 3, 7, 11, 29, and so on. So prime numbers that happen to show up in the Lucas sequence. But here's something that really surprised me when I was prepping for this deep dive. While every single prime number pops up as a factor somewhere in the Fibonacci sequence, that's not the case with Lucas numbers. That's right. It's a key distinction between the two sequences. Okay. There are certain prime numbers that no matter how far you look down the Lucas sequence, you'll never find them as a factor. Like the number 5, for example. It's so closely tied to the golden ratio. Right. But it never divides evenly into any Lucas number. Yeah. And it's not alone. There's 17, 37, 53, and a whole bunch of others listed in the OEIS entry. These fascinating prime numbers, sometimes called Lucas-avoiding primes, have some very interesting properties. Okay. For instance, they tend to only appear as factors in Fibonacci numbers with odd indices. Additionally, the length of their Pisano period is always divisible by 4, but never by 8. Okay. Time for a quick time out. I think we need to explain what a Pisano period is for those who might not be familiar with the term. Think of a Pisano period as the length of a repeating pattern that a Fibonacci-like sequence exhibits when you look at the remainders after dividing by a specific number. For example, if the Fibonacci sequence itself has a Pisano period of length 60, when you look at the remainders after dividing by 10, that's why the last digit of Fibonacci numbers repeats in a cycle of 60. Okay, that makes sense. So these Lucas-avoiding primes, besides never showing up as factors in the Lucas sequence, also have this unique characteristic with their Pisano periods always divisible by 4 but not 8. Exactly. It all points back to those fascinating patterns embedded within these sequences. Precisely. It's a peek into that intricate, almost hidden structure governing these mathematical concepts. Yeah. And it really makes you wonder what other connections and patterns are still out there waiting to be discovered. Now before we move on to the next part of our deep dive, there's something I've been pondering. Okay. We've been discussing all these fascinating properties of Lucas numbers, but I'm wondering, what's the practical significance of all this? Right. Do they have any real-world applications? That's a great question, and the answer might surprise you. While Lucas numbers might seem purely theoretical, they pop up in some unexpected places. Okay. One of the most well-known examples is in phyllotaxis, which studies the arrangement of leaves, petals, and seeds in plants. Okay. Often the number of spirals in a sunflower, for example, follows the Lucas pattern alongside the more familiar Fibonacci spiral. Wait, really? So the next time I'm admiring a sunflower, I should be thinking about Lucas numbers? Yes. That's incredible.
