## Description

A deep dive into Sidron Cave in Spain, where the Tunnel of Bones held at least 13 Neanderthals. We explore their lives and deaths, from the growth of El Sidron J1 to DNA from bones and dirt, the FOXP2 clues about language, and what their vegetarian meals and possible cannibalism tell us about Neanderthal society and our shared past.

## Transcript

Okay, get this. You're spelunking in Spain, right? And bam, you find a cave, but it's not just any cave. It's packed with the bones of a whole Neanderthal family. Wow. It happened back in 1994 at Sidron Cave, and we are diving deep into their lives today. Sounds fascinating. We've got a Wikipedia article and a summary document you sent over to guide us, so let's get started. Right off the bat, the Wikipedia article mentioned something called the Ashuary Gallery. They also call it the Tunnel of Bones, which honestly sounds kind of creepy. Yeah. What is that exactly, and why is it such a big deal? Well, that's where they found the remains of at least 13 Neanderthals, all jumbled up together. Oh, wow. Three men, three teenage boys, four women, and three infants. It's like a snapshot of their whole community frozen in time 49,000 years ago. Wow, a whole family. How'd they all end up in that one spot? That doesn't seem like a natural way to go. Right. That's the million-dollar question. I mean, the way their bones are mixed up with all that gravel and mud, it's pretty clear they didn't die there naturally. Researchers have a few theories. A flash flood, maybe, you know, sweeping them into the gallery or a cave collapse trapping them inside. Oh, wow. It's hard to say for sure. Those are already pretty dramatic, but the article mentioned something even crazier, cannibalism. Is there anything to back that up? Well, there are marks on the bones themselves, cut marks and damage that looks like it came from tools. Yeah. You know, it points to the possibility that they were butchered, which, yeah, it's a tough thing to think about, but researchers are looking into it. I can imagine. That adds a whole other layer of mystery to this whole thing. But let's switch gears for a second and talk about one individual who really stood out to me, El Sidron J1, this young Neanderthal. What's so special about him? Well, the amazing thing about El Sidron J1 is how well-preserved his remains are. It gives us this rare chance to really study Neanderthal development up close. By looking at his teeth, researchers figured out he was somewhere between seven and eight years old when he died. Okay, that makes sense, but why is that such a big deal? Okay, so here's where it gets interesting. They also found that his brain was still growing. It was only about 87% the size of an average adult Neanderthal brain. Now think about modern human kids. By seven or eight, their brains are basically done cooking, almost 95% of adult size. So you're saying Neanderthals maybe matured slower than us? Why would that be? That's a great question, and there are a lot of theories floating around. It could be differences in brain development, how energy is used during childhood, or even environmental stuff. They actually found more evidence of this slower development in his vertebrae, too. Wow. Makes you wonder what it was like to be a Neanderthal kid. Yeah. Okay, we've talked bones, but what about genes? What kind of secrets are hiding in the DNA of our ancient relatives? Ugh, ancient DNA. It's like unlocking a whole other level of understanding. One of the most exciting discoveries from Sidron Cave came in 2007, when scientists found that some of the Neanderthals there, get this, shared the same mutations in the FOXP2 gene as modern humans. Hold on, why is that FOXP2 gene so important? I've never even heard of it. Well, in modern humans, the FOXP2 gene is super important for speech and language. It's even sometimes called the language gene. So finding the same mutations in Neanderthals opens up a whole can of worms about their language abilities. So were they having full-on conversations around a fire 49,000 years ago? It's not that simple. The FOXP2 gene is really complex, and just because they share some mutations doesn't automatically mean they talked like us. There are tons of other factors involved in how language develops. So it's more like we've opened a door to a new possibility, but we need to figure out what's inside. Exactly. And this is where research is headed. Speaking of DNA discoveries, though, there's another one from Sidron Cave that's even crazier. They managed to sequence a complete Neanderthal Y chromosome from one of the specimens. Oh, wow. Okay, what's so special about this Y chromosome? The crazy thing is that this particular Y chromosome, it doesn't exist in modern humans at all. It suggests that this specific Neanderthal lineage didn't contribute to our ancestry. Wait, so does that mean Neanderthals and Homo sapiens never interbred? Because I thought there was proof they did. It's important to remember we're talking about specific lineages here. So this Y chromosome might have died out, but that doesn't change the fact that Neanderthals and Homo sapiens did interbreed. Most modern humans actually carry a tiny percentage of Neanderthal DNA. Okay, that makes sense. It's like putting together a puzzle and each discovery gives us a few more pieces. Right. But speaking of uncovering secrets, the article mentions something about getting DNA from dirt. How is that even possible? Ah, you're talking about this amazing study from 2017 where researchers sequenced Neanderthal DNA straight from the cave dirt. It's totally changing the way we study the past. Wow, that's incredible. So even if there aren't any bones, their DNA can just hang out in the soil for thousands of years? Pretty much. It's like they leave genetic fingerprints in the earth. And caves like Sidron, they're perfect for preserving this ancient DNA. So what can we learn from this soil DNA? What's the point? Well, we can identify individuals even without any bones. We can figure out how they're related and even track their movements over time by analyzing the DNA in different parts of the cave. That's mind-blowing. It's like CSI, but for prehistory. Yeah, exactly. It opens up so many possibilities. This is all so fascinating, but hold on. Before we go any further, I gotta know, what did these Neanderthals eat? Were they big meat eaters like we always picture? That's actually one of the biggest surprises from Sidron Cave. The 2017 research, it showed that they were mostly vegetarian, eating things like pine nuts, moss, and mushrooms. Wait, really? Mushrooms and moss? That's so different from the image of them hunting mammoths with spears. I know, right? It really challenges our assumptions. What it tells us is that the Neanderthals in this area were super adaptable. They knew how to use all kinds of food sources, depending on their environment. So less about strictly meat or plants, more about being opportunistic and making do with what they had. Exactly. Being flexible like that probably helped them survive in different environments for thousands of years. This is incredible. We've learned so much already about their family, how they grew up, their genes, what they ate, who knew a cave in Spain could hold so many secrets. And there's more to come. This has been an awesome journey so far, and I can't wait to see what other mysteries we unravel as we keep going. But let's take a break. Let all this amazing info sink in. We'll be right back with more insights into the lives of the Sidron Cave Neanderthals. Okay, we're back, and I gotta say, I'm still kind of stuck on those Neanderthals munching on moss and mushrooms. It's pretty wild. It really changes how you picture them. I know. It's amazing how these new discoveries can just turn our old ideas on their heads. We always think of Neanderthals as these hardcore meat eaters, but Sidron Cave shows us there's way more to the story. Totally. Speaking of more to the story, the article mentions some interesting things about their physical features too. Did anything in particular jump out at you? Yeah, their morphology, their physical form is super interesting. Like they had all the classic Neanderthal traits, but some things were kind of on the fringes of what we normally see. Okay, I'm all ears. What kind of things are we talking about? Well, their mandibles, their lower jaws are a good example. Researchers have noticed this pattern linked to geography. So the Sidron Neanderthals, being from the north of the Iberian Peninsula, have these subtle differences from Neanderthals found down south. So even within Neanderthals, there were like regional differences. Right. What would cause that? A few things, maybe. It could be adaptations to different environments, like slightly different food sources. Or it could be genetic drift, where small changes in genes just happen over time, especially in isolated groups. That makes sense. Kind of like how different groups of people today have developed unique features over generations. Okay, let's loop back to something we talked about earlier, the FOXP2 gene. Oh, yeah. I'm still super curious about what it could tell us about how Neanderthals communicated. It's one of the most fascinating parts of this whole puzzle. Like we said, this gene is key for how we develop speech and language. And the fact that some of those Sidron Neanderthals had the same mutations in this gene as us, it opens up so many questions. But you also said we've got to be careful about how we interpret those results. Can you explain why? Sure. So the FOXP2 gene, it's incredibly complicated, and we're still learning about everything it does. Those shared mutations are definitely interesting. They might suggest Neanderthals had complex language, but it's not proof. Gotcha
