## Transcript

Welcome to another deep dive. This time, we're tackling a battle so big it practically rewrote the history books, at least the ones on Japan. The Battle of Sekigahara, October 21st, 1600. Buckle up, because you've sent us the Wikipedia page, and this one is chock full of samurai drama. Yeah, and you know, it's more than just sword fights and epic tools, though I'm sure we'll get to some of that. This is about what happens when a country, in this case Japan, is teetering on the edge of, well, chaos. Because a five-year-old is in charge. I mean, that's what the pamphlet says, right? Toyotomi Hideyoshi kicks the bucket, and his heir is barely out of diapers. Five years old, can you imagine? So yeah, the power vacuum is real, and into this void step two figures who you really need to know, Ishida Mitsunari and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Okay, so Mitsunari and Ieyasu, were they like best buds or sworn enemies? How does this whole two-army thing shake out? Think less best buds and more like two guys who ace every strategy game ever invented, suddenly in charge of real armies. Mitsunari is the loyal one, backing the Toyotomi clan, even with a kid at the top. He heads up the Western Army. Right, and Ieyasu, he's got other ideas, I'm guessing. Oh yeah, Ieyasu sees this as his moment. He's ambitious, cunning, and he leads the Eastern Army. So you've got this clash of ideals, personalities, and it all comes to a head at Sekigahara. But it's not like someone just yelled go and everyone started swinging katanas, right? This wasn't just one big free-for-all. Right. The lead-up is like this massive chess match, castles are the pieces, and the whole country's the board. There were sieges, skirmishes, power moves for weeks leading up to the main event. Give us an example, like what kind of stuff was going down before we even get to Sekigahara? Well, take Gifu Castle, super important stronghold. Ieyasu's right-hand man, Fukushima Masanori, takes it before the two main armies even meet. Okay, so Fukushima is a name to remember. What made him so tough? He was a beast. Fast, decisive. And this victory showed everyone Ieyasu meant business. But here's the thing about Sekigahara. Imagine all this tension, right? Years in the making. And then on the morning of the battle... Fog. Fog? Yeah. Seriously, talk about setting the mood. Thick fog. Like can't see your hand in front of your face fog. Wow, so they're about to decide the fate of Japan. And they can barely see. This is nuts. Okay, hold on. So we've got two armies ready to rumble. And suddenly, bam! Pea soup fog rolls in. Talk about a curveball. What does that even do to battle plans? Throws everything out the window, basically. Suddenly all that careful planning, the formations, the flanking maneuvers, useless. Now it's down to who can adapt, who can think on their feet. In the middle of a battlefield where you can barely see your own feet. And that's where our boy Kobayakawa comes in, right? The guy who Wikipedia politely calls a pivotal figure. More like the king of chaos, from what I'm hearing. He's the wild card for sure. Imagine being Kobayakawa. You're leading a big chunk of the Western Army, at least on paper. But Ieyasu's been making promises, whispering in your ear about power, land, all the good stuff, if you just, you know, switch sides. Talk about a dilemma. On the one hand, loyalty. On the other, a chance to basically win the lottery. So what tips the scales for Kobayakawa? Well, the traditional story, the one that makes Ieyasu look like a boss, is that he gets impatient. Kobayakawa's hesitating, and Ieyasu's not the waiting type. So he just orders his guys to fire on Kobayakawa's troops. Wait, what? He fires on his own supposed ally? Archivists, those early muskets right at Kobayakawa's lines. Basically saying, get with the program or else. Talk about a power move. That's cold. But I mean effective, I guess. So is that it? Kobayakawa folds under pressure? It's a good story, right? And for a long time, that was the accepted version. But like any good historical mystery, there's more to it. Some historians now think Kobayakawa was already leaning towards betrayal before the first shot was fired. So maybe he was playing both sides the whole time, using the fog as cover? Maybe. Or maybe he was genuinely torn, and the fog just gave him the cover to finally make a move, without anyone knowing for sure what he was really thinking until it was too late. Sneaky. But betrayal or not, he completely changes the game, right? Oh, absolutely. At that moment when the battle hangs in the balance, Kobayakawa's forces turn on their own side. Imagine the chaos, the confusion, as your supposed allies become your attackers. Talk about a backstab. What do Mitsunari's forces do? I mean, how do you even react to that? It's like a domino effect. Once Kobayakawa breaks ranks, other Western allies start to waver. Some might have been bribed beforehand, others just saw which way the wind was blowing and decided to save their own necks. And Mitsunari, he must have been furious. The guy's known as a strategic genius, and suddenly his army's falling apart around him. Yeah, talk about a bad day to be Ishida Mitsunari. He goes from having a numerical advantage to fighting a desperate rear-guard action, trying to hold on as his forces crumble around him. And Ieyasu, he's not just sitting back watching this all unfold, right? Oh, Ieyasu. He smells victory. He rallies his troops, presses his advantage. He's got commanders like Fukushima Masanori, who we talked about earlier, just tearing through the enemy lines. Remember, Masanori's guys crushed the forces led by Yukide Hideyoshi. What was it about Masanori's troops? Were they just, like, super soldiers? They were tough, no doubt. But a lot of it came down to loyalty. Masanori had a core of veteran samurai, guys who'd fought with him for years. Hidey had to rely on mercenaries because of, well, some problems back home. So it's not just about numbers. It's about who's got your back, literally in the heat of battle. Exactly. And for the Western Army, that sense of betrayal of being stabbed in the back by your own side, it must have been devastating. Imagine the demoralization, the feeling of, like, what are we even fighting for anymore? Yeah, that'll take the wind out of your sails. So with all this going on, how long does it take for Mitsunari's side to completely fall apart? I mean, is this a long, drawn-out defeat, or does it all unravel pretty quickly? Two hours, you said. That's wild. I mean, I guess when everything falls apart that fast, there's not much time for things to drag on. Exactly. It shows how quickly things could change on a Sengoku period battlefield, especially after a decisive turn of events like Kobayakawa's betrayal. It wasn't a battle of attrition. It was about seizing the moment. And Ieyasu, he was a master of seizing the moment, wasn't he? So the fog clears. He's standing victorious. What's next on his to-do list? Consolidating power, of course. Ieyasu was smart enough to realize that winning the battle was just the first step. He needed to make sure his victory stuck. And how do you do that when you've got a whole country in chaos? It's all about rewards and, well, let's call them consequences. Ieyasu went full-on Game of Thrones mode. Land redistribution, promotions for his loyal guys, and for those who backed the wrong horse, not so much. Sounds like some serious real estate deals went down. Who came out on top besides Ieyasu, obviously? Well, you can't talk about Sekigahara without mentioning Kobayakawa Hideaki again. Betrayal or not, the guy walked away with a 520,000 koku domain. 520,000. That's a lot of zeros. Remind us what that actually means. Koku equals rice power, basically. One koku could feed a person for a year back then. So Kobayakawa is swimming in rice, influence, all of it. Talk about a return on investment, huh? But did everyone just accept that? I mean, this guy basically turned on his allies at the last second. Oh, there were definitely some raised eyebrows. But Ieyasu was sending a message. Choose my side and you'll be rewarded, even if you come in late. It's good to be on the winning team, as they say. And what about the guys on the not-so-winning team? Let's just say Ieyasu wasn't big on second chances. Mitsunari's allies, many of them lost their land, their titles, everything. The Chosokabe clan wiped out their domain went to the Yamauchi, who were all about Team Ieyasu. Harsh but effective, I guess. What about Mitsunari himself? Did he ever get to see Ieyasu's new world order? Mitsunari, along with
