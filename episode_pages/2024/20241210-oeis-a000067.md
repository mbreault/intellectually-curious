## Transcript

Welcome back. We're diving back into the OEIS today. And you know, some sequences in there, they just feel kind of special. A00067 is one of those, I don't know, it's like a puzzle box and we're going to try to unlock it. Yeah, it's a real classic, even included in Sloan's early work, you know? What gets me about A00067 is it combines simple, you know, arithmetic with deep number theory concepts. Okay, let's unpack it then. A00067 counts how many positive integers less than or equal to 2 to the power of n can be expressed in the form x squared plus 2 times y squared. x and y also integers, of course. Right, think of it like a recipe. You take an integer, square it, take another one, square it, multiply by 2 and add them up. This sequence counts how many numbers you can make that way within a certain range. Okay, so for n is 3, the sequence gives us 6. Can we see how those 6 numbers fit the pattern? Absolutely, yeah. For n is 3, we're looking at integers less than or equal to 8. So we can express 1 as 1 squared plus 2 times 0 squared. 2 is 0 squared plus 2 times 1 squared. 3 is 1 squared plus 2 times 1 squared. 4 is 2 squared plus 2 times 0 squared. 6 would be 2 squared plus 2 times 1 squared. And finally, 8 is 0 squared plus 2 times 2 squared. Okay, I see. This seems like a pretty specific rule, maybe even arbitrary for making these numbers. What makes this specific form, you know, the x squared plus 2 times y squared so interesting mathematically? Well, it's a great question. The form x squared plus 2 times y squared actually belongs to a special category of quadratic forms. They're called positive definite forms. And these forms always give you positive values no matter what you put in for x and y, except of course when x and y are both 0. So no matter what integers you choose for x and y, the result of x squared plus 2 times y squared will always be positive unless both x and y are 0. Exactly. Oh, you see this positive definiteness all the time in physics, right? Like when you're modeling energy. Exactly, yeah. It makes sure that the energy of a system is always positive, which, well, makes sense because you can't have negative energy. And this has big implications in number theory too. It ensures that A00067 grows steadily as n increases. Makes sense because as n increases, the range of possible values for x and y also increases, leading to more numbers that can be represented by the form x squared plus 2 times y squared, right? Precisely. The OEIS entry for A00067 shows this growth, you know? The sequence starts 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and keeps climbing as n gets bigger. It's like watching a mathematical staircase. Each step, a new set of numbers that you can make using this quadratic form. Hold on though, there's something about Landau's theorem mentioned in the entry. Didn't he do a lot of work on quadratic forms? He did. Edmund Landau was a really prominent number theorist in the early 20th century. He made a lot of important contributions, especially to quadratic forms. His work probably gives us a deeper framework for understanding how sequences like A00067 behave. So Landau's work gives us a way to predict, almost like a crystal ball, how many numbers can be represented by this form as we go higher and higher. It's a great analogy. And there's this other interesting link in the OEIS entry. Index entries for sequences related to populations of quadratic forms. And it hints at how interconnected math ideas are within the OEIS. This link makes me wonder, are there some quadratic forms that are, I don't know, more popular than others? Like, do they represent more numbers within a certain range? I'd love to go down that rabbit hole sometime. But let's stick with A00067 for now. That's a fascinating question. It really makes you think, are some quadratic forms more efficient at representing numbers? You know, like there's a whole popularity contest based on how many integers they can generate. Okay, but let's get back to A00067 and its connection to this whole world of quadratic forms. So it's not just about this one sequence, but a window into a whole category of math things. Exactly. Yeah. And within all those quadratic forms, A00067, it has its own little niche, right? It's all about counting the numbers represented by x squared plus 2 times y squared. Right. We talked about how it's positive definite, but are there any other, I don't know, special properties of this specific form that make it stand out? Now that's where things get really interesting. The form x squared plus 2 times y squared, it has these deep connections to other math concepts, especially in geometry. You remember when we talked about lattices? Vaguely. It sounded like something from a crystallography textbook. Well, you're not wrong. Lattices are these regular arrangements of points in space, and they have a surprising connection to number theory, especially to quadratic forms. Wait, so you're saying that this sequence, A00067, it has a visual representation, like some sort of geometric pattern? It's more like the form x squared plus 2 times y squared can be visualized using lattices. Imagine you plot points on a grid, right? Each point has coordinates, x, y. Now if you only plot the points that solve the equation x squared plus 2 times y squared equals some constant, you'll start to see this lattice structure. Oh, interesting. So the numbers in our sequence, they would match specific points on this lattice. Precisely. And the properties of this lattice can tell us more about how the sequence behaves, how it grows, how it connects to other number theory ideas. It's a really cool example of how different parts of math come together. That's amazing. It really shows how interconnected different areas of knowledge are. I'm starting to see why A00067 feels so special, you know? It's not just a list of numbers. It's like a key to a whole network of math ideas. Absolutely. And the more you dig into the OEIS, the more you see how many sequences are like that. Each one, potentially a portal to a different mathematical world. Yeah, it's amazing how visual it gets when you think about lattices. I'm really starting to see how a sequence of numbers can be so much more than just, you know, a list of numbers. That's what I love about the OEIS. Every entry, it can be like a rabbit hole to explore a whole new mathematical world. Oh, speaking of rabbit holes, you mentioned earlier that link to index entries for sequences related to populations of quadratic forms. Yeah. Have you gotten to dive into that at all? I'm still kind of curious about those popular quadratic forms. Oh, yeah. It's an area I'm still looking into. But it feels like it's a whole field of study in itself. Researchers are looking at how the numbers represented by different quadratic forms are distributed, almost like it's an ecological study, but for numbers. Huh. So some quadratic forms are more, I don't know, biodiverse than others. That's a weird analogy. Yeah, I know, but it kind of works. Some forms, they make a wider range of numbers, while others are more specialized. There are even connections to cryptography, believe it or not. Certain quadratic forms play a role in how encryption algorithms work. It just blows my mind how these, like, abstract math concepts end up having these real-world uses. Absolutely, yeah. And that's what makes digging into the OEIS so rewarding. It reminds you how connected knowledge is and how powerful abstract thinking can be. So as we wrap up our deep dive into A00067, what's the big takeaway you want our listeners to walk away with? Well, I think the main point here is that even a simple-looking sequence can lead to a whole world of mathematical beauty and complexity. You know, A00067, with its squares and doubles, takes us to positive definite quadratic forms, lattices, geometry, even cryptography. It really shows how interconnected math is. Yeah, it's the perfect example of how the OEIS can make you curious and then, bam, unexpected discoveries. Absolutely. And for our listeners who are, well, feeling adventurous, I'd say go explore the OEIS entry for A00067 yourselves. See what else you can find. You never know what one sequence might lead to. Until next time then, happy exploring.
