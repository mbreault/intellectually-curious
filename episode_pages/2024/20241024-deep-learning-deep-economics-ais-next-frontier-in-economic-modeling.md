## Transcript

Hey everyone and welcome back for another deep dive. You know those times you go down a research rabbit hole and it's just like, whoa, mind blown. That's what this one was for me. So we're talking deep learning, you know, the tech behind self-driving cars and all that. But get this, it's about to seriously shake up economics. No, seriously, I'm not kidding. We've got an expert in both deep learning and economics with us today. So welcome to the show. Glad to be here. Okay, full disclosure. My first thought was deep learning to solve economic models. But then I started digging in and I saw how huge this could be. We're talking about using AI to tackle some of the biggest challenges in how we understand the economy. So to kick things off, can you give us the why this is a big deal overview? Well, economists have relied on these things called dynamic equilibrium models for a long time. DEMs for short. They're used everywhere, from predicting economic growth to understanding how financial markets work. Okay, DEMs, got it. But for those of us who haven't exactly been poring over econ textbooks, what's the deal with these models and why should we care? Imagine you're trying to understand how traffic works, right? You've got all these individual drivers making choices that impact everyone else on the road. Right. DEMs are similar, but instead of cars, we're talking about people, businesses, governments, all making decisions about spending, saving, investing, and all those choices interact to shape the overall economy. So it's like this giant interconnected web of decisions. And these models try to make sense of it all. Yeah. Makes sense. But I have to imagine the more detailed you get, the more complex these models become. Exactly. You hit the nail on the head. The more variables you add, like different types of drivers, road conditions, traffic signals, I'll just stick with our analogy, the harder it becomes to actually solve the model. That's what we call the curse of dimensionality. Think of it like trying to find a specific grain of sand on a beach, technically possible, but practically impossible. Okay. Yeah. I'm starting to see the problem here. So if these DEMs get so complex, they're almost impossible to use. Yeah. How have economists even been working with them at all? And that is the million dollar question. That's where deep learning comes in. It's like having a super powered magnifying glass for complex data. Deep learning can spot patterns and make connections that traditional methods miss. And that makes it possible to actually work with these incredibly detailed economic models. So deep learning is like the superhero of economic modeling. That's pretty cool. But I have to ask, are there any downsides to using deep learning in this way? It can't be that easy, right? You're right. There are definitely challenges. One of the biggest ones is that economic systems are constantly evolving. Remember that web of interconnected decisions? Yeah. Well, imagine trying to predict what that web will look like in the future when the decisions being made are being influenced by the predictions themselves. Whoa. That's like a prediction paradox or something. It's like trying to predict the weather when the weather itself is changing based on our predictions. Exactly. It's a continuous feedback loop. And it's one of the things that makes building accurate economic models so tricky. But it's also where deep learning has the potential to be a game changer. Because it can adapt and learn from new data in a way that traditional models just can't. So how do you actually train a deep learning model to do this? What kind of data do you feed it? What does the learning process even look like? It's like we're teaching a computer to read the economic tea leaves or something. But instead of tea leaves, it's just mountains of data. That's a great way to put it. Basically, we feed the deep learning model a ton of data. Data that we generate by simulating the economic model under different conditions. And the model learns from these simulations. It keeps making adjustments until it can accurately predict the outcome. Kind of like how we learn from our experiences, right? So it's trial and error for the AI too. That makes sense. But that brings up another question. How do we know this whole deep learning thing is actually working? Can you give us a real world example of how it's being used in economics right now? Absolutely. One really interesting example is in modeling retirement savings. You see, figuring out how much to save for retirement is a classic economic puzzle. Oh, tell me about it. Trying to balance my budget today versus saving for the future. It sometimes feels like a game of economic chicken. Exactly. And it gets even more complex when you factor in things like uncertain future income, investment risks, changing life expectancies. Traditional models often struggle to capture all those nuances. But deep learning can handle it. So how does deep learning change the game when it comes to retirement planning? Is it really giving us better insights than traditional methods? It is. For example, researchers have used deep learning to study how people react to different incentives for retirement savings. And what they're finding is that people's behavior is often far more nuanced and context dependent than traditional models assumed. So it's not just about how much money you're putting away. It's also when, how, and what kind of incentives you're responding to. Precisely. And these are insights we just couldn't get. Not with the same level of detail anyway. Not using older modeling techniques. This kind of understanding has big implications for designing more effective retirement policies. Ones that actually encourage people to save enough for their golden years. Okay, now that's what I'm talking about. Real world impact. Yeah. But retirement planning is just one piece of the puzzle, right? What other economic mysteries is deep learning helping us solve? Another really exciting area is in something called heterogeneous agent models. Now traditional economic models, they often assume that everyone is the same. That we all make perfectly rational decisions based on the same information. Yeah, right. Like everyone has the time and energy to perfectly calculate every economic decision they make. In reality, we're all over the map. Exactly. We're not robots. Heterogeneous agent models address this by allowing for more diversity in how people behave. For example, some people are naturally more risk averse than others. Some are more optimistic about the future and so on. Deep learning helps us model this complexity in a way that was basically impossible before. So instead of assuming everyone's the same, we can finally start to build models that reflect the beautiful messiness of human behavior. That's the goal. And it's not just about behavior either. Heterogeneous agent models can also take into account differences in income, wealth, access to information. This allows us to create more realistic and equitable economic models. Ones that better reflect the experiences of different groups within society. It's like we're upgrading from a one size fits all economic model to one that's tailor-made for the real world. I like that analogy. And this is especially important when we're trying to understand issues like income inequality. Or the impact of economic policies on different segments of the population. This is all incredibly fascinating. But I have to admit, part of me is wondering, if these deep learning models get so complex and nuanced, how can we even be sure they're not just making stuff up? How do we ensure they're actually reflecting reality? That's a really important question. And it gets to the heart of one of the biggest challenges with deep learning in general, not just in economics. It's called overfitting. Overfitting. It's like that word is setting off alarm bells in my head. What does it actually mean in this context? Imagine a student who memorizes all the answers to a practice test. But they can't actually apply the concepts to solve new problems. They've overfit to the practice material. Similarly, a deep learning model can overfit to its training data. It becomes really good at making predictions within that specific data set, but then it fails when it's faced with new, unseen data. Oh, okay. So it's like the model gets so busy memorizing the details of the training data that it misses the bigger picture, the underlying economic forces that are actually at play. Exactly. And that's how you get unreliable predictions and misleading conclusions. So how do we prevent these deep learning models from becoming like economic know-it-alls? You know, the ones who crumble when they're faced with the real world. That is the million dollar question. There are a few different strategies. One is to use a technique called cross-validation. It's basically like giving the model a pop quiz, using data it hasn't seen before. If it performs well, great. If not, it's back to the drawing board. Makes sense. Test its knowledge with something unexpected. But it can't all be about avoiding pitfalls, right? What are some of the most promising directions for deep learning in economics going forward? Oh, the possibilities are really exciting. One area I'm really interested in is using deep learning to tackle complex policy questions. For example, imagine trying to predict the impact of a new carbon tax on the economy. It's a massively complex problem with countless variables. Deep learning could help us build these incredibly detailed models, ones that factor in everything from consumer behavior to global supply chains. And that would give policymakers a much clearer picture of the potential consequences of their decisions. Now that's what I'm talking about. Using technology to tackle some of the biggest challenges facing our world. Are there any other areas you're particularly excited about? Yeah, I'm also fascinated by the potential of deep learning to improve economic forecasting. Imagine being able to predict recessions with greater accuracy or anticipate market bubbles before they burst. Deep learning models, with their ability to sift through mountains of data and uncover hidden patterns, they could totally revolutionize how we approach economic forecasting. It sounds like we're on the verge of a whole new era in economics, one where deep learning helps us unlock this deeper understanding of how the world works. I think so. It's a really dynamic field with so much potential
