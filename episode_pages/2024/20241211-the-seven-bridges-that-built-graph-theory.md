## Description

From KÃ¶nigsbergâ€™s legendary bridges to the birth of graph theory: how Euler turned a simple city puzzle into a universal framework by treating landmasses as nodes and bridges as edges. Weâ€™ll trace Eulerian paths and circuits, Heierholzerâ€™s formalization, and the far-reaching impact on networks, routing, and optimizationâ€”plus a hands-on challenge to design your own Eulerian puzzle.

## Transcript

Welcome back everybody to another deep dive. Today we're heading back in time to 18th century Prussia. Ah, Prussia. To a city you might have heard of, KÃ¶nigsberg. Okay, yeah. Now KÃ¶nigsberg had this very interesting layout. Two islands right smack in the middle of the Pregel River. Okay. And get this, those islands were connected to each other and to two mainland portions by, count them, seven bridges. Seven bridges, alright. So you can imagine with that kind of setup, it's like a puzzle waiting to happen. I would think so. And that's exactly what happened. The locals came up with a little brain teaser. Could you walk through the city and cross each of those seven bridges exactly once? That sounds like a challenge. Oh, it was. People tried all sorts of routes, but nobody could crack it. Really? Yeah, it stumped them for years. Until, enter Leonhard Euler. Euler. Swiss mathematician, brilliant mind. Okay. In 1736, he decided to tackle this bridge problem. And? But here's the thing, his solution, well, it did more than just solve the KÃ¶nigsberg puzzle. What do you mean? It ended up creating a whole new field of mathematics. Really? From this bridge puzzle. Yep. So Euler, he had this amazing insight. He realized the layout of KÃ¶nigsberg wasn't really the heart of the issue. Okay. What mattered were the connections between the land and the bridges. I see, the relationships. Exactly. So he did something pretty radical. He took the land masses, turned them into what we now call nodes, the bridges. Those became edges. Creating a graph. You got it. So he essentially made an abstract representation of the city. Exactly. He turned a real world map into this network of points and lines. And that was revolutionary. I can see how that would be a helpful way to visualize the problem. Oh, absolutely. It was a huge leap. Allowed him to analyze the relationships mathematically. And I'm guessing this simplification was key to finding the solution. Oh, you bet. But how did he actually use this graph to crack the bridge problem? Well, that's where things get really interesting. Okay, I'm all ears. So Euler, while studying this graph, he discovered a fundamental principle. And what was that? For any walk to exist where you cross every single edge, meaning every bridge, only once, each node or land mass has to have an even number of edges connected to it. An even number. Why is that? Think about it. Every time you enter a land mass, you're crossing a bridge. Right. Well, unless it's the start or finish of your walk, you need another bridge to get out. Oh, so you always need a way in and a way out. Exactly. And if a land mass has an odd number of bridges, well, you're going to get stuck. Ah, I see. That makes sense. So armed with this principle, Euler took a look at his KÃ¶nigsberg graph. And what did he find? Well, tell me, what did he find? Was the puzzle solvable? Well, I think that's a story for part two. He found that all four land masses in KÃ¶nigsberg had an odd number of bridges connected to them. So no matter how you sliced it, it was mathematically impossible. To find that walking route. Right. So the puzzle, it was unsolvable. But in proving that, Euler had actually done something much bigger. So he created a whole new mathematical concept. Graph theory. And I got to say, at first glance, it might have seemed like, okay, cool, you solved a puzzle. Yeah. But graph theory, this wasn't just some intellectual curiosity. Not at all. This thing, it blossomed. It's everywhere. It's found applications in all sorts of fields. Like in computer science. You use it for network optimization. Logistics. Figuring out the most efficient routes. Absolutely. And even... Positional networks. Mapping out those complex relationships. All sorts of things. So Euler's work, it had a much wider impact. Way beyond that bridge puzzle. Than anyone could have imagined. Definitely. It's pretty amazing how such a simple puzzle... Seemingly simple. Led to this huge shift. It's a fundamental shift. In mathematical thinking. Absolutely. And you know, it's worth pointing out. What's that? Well, Euler, he laid the groundwork. He kind of provided the initial spark. There was another mathematician. Who? Carl Heierholzer. Oh, Heierholzer. He came along a bit later, 1873. Okay. And he really formalized the theory. I see. So he built on Euler's foundation. Exactly. And how did he contribute to our understanding of graph theory? Well, Heierholzer, he provided a much more comprehensive proof. And he clearly defined the conditions for what we now call Eulerian paths and circuits. Eulerian paths and circuits. Yeah, he basically solidified this idea for an Eulerian circuit to exist. That means you can start and end at the same point. Okay. All the nodes have to have an even degree. An even degree. Meaning an even number of connections. I see. But for a path where the start and end are different, only two nodes can have an odd degree. Okay. That clarifies it a bit more. But you know what? Let's circle back to KÃ¶nigsberg for a moment. Okay. Because did that city, did it remain mathematically unsolvable forever? Well, you see, history had other plans. What do you mean? During World War II. Oh, no. Two of those original seven bridges, they were destroyed. Destroyed. And later on, two more were demolished. Really? Replaced with a highway. Wow. So the layout, it was completely changed. Oh, yeah. The graph of KÃ¶nigsberg, it was altered significantly. Wait a minute. Are you saying that the destruction and reconstruction, it actually changed the mathematical solution to the problem? Exactly. Whoa. With only five bridges left in the same spots as Euler's time, an Eulerian path, it became possible. So after centuries of being impossible. Yeah. Now you could actually walk a path through the city. You could? And cross each bridge only once. That's right. But there's a catch. Oh. Because two of the land masses still have an odd number of bridges. Right. Any Eulerian path would have to start at one of those and end at the other one. So you can't complete a circuit. Not anymore. You can't end up back where you started. Exactly. It's amazing how historical events can actually change. You wouldn't think it. The mathematical properties of a problem like this. It's fascinating, isn't it? It really is. You know, it makes me wonder. Yeah. Have people tried to recreate this puzzle elsewhere? You mean like in a more controlled setting? Exactly. I'm glad you asked because- People have- You can actually find real world models of the seven bridges problem. Really? Oh, yeah. Like where? Well, one that comes to mind is at the University of Canterbury. Okay. In New Zealand. New Zealand? They actually recreated the whole thing. Wow. They built their own KÃ¶nigsberg. Well, kind of. So what, they have like little islands and bridges and everything? Yeah, it's more of a grassy layout. But it has the same setup, you know, the land masses and the bridges all in the right spots. And people can actually walk the path. They can. Test it out for themselves. Exactly. See if they can find a new Eulerian path. That's so cool. It's incredible how a puzzle from 18th century Prussia- Hundreds of years ago. Can still capture people's imaginations today. Absolutely. It really shows how powerful Euler's insight was. It wasn't just about those bridges. It was about creating a whole new way of thinking about connections and relationships. And that led to graph theory. And graph theory, as we've been talking about, it's not just some theoretical concept. It's got- Real world applications. Everywhere. It really does. It helps us understand and navigate the world. Absolutely. We're talking- Optimizing delivery routes. Yeah. Understanding how information spreads. All thanks to graph theory. Pretty amazing, right? It really is. It shows you that- Yeah. Curiosity and abstract thinking- Can lead to- Real breakthroughs. Breakthroughs that have- Far reaching consequences. And you know what? I think our listeners are ready for a challenge. Oh, you do? I do, so- Okay, hit me with it. Why don't you, our listeners, try designing your own seven bridges puzzle. Ooh, that's a good one. Think about different configurations. Yeah. Land masses, bridges. How many bridges can you connect to each land mass? And still be able to- Create that Eulerian path. Or even a circuit. Right. It's a fun way to play around with- The principles of graph theory. And see how these seemingly simple rules- Or some really complex outcomes. It's a good challenge. So, as we wrap up our deep dive into the seven bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg. KÃ¶nigsberg. I hope you're leaving with a new appreciation for abstract thinking. Absolutely. And how seemingly unrelated things- Yeah. Like math and history and even urban planning- All connected. Can be interconnected. All connected. And who knows, maybe you'll be the one to discover the next hidden connection. That's right. The one that leads to- A brand new breakthrough. Inspired by, well, maybe a simple puzzle. You never know.
