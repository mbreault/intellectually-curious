## Transcript

Welcome to the deep dive everyone. We're kicking off a brand new series and I am so excited to dig into this one. This whole series is going to be all about the Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics at Cambridge. You know some people think of it as like Newton's chair, you know. Right. But there's so much more to the story. I think what's really fascinating about the Lucasian chair is that it's not just a position like you said, it's a lineage. And a story about how mathematical thought has evolved over centuries, shaped by all the people who have held this role, this prestigious role. Yeah and we'll get to know all those brilliant minds. I mean the big names are people like Newton and Hawking, but some that you might not even recognize. We'll get to those names in future episodes. But for today we're taking a deep dive into the origins and evolution of the chair itself. Just to set the stage for meeting all these incredible people who have sat in it. Okay so the story begins in 1663 with Henry Lucas. He was a member of parliament, really deeply passionate about what was then called mathematical sciences. And he established the chair in his will, envisioning a professorship dedicated to pushing the boundaries of mathematical knowledge. So right from the very beginning it was designed to be like a platform for groundbreaking research. Yes. I mean King Charles II officially established the chair the following year, and then the first person appointed was Isaac Barrow. Barrow was quite a significant figure in his own right. He was known for his work in geometry, particularly his method of tangents. Okay so for people like me who are not mathematicians, what is the method of tangents? Sure you can think of it as like a precursor to calculus. It's about exploring the concept of finding the slope of a curve at a particular point. Okay so we're talking about some pretty heady stuff here. It sounds like Barrow was already making waves in the math world. Yes. But he didn't hold the Lucasian chair for that long, did he? You're right. He stepped down after just a few years, maybe because his interest shifted, we don't know for sure. But this opened the door for someone who would really make the Lucasian chair legendary, Isaac Newton. Ah, Newton. That name is, I mean it's synonymous with scientific genius. And what's fascinating is that he was elected to the Lucasian chair in 1669, like just a few years after his miracle years. Which for anyone who doesn't know is this period of intense intellectual productivity for him, where he developed his groundbreaking ideas on calculus, optics, and gravity. Right. Imagine being in Newton's shoes at that time. This young man just brimming with revolutionary ideas, stepping into this very prestigious role. It's almost as if like destiny had intervened. Right, I mean it really does feel like the perfect alignment of a brilliant mind with a platform designed to amplify groundbreaking ideas. And Newton, well, he didn't disappoint. He did not. During his time in the chair, he published two of the most important works in the history of science, Principia Mathematica and Optics. And I mean these books totally changed our understanding of the universe. He established the laws of motion, universal gravitation, laid the foundation for classical physics. And Newton's legacy just cast a long shadow on the Lucasian chair. Right. And in the years following him, many of the professors focused on translating and expanding upon his work. It's almost as if they were trying to decipher the secrets of a scientific oracle. Right. I mean it makes sense though, right? Newton's work was so transformative that it's, well of course, it became a focal point for those who came after. But as time went on, science itself started to change. So by the late 19th century, it wasn't just a domain of gentleman scholars anymore. It was really becoming, you know, a professionalized field. Exactly. And that shift is really mirrored in the history of the Lucasian chair. Like take Robert Woodhouse, for instance. He held the chair in the early 1820s and used it, well, basically as a stepping stone to secure the Plumean chair of mathematics. And also the directorship of the Cambridge Observatory. So even back then, the Lucasian chair was kind of a launchpad to even bigger things within the scientific community. Absolutely. And then there's Thomas Turton, who succeeded Woodhouse. He was described, well someone said he was mathematically inert but utterly reliable. Okay. Not exactly the qualities we associate with Newton's legacy, you know. It's a bit of a contrast, yeah. Yeah. But it sounds like Turton's ambitions were maybe elsewhere. You're right. He left the Lucasian chair for the more prestigious Regis chair of divinity and eventually became the Bishop of Eli. Wow. From math professor to bishop. That's quite a leap. It is. It shows that the Lucasian chair wasn't always just about groundbreaking mathematical research. But it also became a mark of distinction, like a symbol of intellectual prowess that could open doors in other fields. It speaks to the power and prestige associated with the position. You know, even for those who didn't make like significant contributions to mathematics while they were in the chair, holding that title carried a certain weight. Right. A recognition of intellectual capability. And, you know, it makes you wonder about the kind of pressure that came with the role. I mean, to follow in the footsteps of giants like Newton, knowing that the whole world was watching, expecting brilliance. Yeah. I mean, it must have been pretty daunting for some. Oh, I bet it was. But as the scientific world kept evolving, so did the work of the Lucasian professors. So moving into the 20th century, we see the chair occupied by figures who were, you know, really pushing the boundaries of entirely new fields like quantum mechanics and cosmology. OK, so this is where it gets really interesting for me. Quantum mechanics. Cosmology. We're talking about some mind bending concepts here. I mean, things that challenge our whole understanding of reality. Right, exactly. And one of the pioneers in these fields was Paul Dirac, who held the Lucasian chair from 1932 to 1969. He was renowned for, well, a lot of things, but his work on the electron. And he predicted the existence of antimatter. Antimatter. So like particles with opposite charges to the ones that we know. It's like a mirror image of our universe. And Dirac, I mean, it's incredible. He predicted this just through theoretical calculation, years before experimental physicists were able to confirm that it actually existed. I know, right? It's a testament to the power of mathematical reasoning. Right. That you can deduce the existence of something so fundamentally different from, you know, our everyday experience. And it's all through the elegance of equations. And Dirac was, well, he was very committed to this elegance. He believed that the laws of nature should be expressed in beautiful mathematical formulations. It's a beautiful idea. I mean, it's almost like he saw this poetic symmetry in the universe. Right. Like a deep harmony reflected in the language of math. And speaking of people who changed our understanding of the universe, we can't forget about Stephen Hawking, of course. He held the Lucasian chair for three decades, from 1979 to 2009. Right. Hawking's work on black holes and cosmology was, I mean, it was groundbreaking. He brought these complex concepts to, you know, a wider audience through his book, A Brief History of Time. And it's just amazing to think that he made such profound contributions while, well, you know, facing such immense physical challenges. It's amazing. A testament to his spirit and intellectual resilience. And you know what I find interesting about Hawking is that he himself acknowledged the weight of history that came with the Lucasian chair. Yeah. I mean, he joked about it. He said he was just a stopgap professor. Like he didn't expect to be there for so long. Yeah, he did. And he also expressed a hope that, you know, one day the chair might be held by someone, a scientist who wasn't affiliated with Cambridge at all. Like breaking that tradition of it always being a Cambridge graduate. Yeah. He saw the potential in broadening, you know, the scope of who holds that Lucasion professorship. Right. That's forward thinking for sure. Recognizing that groundbreaking ideas can come from anywhere. Yeah. But of course, he held the position for 30 years, which in itself is a testament to his impact on the world of science. Absolutely. And following Hawking, there was Michael Green who held the chair from 2009 to 2015. Okay. He made a long-term contribution to mathematics, pioneering string theory. Ah, yes. Which for anyone who doesn't know, attempts to unify all of the forces of nature. Wow. A truly ambitious undertaking. Yeah. I mean, it sounds like every single Lucasion professor brought, well, their own unique perspective and expertise to the role. Pushing the boundaries of mathematical knowledge in, you know, different ways. Exactly. And that brings us to today. The current Lucasion professor is Michael Cates, who specializes in the statistical mechanics of soft materials. Soft materials. What are those? It might sound kind of abstract, but soft materials are, well, they're all around us. Think about things like mayonnaise, shaving cream, shampoo. Even those liquid crystals that are in, you know, flat screen TVs. Cates' work is all about understanding the, well, the complex behavior of these materials, but at, you know, a microscopic level. So he's applying, like, high-level mathematics to, I don't know, everyday things. Right. It's kind of a reminder that math isn't just about abstract equations, but it's, you know, it's a tool for
