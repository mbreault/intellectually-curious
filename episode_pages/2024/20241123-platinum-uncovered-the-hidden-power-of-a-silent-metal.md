## Transcript

Hey everyone and welcome to this deep dive into the world of platinum. You've given us a really interesting mix of articles and research material for this one. So it seems like you're interested in really getting the full picture here. Yeah, the whole story. Not just the surface level stuff about platinum. Get ready for some surprises. Because today we're going to uncover the hidden depths of this precious metal. It's so much more than just jewelry and cars. Absolutely. And you know what's really fascinating to me is that the sources you sent in really highlight a desire to understand not just like the what's of platinum, but the why. Like why it matters, why it's used in so many different ways, and why it holds such a unique position in our world. You really want to know like what makes it tick. Yeah. Okay, so before we get ahead of ourselves, let's start with the basics. What exactly is platinum? Platinum is an element. It's a silvery white metal. It's incredibly dense. And it has an extremely high melting point. Oh, wow. Yeah, and it's also surprisingly scarce. Really? We're talking like 0.005 parts per million in the Earth's crust. Whoa. To put that in perspective, imagine trying to find like a single grain of sand on an entire beach. Wow. It's that rare. So if I were holding a platinum bar, like it would feel a lot heavier. Yeah, a lot heavier than you'd think. Than I'd expect for sure. Yeah, and it's that density combined with its resistance to corrosion and its high melting point. Yeah. That makes platinum so valuable. Makes sense. For so many things. I'm starting to see why it's not just about sparkle and shine with platinum. Exactly. But before we jump into all the amazing ways it's used, I'm seeing some really interesting historical stuff here. Oh, yeah. Something about pre-Columbian cultures working with platinum. Yes, it's really quite remarkable. Tell me more about that. So long before Europeans knew about platinum, cultures in South America were already using it in their gold artifacts. Really? They had techniques to work with it, even with its super high melting point. That's amazing. Yeah. I never knew platinum had such a long history. A really rich history. Wow. And then the Spanish conquistadors came along. Oh, yeah. And they basically thought it was a nuisance. It's almost comical. Really? You know these conquistadors? Yeah. They were so focused on gold that they dismissed platinum. Wow. They thought it was like an impurity. No way. They even had this decree forbidding people from mixing gold with platinum. Oh, my gosh. Like adulterating the gold. Could you imagine? If they only knew then what we know now about platinum. They would be kicking themselves. Oh, absolutely. For throwing away what could have been a fortune. Exactly. Their loss is our gain, though, right? Exactly right. So how did platinum go from being tossed aside to being treasured? It took a while for European scientists to really see its potential. You know that high melting point made it really difficult to work with. Oh, I bet. For decades, they were baffled by it. Really? Some even thought it was like this strange hardened mercury. Wow. So who were the pioneers who finally unlocked the secrets of platinum? Well, there were a few key figures. Okay. In the 1700s, there was this Spanish scientist, Antonio de Ulloa, who really brought platinum to the attention of Europe. Gotcha. And then you have Charles Wood and William Branrigg, English scientists, who did some of the early investigations into its properties. Wow. And let's not forget Henrik Scheffer. Oh, right. That Swedish chemist who figured out how to melt platinum using arsenic. Yeah. Pretty risky technique. Very risky. If you ask me. Yeah. And then in the late 1700s, we have Pierre-Francois Chabonneau, this French chemist. He finally cracked the code of creating pure, malleable platinum. Wow. This was a huge breakthrough. I bet. It ushered in a platinum age in Spain where they used platinum to make everything from ingots and coins to really elaborate utensils for the royal court. So platinum went from being tossed back into rivers to being fit for a king. It's a real glow-up. Talk about a glow-up. Yeah. I'm guessing its story doesn't end there, though. No, not at all. There's more to platinum than just its historical journey. Absolutely. Platinum's real claim to fame is in how incredibly versatile it is and those unique properties that make it so valuable. Makes sense. In so many applications. From medicine to clean energy to even... What? Airbags. Wait, platinum is in airbags. You got it. Okay, now I'm really intrigued. Tell me more about these unexpected uses. This is where it gets really interesting for me. So one of the most impressive applications is in cancer treatment. Really? Platinum compounds like cisplatin are used in chemotherapy to fight certain types of cancer. Cisplatin, I've heard that name before, but I never really understood how it works. So imagine like these tiny platinum warriors going into battle against the cancer cells. Gotcha. That's essentially what cisplatin does. It disrupts the cancer cells' ability to replicate and spread. So it stops them from growing. Exactly. Wow. That's incredible. Yeah, it's a really powerful tool. It's amazing to think that platinum plays such a crucial role in saving lives. It really does. But you mentioned airbags. I did. What's the connection there? Platinum cured silicones are used in airbags to keep them stable and safe for a really long time. So next time I get in my car, a tiny bit of platinum is helping to keep me safe. That's right. Wow, that's mind-boggling. Platinum is literally woven into our everyday lives without us even realizing it. It really is. And what about fuel cells? Oh, yeah. I know those are a big deal in the clean energy world. They are. What's platinum's role there? So platinum plays a crucial role in fuel cell technology. It acts as a catalyst. A catalyst? Yeah, it's like a chemical matchmaker. Gotcha. It helps facilitate the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity. And the best part is? The only byproduct is water. Whoa. So it's a truly clean energy source. Exactly. So platinum is helping us move towards a more sustainable future. It really is. That's fantastic. Yeah. But I'm seeing something here about fuel cells in South Africa. Yes. This is a really impactful story. Okay. They're using fuel cell mini grids powered by platinum to bring electricity. Wow. To remote areas of South Africa. Really? That aren't connected to the main power grid. So we're talking about improving people's lives, bringing power to homes and schools. Exactly. And even boosting agriculture. Absolutely. In these communities, that's really inspiring. It really is. Platinum is quietly making a world of difference. And what's even more remarkable is that its journey is far from overplete. Okay. Platinum's versatility extends even further into the heart of modern industry and technology. Okay. I'm ready to hear more about that. But to fully appreciate its impact. Yeah. We need to understand how this once discarded metal became such an essential ingredient in our modern world. All right. Let's delve deeper. Let's do it. Okay. So we've gone from platinum being a nuisance to being used in cancer treatments and clean energy. Right. What other surprises does platinum have in store for us? Well, to understand platinum's modern day significance, we need to talk about catalysts. Catalysts. Okay. Refresh my memory on what those are exactly. Think of a catalyst as like a facilitator in a chemical reaction. It speeds things up without getting consumed itself. Okay. And platinum with its unique properties happens to be an exceptional catalyst. Right. We touched on its role as a catalyst in fuel cells earlier. Exactly. But where else do platinum catalysts play a big part? Let's start with something you probably use every day, your car. My car. Okay. Platinum is a key component of catalytic converters. Oh, yeah. You know those devices that help reduce harmful emissions from your car's exhaust. So every time I drive, platinum is quietly cleaning up my car's exhaust. That's pretty amazing. That's pretty cool. But it also makes me wonder if like every car on the road needs platinum, isn't that putting a huge strain on the supply? That's a great question. Yeah. And it really highlights the importance of responsible mining practices and recycling efforts. Right. Because it's so rare. Exactly. Platinum's scarcity means we need to be mindful how we use it. Absolutely. It sounds like recycling platinum is going to become even more important in the future. For sure. But getting back to its uses. Okay. You mentioned it's not just in cars, right? You got it. Platinum's versatility extends to all sorts of electronics. Electronics like what? Computer hard drives. Okay. Spark plugs. Uh-huh. Even those LCD screens we're all glued to. Wait, platinum is in LCD screens? Exactly. I had no idea. Yeah. So every time you binge watch your favorite show, you're staring at a piece of this rare metal. That's wild. And its uses go beyond just industry and technology. Right. Platinum is also a precious metal commodity. Yeah. Traded in the form of coins and bars just like gold. Just like gold. Oh, right. I've heard of platinum bullion. Yeah. But honestly, I'm not really sure how that whole investment side of things works. Well, just like gold, platinum's rarity and its inherent value make it really attractive for investors. Gotcha. It's often seen as a safe haven asset. A safe haven asset. A way to diversify a portfolio and potentially hedge against economic uncertainty. So it's like when the stock market is
