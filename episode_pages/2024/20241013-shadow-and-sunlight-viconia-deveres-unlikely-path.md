## Description

Explore the life of Viconia Devere, a drow cleric who defies her brutal Underdark origins to walk the surface world. We trace her defiance of Loth in Menzo-Baerenzan, her shift to Shar, and the misadventures that mark her journeyâ€”pulling from Forgotten Realms and Baldurâ€™s Gate lore to unpack the contradictions, loyalties, and survival instincts that define her.

## Transcript

All right, buckle up, because today we are diving into the life of a character who's practically made of contradictions. Viconia Devere. Viconia Devere. Yeah, we're talking about a drow. A drow. Cleric, but not just any cleric, this one. She walks the surface world. Oh, okay. Now that's interesting. See, for anyone who's spent even five minutes with the Forgotten Realms, you know that's about as likely as, well, I don't know, finding a polar bear in a desert. Right. It's just not something you see every day. Exactly. Drow are practically infamous for their, shall we say, fondness for darkness. Oh, yeah. And I mean that in every sense. Literally holing themselves up in the Underdark and then figuratively dedicating themselves to Loth, the Spider Queen. Of course. Not exactly the type you'd invite to a picnic, are they? Not unless you're serving, like, venom tea and spider-shaped sandwiches, maybe? Right. So to have a drow, and a cleric no less, not just surviving but practically thriving under the open sky. Well, that's the kind of story we can't resist digging into. And the best part, we've got some juicy sources to pull from. Excerpts from both the Forgotten Realms wiki and the Baldur's Gate wiki are giving us all the inside scoops on her life, her choices. And knowing Viconia, probably a few choice words for anyone who crosses her. Oh, you know there are going to be some cutting remarks in there somewhere. In fact, I think I saw a quote somewhere. It was something like, there's no roof to this world. Oh, classic Viconia. You can practically hear the sarcasm dripping off those words. Totally. But to really get Viconia to understand what makes her tick, we got to go back to where it all began. Take us there. Menzo Baranzen. Picture, if you will, Drow Central. We're talking a city where betrayal is like a national sport, spire webs are considered high fashion, and if you're not ruthless, well, you're basically spider chow. It's true. Menzo Baranzen is a brutal place, a city ruled by fear, and of course, that ever-present shadow of Loth. Oh, yeah. Can't forget about Loth. No, you really can't. Drow society is a strange and terrifying thing, especially for a surface dwellers. And their treatment of women, well, it's complicated. How? On the surface, you might think, oh, women hold all the power. And they do, in a way. But always, always under the thumb of Loth, who demands absolute, unquestioning obedience. And we've heard how Loth likes to show her appreciation. Let's just say it's not exactly with a gift basket. Not even close. Often, it involves rather intense sacrifices. So the question is, how does someone like Viconia emerge from that pressure cooker of a city? Yeah, it'd be like trying to grow a sunflower in a cave. Completely against the odds. And yet, Viconia's story takes this fascinating turn. The sources point to this really pivotal moment in her life early on. She's a priestess of Loth, right? Okay. And she's ordered to carry out a ritual. A sacrifice. Go on. An infant. An infant. I mean, that's chilling, even for the Drow. Exactly. And despite that upbringing, that brutal, unforgiving environment, Viconia, she refused. Wow. She just flat out said no to Loth. She couldn't go through with it. Yeah. Couldn't bring herself to do it. And that act of defiance, that tiny flicker of compassion, it set off a chain reaction that she could have never predicted. Talk about a ripple effect. It's like she poked a hornet's nest with a stick. Essentially, yeah. Her house, House Devere, they fell out of favor with Loth immediately. Oh, no. And when I say out of favor, I mean, imagine the most unforgiving queen in the universe scorned. They tried everything to claw their way back. Desperately. They even made sacrifices. But Loth only wanted one thing. You got it. Viconia herself. Exactly. Even Viconia's own mother, she was ready to hand her over just to appease Loth, to get back in her good graces. That's... I mean, talk about cold-hearted. What kind of devotion or maybe fear makes you sacrifice your own child for power? It's a terrifying thought. But Viconia had one saving grace. Her brother, Balas. Oh, Balas. He stepped in to save her, right? He did. Made the ultimate sacrifice, in fact. But in a city like Menzo-Berenzan, where even thinking about defying Loth is basically a death sentence, it couldn't have gone well for him. No, definitely not. So what happened? Balas was transformed. Turned into a drider. Oh, no, a drider. That's... that's awful. It's a horrifying mix of drow and spider. All for the crime of protecting his sister. Talk about a raw deal. It doesn't get much worse than that. So now you've got Viconia, stripped of her powers, branded a traitor, and facing, what, certain death, or worse, if she stays in Menzo-Berenzan? Pretty much. She had one option left. The surface. The surface world. Can you imagine a lifetime spent in the Underdark, and suddenly she's thrust into a world bathed in sunlight? Talk about culture shock. Must have felt like stepping onto another planet entirely. So that's it, right? She sees the light, both literally and figuratively, and joins the good guys. You'd think that's how it would go, wouldn't you? But with Viconia Devere, things are never that simple. Oh, I have a feeling it's about to get interesting. Oh, it does. Because on the surface, Viconia finds herself a new patron, a new deity to follow. Shar, the goddess of darkness, of loss, of secrets. Hold on. She trades Loth for Shar. That's not exactly a total 180, is it? That's putting it mildly. And that's where things get really interesting, because with that choice, we have to ask, what does it really mean to embrace Shar? And what does it tell us about Viconia Devere? So we've got this drow cleric, right? Fresh out of the Underdark, probably still getting used to the feeling of sunlight. And instead of, I don't know, finding the nearest temple of good-aligned deity, she goes and pledges herself to Shar. Yeah, you gotta wonder what's going on in that head of hers, right? But here's the thing. She doesn't just become some meek follower of Shar, content to, like, meditate in the shadows or whatever. Our sources paint a picture of Viconia's surface life that's less finding enlightenment and more... Well, imagine a drow trying to hail a taxi in a rainstorm. It's just one mishap after another. Okay, I got here. What kind of mishaps are we talking? Give me the good stuff. All right, well, first off, she gets captured. Captured? By who? A Calishite caravan. Oh, no, those guys. They're not exactly known for their five-star accommodations. Not exactly. They're traders, right? And a lot of their business goes through the Underdark. So they probably weren't too shocked to see a drow. Though I'm sure Viconia wasn't exactly the friendliest passenger. I bet. And knowing Viconia, I doubt she just sat there quietly. So how'd she get out of that mess? Oh, she escaped. That's the Viconia guarantee. But not without some serious excitement. First, she gets chased by, get this, a band of goblins. Goblins. Really? They're not exactly known for their track of hair kills. What is this, amateur hour in the spine of the world? You'd think so, right? Right. But it gets better. Because then she gets chased by elves. Elves? Okay, hold on. We've got goblins. We've got elves. I don't know if I've ever seen those two groups working together. Was this some kind of bizarre Underdark peace treaty I haven't heard about? Your guess is as good as mine. All I know is, according to the sources, Viconia managed to evade them both. Which honestly is kind of impressive when you think about it. That's our girl. Always the survivor. But wait, there's more. Oh yeah, there's more. So picture this. Viconia's wandering through the countryside, probably trying to get as far away from any more goblins or elves as possible, and she bumps into this farmer. A farmer. Okay, that doesn't sound so bad. It wasn't at first. This poor guy. He meant well, but well, you try explaining to a surface dweller that the drow lady in front of you doesn't need to be buried alive for her own good. Wait, seriously. He tried to bury her alive. That's what the sources say. Seems the poor guy panicked a little, didn't quite know what to do with a drow just showing up on his land. I mean, can you blame him? It's not every day a drow comes knocking. Literally. So how did Viconia get out of that one? Oh, she did what any resourceful drow cleric would do. She turned the tables. Let's just say that farmer didn't need his crops fertilized anymore. Oh my gosh. Okay, that's dark. Even for Viconia. Yeah. But also kind
