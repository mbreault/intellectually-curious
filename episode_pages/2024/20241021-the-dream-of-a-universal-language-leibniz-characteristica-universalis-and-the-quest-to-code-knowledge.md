## Description

A deep dive into Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's grand projectâ€”the Characteristica Universalisâ€”an attempt to express logic, math, science, and even metaphysics with a single symbolic language. We trace its roots, why it remained unfinished, its influence on modern formal systems (from Boolean algebra to UML and ISO symbols), and the surprising GÃ¶del connection that keeps the dream alive today.

## Transcript

Okay, so are you ready for a real deep dive this time? We're going deep into the mind of, well, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. You know him, right? The calculus guy. Pretty much invented it. But get this, math. That was like his side hustle? Wow. Leibniz had this like way bigger dream, this universal language. Called it the Characteristica Universalis. So what's wild about this is he wasn't just trying to make like another Esperanto. He thought we could have a system where logic, math, you name it, even metaphysics could be like expressed with totally like mathematical equations. Hold on, are we talking about like ditching debates and just using equations instead? It was a different time back then. 17th century, tons of new science, philosophy debates everywhere. Right. He wanted to cut through all that, find a common language for knowledge, you know? So instead of arguing, we could, what, calculate the truth? Yeah. That's a lot. Where do you even get that idea? Okay, this is interesting. He got it from Chinese characters. Yeah. Leibniz was like obsessed with how those symbols worked, how they had meaning. I mean, I get it. A picture's a picture, right? Doesn't matter what you call it. Exactly. But he wanted to go further than those systems. Bolder. More rational, more efficient. A real alphabet of human thought, he called it. So not just like philosophy stuff. This was for science too. Oh, totally. Imagine scientists from all over different languages and all that sharing discoveries with this universal system, diagrams, symbols, the whole deal. Wow. That's huge. A universal language of science. It's like elegant math, but for everything we know. Yeah, yeah. Did he like ever actually do it though? Okay, so this is where it gets cool. Okay. Leibniz used diagrams to explain his own philosophy, right? One example, there's this diamond shape. Okay. Represents the four elements, earth, water, air, fire, the classics. I'm with you. And the diamond shows how they all connect. I need the visual, break it down. Okay, so picture it, right? Each corner is an element. Lines between them, some are contraries, earth, air, opposites. Gotcha. Others are possible combinations like air and fire. Makes sense. It's showing relationships visually. So this was like him testing out the characteristic. Kinda, showing how it could work for complex ideas. But come on, a system for all knowledge, that's gotta be impossible. Ambitious, for sure. More than ambitious. He figured it'd take like a whole team of geniuses five years, minimum. Five years with a dream team, maybe? Yeah. Even that feels, I don't know, optimistic. Right, and even he started to realize how big it was. Oh yeah. Later on, he was like, I might not actually finish this. So did he create this language or was it all just talk? That's the thing, we haven't found a full system anywhere in his published stuff. So it's, what, lost? A big secret? We know he left behind thousands of pages of notes, manuscripts, all that. Okay, so like hidden away somewhere? Possibly, but more likely if there's a complete system, it's spread through all those writings. Talk about a research project. Right. But if no one's found it, how do we even know about the Characteristica? He wrote about it a lot. He really believed in it, even if he couldn't make it a reality. A real dream project. Yeah, and it got other people thinking too. Like who? Well, there are theories, right? About what happened to his work. Oh, conspiracy stuff. I'm listening. Maybe a little bit. Some think the Characteristica or parts of it got, I don't know, suppressed. Suppressed? Like it was dangerous. Or just too radical at the time, maybe. I mean, I can kind of see it, right? Trying to systematize everything. Sure. That's putting it lightly. But people back then, they must have had some reactions, right? Oh, for sure. Some are like, this is never going to work, called it absurdly optimistic. Can you blame them? But then you have someone like Kurt GÃ¶del. Hold on, the Kurt GÃ¶del. Yeah. Mr. Logic himself. Yeah, he thought it was not only possible but revolutionary. Okay, now I need to know more about GÃ¶del and this whole thing. It's really interesting. He was convinced, even without a complete system from Leibniz. If he was so sure, why didn't he just like finish it himself? Well, remember those thousands of pages I mentioned? The manuscripts, right? He thought those held the key, the missing pieces. So he thought there was something there. Exactly. He even thought maybe there was a conspiracy, you know, to keep it hidden. Like people wanted the Characteristica buried. It's a theory, but it shows how big these ideas were, how knowledge can be lost, I guess. Wild. Okay, but even if he never like finished it, Leibniz's work had to have some impact, right? Oh, absolutely. It's like ripples through history. You see it everywhere. Okay, I'm ready for specifics. Hit me with the Leibniz legacy. All right, so there's John Wilkins, right? 17th century, obsessed with philosophical language. Sounds familiar. Right. He even thought making a thesaurus was a step towards it. So Leibniz wasn't alone in wanting this universal language thing? Not at all. And even if they didn't crack the code, they laid the groundwork. Take Boolean algebra, group theory. Math stuff. Not my forte. But it's all about using those methods to understand like everything, not just numbers. Kind of like Leibniz wanted to do with the Characteristica. Exactly. And then there's, you know, how we formalize scientific theories now. Formalize, like rules and stuff. Yeah, axiomatic systems. Sounds intense. Think of it like you're building something. You need a solid base, right? That's your axioms. From those, you figure out everything else in that system, logically. So it's all connected, built up solid, like a knowledge framework. Right. Leibniz wanted that for science, clear, precise, everyone on the same page. It's crazy how these old ideas still matter today. We still want to connect everything, communicate better. Totally. And there's more. These little echoes of the Characteristica, even if people don't realize it. Oh, like what? I'm hooked now. Okay, so there's this guy, O.L. Reiser. He wrote about unified symbolism in science. Straight up inspired by Leibniz. Then there's Fernley Sander. He said Leibniz's vision with the logic and geometry, it predicted modern algebra even. And even Gottlob Frege, the logic guy. Some say he got ideas from Leibniz. Wow, okay, Leibniz is way more influential than I thought. Right. Makes you wonder what if he'd had today's tech, the computers, all that. He'd probably be running some crazy AI program to make the Characteristica. It's nuts to think about. But let's be real for a sec. Do you think a universal language like that is even possible? That's the big question, right? I mean, think about how complex human thought is, all the different cultures, everything. It's a lot to try and put in one system. Exactly. But then we've got computer languages, right? Those are pretty complex. Sure. And science that's shared globally, somehow it works. It makes you think maybe it's not about replacing language. Right. More like enhancing it, making tough ideas easier to, I don't know, grasp, share around. Yeah, build those bridges instead of one big impossible language. Exactly. And there are real examples. Look at the ISO. The what? International Organization for Standardization. They make those like universal symbols, scientific terms, that kind of thing. So we do have a universal language just for like practical stuff. Right. You know a fire extinguisher is a fire extinguisher no matter where you are. Exactly. Makes sense. What else? Think about software engineering. They use UML, Unified Modeling Language. Never heard of it. It's how they make diagrams for software no matter the code. So like a visual language for programmers. Basically. Makes it way easier to work together even if they don't speak the same language literally. So maybe that's it, right? Smaller characteristicas but for specific things. Maybe that is more realistic instead of one system for everything you focus on where it's most useful right now. I like it. So even if we never find Leibniz's big invention. Yeah. It's like the idea itself pushed us in the right direction anyway. 100%. Logic, language, how we organize information. It's all connected to that push for a better system. So maybe Leibniz's biggest impact wasn't the language itself. But the impact on how people thought about language. Yeah. Like inspiring generations to try and make sense of the world more logically, more connected. It's incredible. One idea even unfinished can do all that. It really is. Makes you wonder though. What would Leibniz be dreaming up today? With our tech, I mean. Oh man, now that's a thought, right? What would his characteristica look like in the age of the internet, AI, all that? It's a good question for, I don't know, the comments maybe? What do you think, listeners? Could we ever bridge those gaps? Language, culture, knowledge? It's a tall order. But hey, maybe that's the point, right? It's the striving for it that matters. Anyway, that's our deep dive for today.
