Join us for a thorough look at radon: what it is, where it comes from, and why it matters for homes, health, and science. We cover the Watchers incident, the evolution of radon in medicine, the main risksâ€”especially lung cancerâ€”plus the useful scientific roles radon plays in hydrology and early earthquake research. We'll also explain isotopes, half-life, and practical steps to reduce radon in your living spaces.

## Transcript

Hey everyone, welcome back. Today we're doing a deep dive into radon. Radon. You sent over some really interesting sources. We have a scientific overview. We have a really in-depth Wikipedia entry. And then something about like radon's discovery. Wow. So we're going to synthesize all this information and hopefully help you become a radon aficionado. Sounds good. I think everyone kind of knows about radon, but they think it's like a basement problem, right? Yeah, it's definitely known for being a basement problem, but there's a lot more to it. Right. I think to start, we have to answer the basic question, what is radon? Okay, what is it? So radon is a chemical element. Okay. You can find it on the periodic table. Okay. It's element number 86. Oh, wow. And it's represented by the symbol RN. Now what makes radon unique is that it's a noble gas, meaning it's not very reactive, and it's naturally radioactive. Oh, okay. So it's a gas and it's radioactive. Yes. That sounds a little scary. Yeah, I mean, the radioactivity is where things get interesting. Right. It's actually a decay product of radium, which itself comes from uranium. So it's constantly being formed as these elements decay. Okay. And uranium and thorium, those are the elements that radium and radon come from. They're present in rocks and soil pretty much everywhere. So it's forming everywhere. So like right now under our feet, radon is forming. To a degree, yes. Okay. I mean, the good news is that outdoors, it's usually at very low levels because it's diluted in the open air. Okay. But when you get into enclosed spaces, you know, that's where things can get a bit dicey. Right, yeah. You know, it can seep into buildings from the ground below, especially basements, and you can even find it in well water. Right. So it's really, I think that's where the basement problem comes from. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so you sent over these sources and you mentioned this thing called the Watchers incident. Can you tell me a little bit about that? Yes, the Watchers incident. That was actually a pivotal moment in the understanding of radon risks. It involved a guy named Stanley Watchers. Okay. He was a worker at a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, and he kept setting off the radiation alarms at work. At a nuclear power plant? At a nuclear power plant. But here's the thing. Okay. The plant wasn't even operational yet. What? Yeah, so they were really confused. Why is this guy setting off the alarms? Right. And so they finally traced the source of the contamination back to his house. Oh, so he was bringing something home from work, like on his clothes or something. Not at all. It turned out that his basement had incredibly high radon levels. Oh, wow. Like exceeding 100,000 becquerels per cubic meter. Okay. 100,000. I have no idea what that means. I mean, to give you some context, the EPA recommends taking action to reduce radon starting at 74 becquerels per cubic meter. Oh, wow. So his house was like off the charts. That's crazy. So, I mean, it's just this invisible gas that could be a real threat. Yeah. Okay, so you mentioned that it comes from uranium decay. Do people ever think that radon was, like, good for you? Believe it or not, yes. Early in the 20th century, people actually used it in medical treatments. What? Yeah, they would take radon baths for things like arthritis. Radon baths. Radon baths. And it was even used in some early forms of radiotherapy. That's crazy. What was the thinking behind that? Like, why would they think that? Well, back then, they were just starting to explore, you know, the therapeutic potential of radiation. Okay. And they thought that low doses of radiation from radon could actually have some beneficial effects. Okay. But as research progressed, it became clear that any perceived benefits were far outweighed by the risks of radon exposure. Right. So, yeah, the radon bath craze didn't last too long. Okay. So what are, like, the main risks? I think everyone knows about lung cancer. Yeah. But is there more to it than that? Well, lung cancer is definitely the most serious risk, especially for smokers. Right. The EPA estimates that thousands of lung cancer deaths each year in the U.S. are attributed to radon exposure. Wow. Okay. And there are some studies that suggest a possible connection between radon and leukemia as well, although more research is needed to confirm that link. Okay. So it's definitely something to be concerned about. But, you know, before we get to doom and gloom, I have to ask, are there any good uses for radon today? Well, it might surprise you, but yes. Radon actually has some valuable applications in science. Okay. So it's not all bad? Not all bad. For instance, it's a very useful tool in hydrology. Hydrology. So hydrology, that's the study of water. Oh. So because radon is a gas, it moves very easily through cracks and pores in rocks and soil. Okay. Which allows scientists to use it as a tracer to track the movement of groundwater. Oh, so like they put it in the water and then can see where the water goes. Yeah. It's like following a tiny, invisible, radioactive breadcrumb trail. Okay, that's really cool. And here's where it gets even more interesting. Some researchers are exploring radon's potential for, wait for it, earthquake prediction. Earthquake prediction. Wow. I did not see that coming. How does that even work? The idea is that the stress and strain on rocks before an earthquake could actually release radon gas. Okay. From deep within the earth. And by monitoring changes in radon levels, scientists hope to develop an early warning system for earthquakes. Oh, wow. That would be huge. Yeah. It has the potential to be revolutionary. But it's important to note that the research is still in its early stages. Right. You know, there have been some encouraging studies that showed spikes in radon levels before certain earthquakes. But there have also been cases where radon levels didn't change or they changed for other reasons entirely. Okay, so it's still kind of a mystery, but a really cool mystery. It's a complex puzzle that scientists are still trying to solve. Right. Okay. Well, I think that's a great place to wrap up part one of our radon deep dive. I agree. We'll be back in a moment to continue our exploration of this fascinating element. Sounds good. Welcome back. Right before the break, we were talking about how radon could be used to track groundwater and maybe even predict earthquakes. Yeah, it's amazing how something that can be so harmful can also be used in these, like, really cool ways. Totally. It really shows how complex elements can be and how much our understanding of them can change over time. Absolutely. Radon's story is, like, a perfect example of that. Okay, so let's dive into some of those fascinating properties of radon that you mentioned earlier. One thing that really jumped out at me in the sources was just how many different isotopes of radon there are. Ah, yes, the isotopes. So can you remind us what isotopes are? Sure. So isotopes are basically different versions of the same element. They have the same number of protons, which is what defines an element, but a different number of neutrons. And that means they have different atomic masses. Got it. Some isotopes are stable, while others are radioactive, meaning they decay over time and release radiation. Right, right, like the different flavors of radon. So how many radon isotopes are there? Well, there are 39 known radioactive radon isotopes. 39. 39. But don't worry, only a handful occur naturally. Okay, that's good to know. And the one we're usually most concerned about when we talk about radon risks is radon-222. Radon-222. It's the most stable of the radon isotopes with a half-life of about 3.8 days. Half-life. Now there's a term I haven't heard in a while. Oh, yeah. Can you refresh my memory on what that means? Of course. So the half-life is basically the time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay. Okay. So for radon-222, if you start with, say, 100 atoms, after 3.8 days you'll have about 50 left. After another 3.8 days, you'll be down to about 25 and so on. Got it. Got it. Okay, so some isotopes decay super quickly and some take a really long time. What about those isotopes with super short half-lives? Do they pose any risk? Not really. I mean, the ones with half-lives measured in seconds or milliseconds decay almost instantly. So they don't stick around long enough to cause any problems. It's those longer-lived isotopes like radon-222 that we need to pay attention to. So it's mostly radon-222 that's contributing to those health risks we talked about earlier. Exactly. It's the one that tends to build up in homes and can be the biggest threat to our health. Right. But speaking of radon-222, did you know that it actually plays a role in something called radioactive dating? Radioactive dating. Oh, yeah. Doesn't that have something to do with figuring out how old ancient artifacts are? That's right. It's a technique used in archaeology and geology to estimate the age of materials, and it relies on the predictable decay of radioactive isotopes
