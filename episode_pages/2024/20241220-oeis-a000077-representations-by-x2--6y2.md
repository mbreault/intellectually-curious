## Description

We explore OEIS A000077, the sequence counting how many integers up to 2^n can be written as x^2 + 6y^2. We'll look at a concrete example, examine the first terms, and see how a simple quadratic form connects to broader ideas in number theoryâ€”quadratic forms, Landau-type results, and the way OEIS groups related sequences into families. A peek at the PRI code snippet showing how to generate more terms.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into the OEIS. The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. You got it. Yeah. It's always exciting to kind of see what's next. What's a new sequence will hold for us. And today we're looking at 000077. Ah, yes. This one's interesting. Yeah, it's a little... Deceptively simple at first. Yeah, it seems that way. But it leads you to some pretty interesting math. Okay. The sequence itself deals with counting positive integers less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of n that can be expressed in this form. x squared plus 6 times y squared. So we're looking for numbers that fit a certain mold? Yeah, you could say that. We're given a range to work with. Right. And we want to see how many numbers in that range can be formed using this specific combination of squares. Using this formula. Yeah. And the source actually gives a good example to illustrate it. Okay. If we take n to be 3, then 2 to the 3rd power is 8. 8. So we're looking at the integers from 1 to 8. Okay, so we're going through all the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Yep. And we're going to see which of those can be expressed as x squared plus 6 times y squared. Right. And if you go through it, only 4 of those numbers fit the pattern. 1, 4, 6, and 7. Okay. You can kind of verify that for yourself by just plugging in different numbers for x and y. Okay. For instance, 1 can be represented as 1 squared, 4 as 2 squared, 6 as 6 times 1 squared, and 7 as 1 squared plus 6 times 1 squared. Okay, so this example gives us the third term in the sequence. Yes. A of 3 equals 4. Exactly. And the OEIS entry actually gives us the first 36 terms. It does. So you can start to see how the sequence unfolds. You can see where it's going, yeah. And there's a snippet of PRI code. Right. Which can be really useful if you want to explore it further. Yeah, if you want to play around with it and generate some more terms yourself. It's like having a mathematical recipe. Exactly. You can just plug in and... Plug and chug, yeah. Yeah, okay, so A000077. It's not just some obscure numerical thing. It's referenced in some pretty prominent works, like Sloan's Handbook of Integer Sequences. Right. And the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. It's a big deal. It's the real deal. It's got its own... It's got some street cred. Yeah, exactly. And it even has connections to it. Oh, yeah, this is where it gets really interesting. Okay. It's actually linked to research by Shanks and Schmid on variations of Landau's theorem. Now, this is where it gets really interesting for me. Yeah, Landau's theorem... We're seeing how it ties into these other concepts and theories. It deals with the distribution of prime numbers. Oh, wow. Okay. In certain arithmetic progressions. So A000077 is about this quadratic form. Right. But it's giving us insight into this whole other area of number theory. You got it. So it's like a bridge. It's like we stumbled upon a bridge between two different islands in this mathematical archipelago. We're connecting quadratic forms to the distribution of primes. That's really neat. Yeah, and that's just one example of the fascinating connections you find in the OEIS. Yeah. You start with a simple rule. Right. And before you know it... You're finding all these intricate relationships. You're uncovering all these crazy relationships between different areas of math. It's wild. It is pretty wild. Okay, so the source mentioned something called index entries for sequences related to populations of quadratic forms. Yes, yes. What can you tell me about that? So this shows how interconnected math concepts really are. Okay. The OEIS, it doesn't just catalog individual sequences. It also organizes them into families or groups based on shared properties. I see. So in this case, A000077 belongs to a group of sequences that all deal with counting the number of integers represented by different quadratic forms. So it's like we're zooming out from looking at a single species of plant to seeing a whole forest. Yeah, that's a great way to put it. Right, we're getting the broader context. Exactly. And by studying these related sequences, we can learn even more about the underlying principles that govern quadratic forms. Okay, so this has all got me thinking about quadratic forms. Sure. Can you remind us what those are? Oh, yeah. And why they're so important. Absolutely. Essentially, a quadratic form is a polynomial expression where the highest power of any variable is 2. So you'll often see terms like x squared, y squared, y psi, combined with some coefficients. So our A000077 is looking at the quadratic form x squared plus 6 times y squared. That's right. What's so special about that specific form? Well, the coefficients and the way the terms are arranged in a quadratic form really dictate its properties and how it behaves. And even changing just one coefficient can lead to a totally different sequence. It's kind of like a musical instrument. Oh, I like that. You know, the shape and size of the instrument. That's like the quadratic equation. Right. Determines the sounds it can make. Uh-huh. And the musician playing it. The input values. Right, that brings it to life. I love that analogy. So mathematicians can explore tons of different concepts. Oh, yeah. By looking at the intricacies of all these different quadratic forms. It's not just about the individual notes. Right. Or in our case, the individual sequences. Yeah. It's about understanding the underlying structure and the relationships between them. So it's like this giant jigsaw puzzle. Yes. And A000077 is just one piece. Exactly. And we're trying to see the bigger picture. And as we fit more pieces together, we start to see how complex and elegant the whole design is. Right. And who knows what kind of stunning image will emerge as we keep exploring this mathematical puzzle. I love that. The OEIS itself is kind of like a vast museum. Oh, yeah. With all these sequences. Each one's a unique artifact. We're not just looking at them. We're engaging with them. Exactly. We're trying to figure out what they mean. Right, and how they connect. Yeah, how they fit into the big story of math. It's a dynamic collection. It is. It keeps growing. Always evolving. New sequences and connections. And it's a testament to all the mathematicians who contribute to it. Contributing to this amazing resource. Yeah, it's pretty cool. So as we wrap up our deep dive on A000077 today, what are the key takeaways for our listeners? Well, I think this sequence is a great example of how interconnected math concepts can be. Okay. You know, it seems like a simple rule at first. Right. But then it links to things like Landau's theorem and the study of quadratic forms in general. It's amazing how these elementary ideas can have such profound implications. Yeah, you never know where they'll lead. And the P-R-I-I code snippet. Right. That's a powerful tool. It is. Let's us generate terms and look for patterns. It's like having a high-powered lens to zoom in on these numerical structures. Okay, and you mentioned the coefficients in the quadratic forms. Yes, those are crucial. Changing just one can lead to a completely different sequence. So many possibilities. An endless landscape of sequences to explore. And that brings us to a final thought for our listeners. Okay, hit me with it. What if we took that coefficient in A000077? The 6 in x squared plus 6 times y squared. Yeah, and we changed it. How would that change the sequence? That's a great question. Would we see similar patterns? Or something totally new? It's like we've been handed a map to uncharted territory. And we get to choose our own adventure. I love that. It's the beauty of math. The thrill of discovery. And the endless pursuit of knowledge. Well said. Thanks for joining us on this deep dive into the fascinating world of integer sequences. That's been a pleasure. We hope you'll continue to explore the OEIS and see where your own curiosity leads you. And who knows what amazing discoveries you might make. Until next time.
