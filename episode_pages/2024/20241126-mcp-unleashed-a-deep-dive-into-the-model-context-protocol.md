## Description

We explore MCPâ€”the Model Context Protocolâ€”a secure, client-server approach that lets AI tools access your local data, code, and tools while guarding privacy. From Claude Desktop to Zed and Sourcegraph Cody, we walk through how MCP works with a SQLite example, discuss practical use cases, and cover the safety boundaries that keep your data under your control.

## Transcript

Hey everyone and welcome back. Today we're going to be taking a deep dive into something that's got the potential to completely change the way we use AI. For sure. The model context protocol, or as the cool kids call it, MCP. MCP, yeah. So I think a lot of people, you know, when they use AI tools today, they kind of feel limited. Right. It's like they're stuck in their own little world. Totally. And MCP is all about breaking down those walls, right? It's like giving your AI apps the key to all this amazing data and tools that they couldn't access before. Yeah, exactly. And the thing that I find really exciting about this is that we're moving beyond just these generic AI responses. Right. With MCP, your AI can actually become an expert in your information. Okay. Whether it's your code, your research, your databases, like whatever you're working on. I'm intrigued already. So we're not just talking about getting like better answers from AI. Right. We're talking about giving AI the power to work with our stuff in a whole new way. Totally, totally. But before we get ahead of ourselves, like what exactly is MCP? Can you break that down? So imagine you have like an AI coding assistant, right? So it's great at suggesting code snippets, but it doesn't actually understand your project. Okay. Your style, the libraries you're using. MCP is like giving that AI assistant a backstage pass to all that context. It allows large language models, you know, those are like the brains behind all these AI tools, to tap into all that wealth of information that's actually relevant to you. So instead of just getting like generic suggestions, my AI tools can actually understand and work with like my projects, my files, even my databases. Exactly. That sounds incredibly powerful, but I got to admit, I'm also a little nervous about giving AI that much access. Is it really safe? Yeah. I mean, that's a valid concern for sure, but thankfully security is like baked into the core of MCP. And one of the ways it does this is using a client server architecture. Okay, client server, that sounds a little technical. Can you break that down? Absolutely. Yeah. So think of it like this. On one side, you have the MCP hosts. These are your applications. So like that AI coding assistant we were talking about. Got it. Or like a chat interface or even like some custom workflow that you've created. Okay. Right. They're the ones that want to tap into your data and tools. Okay. So those are the clients, right? Like they're the ones who want to access something. Exactly, yeah. What about the servers? What are they doing? Yeah. So the servers are like the gatekeepers. Okay. There are these lightweight programs that live on your machine and control access to specific resources. So for instance, if your coding assistant wants to query a local database, it would talk to a dedicated MCP server. Okay. That's specifically designed to handle database interactions. So it's like having like specialized translators for each type of data or tool. Just making sure everything's communicated properly and securely. But wait, if these servers are running on my machine, does that mean my data never leaves my computer? Exactly. That's one of the key security benefits of MCP. Okay. Your data doesn't get sent off to some remote server for processing. It stays right where it belongs, under your control. Okay, that definitely eases my mind a bit. But you know, this still raises the question, if I'm giving my AI access to like potentially sensitive stuff, my personal files, my financial data, how do I make sure it doesn't go snooping around where it shouldn't? Yeah, that's a great question. So MCP servers, they're designed with very specific capabilities. Okay. Right, so your database server can handle database interactions, but it can't touch your files. And even then, for any potentially sensitive operation, MCP requires your explicit confirmation. It's like setting boundaries. Your AI can only access what you've explicitly allowed. Got it. And it always asks permission before doing anything sensitive. It's not like I'm giving my AI like the master key to my computer. Right. Or like giving it access to specific drawers in my filing cabinet. Yeah, exactly. I'm starting to see how this could be both powerful and secure. Absolutely. So who's actually using MCP right now? Are there any real-world examples we can look at? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, one of the most well-known examples is the Claude desktop app. Okay. It has full support for MCP. Yeah. So that means you can like deeply integrate it with all sorts of local tools and data sources. You know, I've heard a lot of buzz about Claude desktop. Yeah. People saying it's a real game changer for personal AI assistance. But I mainly use like the web version of Claude. Right. Does that support MCP as well? So that's an important detail. Okay. Currently, only the desktop app, not the web app, supports MCP. So if you want to experience the full power of MCP with Claude, you'll need to download and install the desktop application. Good to know. Yeah. I'm adding that to my to-do list. Yeah, definitely. Right now. But is Claude the only one using MCP? It seems like this could be beneficial for all sorts of applications. You're absolutely right. I mean, there's a whole ecosystem of MCP clients emerging. There's Zed, which is a code editor that's designed with AI integration at its core. Oh, cool. Yeah. So it uses MCP to connect with external tools and data, turning your coding workflow into this like super powered AI assisted experience. Wait, so a code editor that can tap into my data? Totally. That sounds like it could open up some really interesting possibilities for developers. And then, you know, going even further, there's Sourcegraph Cody. Okay. It's not just a code editor. It's like having an AI coding partner. Wow. Cody uses MCP to analyze your entire code base, giving you intelligent suggestions, identifying potential bugs, and even helping you refactor your code in ways that you might not have even thought of. Wow. It sounds like MCP is already being used in some really innovative ways. But this is all still kind of abstract. Can we walk through like a concrete example? Yeah, let's do it. To see how this actually works in practice. So the MCP documentation has this great quick start guide that uses a simple SQLite database as an example. Okay. We've already prepped a database for this episode, so we can just jump right in. Okay, so we got our database ready to go. What's the next step? So the quick start guide walks you through configuring Claude Desktop to connect to this database through MCP. And you're basically telling Claude Desktop where to find the SQLite MCP server and how to access the specific database file. So it's like giving Claude a map to my database. Right. And the keys to unlock it. Exactly. Once it's connected, what can I actually do with it? Yeah, so the possibilities are, you know, pretty much endless. Okay. Let's say our database has information about products and their prices. Okay. You could ask Claude a simple question like, what products are available and their prices? Okay, that's a pretty basic query. What's happening behind the scenes when I ask Claude that? So that's where the magic of MCP comes in. Claude Desktop, through its SQLite client, sends a request to the SQLite MCP server. And then the server securely accesses the database, fetches the information, sends the results back to Claude, which then presents them to you in a nice, easy to understand format. It's amazing how all this like complex communication is happening without us even realizing it. Yeah, yeah. But let's push Claude a little further. What about something more analytical? Like what's the average price of all products? Oh, yeah. Now you're starting to tap into the real power of MCP. For a query like that, Claude would still interact with the SQLite server. But this time the server would need to, you know, crunch the numbers. Okay. It would calculate the average price based on your data and send that result back to Claude. So we're moving beyond just like simple data retrieval to actual data analysis. Exactly. This is starting to get really interesting. Right. But we're running out of time for this part of our deep dive. Don't worry, we'll pick up right where we left off in the next part. We'll explore even more powerful interactions with the SQLite database and then move on to some of the other exciting capabilities of MCP. Sounds good. I'm already hooked. We'll be right back after a short break. So before the break, we were really getting into how MCP could supercharge AI interactions with your data. And we were just starting to play around with a simple database. Right. Using the Claude desktop app. Yeah, it was really cool seeing how Claude could pull information from the database. Yeah. And even do some basic calculations. But I'm curious. Yeah. Can we do more than just ask like simple questions about prices? Can we get Claude to do some real insightful analysis? Absolutely. Let's say you want to understand how prices have changed over time. You could ask Claude something like, can you analyze the price distribution and suggest any pricing optimizations? Now that's a question that could actually help a business make better decisions. Right. But wouldn't that require Claude to like understand a lot about pricing strategies and market trends? Yeah. Yeah. And that's where the power of these large language models really comes in. So Claude can combine its vast knowledge of language and concepts with that specific data from your database. So it could analyze the price trends, compare them to industry benchmarks, maybe even suggest ways to adjust your pricing to maximize profit. Wow. It's like having an AI consultant working right alongside you. Yeah, totally. I'm starting to see how this could be a game changer. Yeah. For all sorts of tasks, not just business stuff. Exactly
