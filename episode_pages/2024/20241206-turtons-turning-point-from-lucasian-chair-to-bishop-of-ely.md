## Description

In Episode 10, we profile Thomas Turton, the ninth Lucasian professor, whose career arc runs from Cambridge math to high church leadership. We'll explore his open-education advocacy, his theological writings, and how his mathematical training may have influenced his views on education, religion, and society.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everybody. Can you believe it? Episode 10 already of our deep dive into the Lucasian professors of mathematics. 10 episodes. I know it. And we've had some incredible figures so far. We have. Newton, Airy, the list goes on. Some serious giants in math and physics, that's for sure. No doubt about it. But today, we're switching gears just a bit. Oh. How so? Well, today's subject, Thomas Turton. He held the Lucasian chair, but his story, it takes kind of an unexpected turn. Unexpected, huh? It's putting it mildly, I think. I mean, we're used to focusing on, well, you know, these huge figures in physics and pure mathematics, but Turton, yeah, brilliant guy, no question. But he made his biggest impact in a totally different area. Okay, now you've got me really intrigued. So we're talking about the ninth holder of the Lucasian chair, right? The one who came right after Airy. That's him, exactly. So fill us in. Where does Thomas Turton's story even begin? Let's go all the way back to February 25, 1780. Picture Hatfield, West Riding of Yorkshire. That's where Thomas Turton was born. And from there, he started his academic journey at Queen's College, Cambridge. But then he ended up at St. Catherine's College. St. Catherine's again. It feels like every single Lucasian professor we've talked about has some connection back to that college. It's true. They have an incredible track record there. And Turton, well, he really lived up to that St. Catherine's reputation. In 1805, he achieved something truly remarkable, graduating as senior wrangler and, get this, earning the Smith's Prize men in the same year. Hold on, wait a minute. Those are like the top honors you can get, right? That's got to be like, I don't know, being valedictorian and winning a national science fair all at once. That's exactly it. It almost never happens, especially in the same year. Seriously, it's incredibly rare, but it just goes to show you the kind of intellectual power Turton had and his dedication. He's obviously very committed to his studies. Wow, no wonder he got elected as a fellow of St. Catherine's just a year later. But here's where things get a little, well, a little interesting. Interesting how? Well, he held the Lucasian professorship of mathematics from 1822 to 1826. So that puts him right in that line of mathematicians that we've been exploring. But then... Then what? He became the Regis Professor of Divinity from 1827 to 1842. Quite a change, don't you think? From equations to scripture, that's one heck of a leap. You can say that again. What in the world could have prompted a shift like that? I mean, what made him go from math to religion? That's the million dollar question, isn't it? But his published works, those might give us a few clues because Turton, while he wasn't the kind of guy to stay confined to just mathematics, he was deeply involved in all the big theological and philosophical debates going on at the time. And he wrote a lot on some very, shall we say, controversial topics. So even while he was the Lucasian professor, his interests were clearly starting to broaden. Do we have any idea what kind of mathematical work he was actually doing during those years? Honestly, it's not something that's been documented very well. There's no record of any major discoveries or anything he published in mathematics during that time, as far as we know anyway. So a bit of a mystery then. Yeah, for now at least. But it seems like his time as the Lucasian professor was sort of a, well, a springboard into these other areas that he ended up focusing on. You know, that's an interesting way to look at it. It really makes you wonder if his way of thinking mathematically had any impact on his approach to theology and all the other things he was involved in. Yeah, it's a fascinating question. But before we get ahead of ourselves there, let's go back to his career, to the timeline. Okay, so where were we? Well, after the Lucasian chair and then that Regis professorship of divinity, his path leads him right into the heart of the Church of England, right? Absolutely. He became the dean of Peterborough in 1830, served until 1842, and then, well, he stepped into a role that's basically synonymous with British history, dean of Westminster Abbey. No way. Westminster Abbey, that place is just dripping with history. Talk about a journey from mathematical proofs to overseeing one of the most famous churches in the entire world. I know, right? Wait, there's more. The peak of his career, it came in 1845 when he was appointed Bishop of Ely. He held that position all the way until he died in 1864. Wow, Bishop of Ely. It's pretty hard to grasp, you know, that level of religious leadership. And to think it all started with this brilliant young mathematician at Cambridge. Yeah, it just shows you, right? Intellectual curiosity, it can take you to some pretty amazing places. It reminds us that even the most prestigious positions, even something like the Lucasian chair, well, it doesn't have to mean just one path. Sometimes it's like a launching pad into totally different areas of knowledge and influence. I'm really starting to see why you said Turton's story was unexpected. From the quiet world of academics to the grandeur of Westminster Abbey, and then leading an entire diocese, his life took some wild turns. It definitely did. And along the way, he left behind a whole body of work that gives us a fascinating glimpse into his mind. This guy who straddled the worlds of mathematics, theology, and even social change. All right, now I'm totally hooked. So what were these publications you mentioned earlier? Did they give any clues about how his mathematical thinking might have shaped his views on these other things, like theology? Well, there's one in particular that really stands out. It was published in 1834, and the title alone tells you he was wading into some deep waters. Thoughts on the Admission of Persons Without Regard to Their Religious Opinions to Certain Degrees in the Universities of England. Whoa, that title is a mouthful. It sounds like Turton was diving headfirst into some pretty controversial stuff. It does, doesn't it? Yeah, no kidding. I mean, think about it. This was 19th century England. Right. A time of huge social and religious upheaval. Absolutely. The whole idea of letting people with different beliefs into universities, especially these universities with such strong religious ties, that was, well, it was incredibly divisive. You're telling me. It's a debate that still hasn't really gone away, even all these centuries later. Should higher education be open to everyone, regardless of their faith? Or should these institutions stick to a specific set of beliefs, a religious dogma? It sounds like Turton was tackling these really tough questions head-on. Oh, absolutely. He was right in the thick of it. So what was his stance? Did he come down on one side or the other? I mean, did his writing say whether he was for or against admitting students with all these different religious views? He was all for it. Really? He argued that intellectual ability and academic merit, those should be the main things that matter, not whether you adhere to a particular religious doctrine. Wow. That was pretty progressive for the time, especially coming from someone who'd risen through the ranks of the Church of England. It was. It makes you wonder, right, did his mathematical background, did that play a role in his thinking? You know, that's a question that's fascinated scholars for years. Was there a link between the logic of math and his approach to these big social and theological questions? Did his training in deductive reasoning influence his views on inclusivity and academic freedom? It's almost like he was applying a mathematical lens, right, to these big societal problems. Like, instead of focusing on religious differences, he was emphasizing these shared intellectual pursuits, like a unifying force. Exactly. It makes you think about how these seemingly totally different fields of study can actually inform each other. It does. And for Turton, this wasn't just some theoretical thing. He was living this out in his own career, going from math to theology and then ending up in leadership roles in the church. It's almost as if he was proving his point through his own life, right? But hold on, let's circle back to his writing for a sec. You mentioned he was a prolific writer. Didn't he write about a bunch of other things besides university admissions? Oh, yeah. He wrote a ton. And as you might expect, given his position in the church, he dove deep into biblical studies. Especially how to interpret scripture. His work, The Text of the English Bible, that one really showcases his careful approach to, well, to understanding all the subtleties of translation and the historical context of the biblical texts. I can imagine. That kind of scholarship, it must have required such a crazy level of detail and precision. It's like, you know, those super meticulous proofs and theorems that mathematicians work through. Maybe that same dedication to accuracy and clarity, maybe that's what carried over into his theological work. It's definitely possible. And speaking of tackling tough theological questions, there's another work of his that's really worth noting. The Roman Catholic Doctrine of the Eucharist Considered. Okay, that one sounds like it could have stirred up some serious controversy. I mean, you've got the historical tension between the Church of England and the Catholic Church. What was Turton's take on the Eucharist? Well, I don't want to get too lost in the weeds of theology here,
