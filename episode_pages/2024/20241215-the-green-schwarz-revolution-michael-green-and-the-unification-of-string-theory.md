## Transcript

Welcome back. Today we're diving into the life and work of Michael Green, the 18th holder of that prestigious Lucasian chair. You might know him best for his work in string theory. Yes, specifically the first superstring revolution. Right, the first superstring revolution. To grasp how significant his work is though, we need to remember what string theory is all about. Exactly. At its core, string theory aims to bring all forces of nature together. Including gravity? Right. Gravity, which has always been a bit of an oddball in traditional quantum mechanics. That's where Michael Green's work comes in. It really does. His work tackled a problem that was really plaguing string theory. And it helped make string theory a stronger contender as a unified theory of everything. And that problem was? Anomalies. Anomalies. Yeah, for years string theory struggled with these things called anomalies. These inconsistencies that just pop up in calculations. And they threaten the entire foundation of a theory. So like trying to build a house with a blueprint full of errors. Yes. It just wouldn't stand. Okay, see, that's the kind of threat anomalies pose to string theory. So how did Michael Green solve this problem? What was his groundbreaking contribution? Well, Green, along with his collaborator John Schwartz, discovered what we now call the Green-Schwartz mechanism. Okay. A way to cancel out a specific type of anomaly in type I string theory. This type of string theory is interesting because it includes both open and closed strings. Adding another layer of complexity. Exactly. So essentially they found a way to fix the blueprint of string theory. Making it stronger. And more capable of describing the universe. Exactly. And the fix, it wasn't just some random patch. It required a very specific mathematical condition related to something called a symmetry group. Specifically, SO32. Now for anyone listening who's not a physicist. Yeah. Symmetry groups essentially describe the inherent patterns and structures within a theory. The Green-Schwartz mechanism showed that for this particular symmetry group, the anomalies just amazingly canceled out. Wow. That must have been huge for string theory. How did this change research in the field? Well, it sparked what's now known as the first superstring revolution. Before Green and Schwartz's work, you know, lots of people saw string theory as just this beautiful mathematical framework. Right. Too abstract to be a real description of the universe. But their discovery, it made the theory so much more credible mathematically sound. And it opened up so many new research avenues. Can you give us an idea of how the Green-Schwartz mechanism actually works? Sure. It basically involves adding what's known as a Chern-Simons term into the mathematical framework of string theory. Okay. This term just elegantly counteracts that troublesome anomaly. It restores balance to the equations. Yes, exactly. Think of it as adding a counterweight to stabilize a system. This is all during his time at Queen Mary College, right? Before the Lucasian professorship. You're right. He was a professor there from 1978 to 1993, before returning to Cambridge. But Green's work went beyond just the Green-Schwartz mechanism. Oh, right. His work on Dirichlet boundary conditions. Right. These boundary conditions basically define how strings can behave at the edges of space-time. So what are some of the implications of that? Well, it led to some crucial concepts, like D-brains. I've heard of D-brains. Yeah. But honestly, I need a reminder. What are D-brains? Why are they so important? Okay, so imagine open strings, like tiny pieces of thread, just floating in space-time. D-brains, which is short for Dirichlet branes, are surfaces where these open strings can attach themselves. They're like multidimensional membranes within space-time. So it's not just strings vibrating in empty space. They're interacting with these D-brains. Yes, exactly. And that interaction adds a whole new level of complexity and possibilities within string theory. These D-brains, they can have different dimensions, from point-like particles to higher-dimensional structures, which really enriches the landscape of possible universes that string theory can describe. Wow. So not only did he help solidify string theory's foundation, but he opened up pathways to explore these new concepts. It's really quite a legacy. It is. Now I understand why he ended up in such a prestigious position. Absolutely. He was confirmed as the Lucasian professor in 2009, following Stephen Hawking, and he held the chair until 2015. Quite a lineage. It really is. Speaks volumes about his contributions to physics. Before we get into his time as the Lucasian professor, let's rewind a bit. Where did this all begin? Well, his story starts in London, where he was born in 1946. Post-war London. A time of rebuilding. Where did his academic journey begin? He attended William Ellis School in London, and then it was up to Cambridge. Cambridge. So much scientific history there. You can practically feel the weight of history in those halls, and Green thrived there. Graduated from Churchill College, Cambridge, first class honors in theoretical physics in 1967. First class honors. Exceptional. Absolutely. And he continued his studies at Cambridge, earning his PhD in elementary particle theory in 1970. So even in his doctoral work, he was already focused on the fundamental building blocks of the universe. It seems that way. After his PhD, he went on to a series of postdoctoral research positions. First at Princeton University, then back at Cambridge, and then the University of Oxford. Princeton, Cambridge, Oxford. What an amazing opportunity to be part of those communities. Must have been an incredibly stimulating time for him. During those years, he really refined his skills, delving deeper into quantum field theory, laying the groundwork for his later breakthroughs in string theory. So we have Michael Green, PhD from Cambridge, postdoctoral experience from some of the top universities in the world. What happened next? In 1978, he joined the faculty at Queen Mary College, University of London. That's where I left off. That's where he spent the next 15 years working his way up to professor, right? Yes, that's right. And it was at Queen Mary College that his collaboration with John Schwartz really took off, leading to that big breakthrough we were talking about earlier. Right, the Green-Schwartz mechanism. Do we know anything about their collaboration? What was it like in those early days? Well, they were known to spend countless hours just discussing, working through complex equations, challenging each other's ideas. It was a true partnership, driven by their shared passion for uncovering the secrets of the universe. Their dedication and collaboration led to a major turning point in theoretical physics. It wasn't just about one discovery. It was about a whole new way of thinking about the universe. You're absolutely right. It paved the way for further exploration into new types of string theory, the concept of D-brains, and just a deeper understanding of reality itself. It's remarkable how one collaboration can have such a huge impact. It really is a testament to scientific inquiry, collaboration, and that relentless pursuit of knowledge. Now, after all that he did at Queen Mary College, did he ever go back to Cambridge? He did. In 1993, he was appointed John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Theoretical Physics at Cambridge. It seems fitting that he would return to where his academic journey began. And it was back at Cambridge that he continued to make really significant contributions to string theory, cementing his place as a leader in the field. And then, in 2009, he was appointed to the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, succeeding Stephen Hawking. It's a position that has been held by some of the most brilliant minds in history, which really shows the impact and influence of Michael Green's work. To follow in the footsteps of giants like Stephen Hawking and Isaac Newton is incredible. It's a testament to a lifetime dedicated to pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge. What a journey. From those early days as a student at Cambridge to holding the Lucasian Chair. His story is really inspirational. Profound discoveries often start with a spark of curiosity, challenging conventional wisdom, and the perseverance to explore the unknown. And his journey didn't end there. After serving as the Lucasian Professor, he continued his research and shared his knowledge, mentoring new generations of physicists. His impact is far beyond just his own discoveries. Absolutely. He's played a huge role in nurturing the future of physics, ensuring that the search for knowledge, the pursuit of a unified theory, continues. Now, reflecting on his life and career, I'm curious about the impact of that first superstring revolution, the period of intense activity and excitement sparked by his work with John Schwartz. How did the Green-Schwartz mechanism influence how string theory developed in the years that followed? It's a great question. It gets to the heart of how science progresses. The Green-Schwartz mechanism wasn't just about solving a problem, you know. It opened up all sorts of new possibilities. It was like a catalyst that pushed the field forward in unpredictable ways. So it was a turning point. It redefined how string theory research was done. Exactly. New ideas explored, new connections made, and suddenly that dream of unifying all forces of nature felt closer than ever before. Must have been electric for the physics community. Did the Green-Schwartz mechanism lead to other breakthroughs? Did it open up entirely new lines of inquiry? Absolutely. For example, it led to the development of new types of string theory, including type 2 string theory, which Green co-discovered with John Schwartz. It wasn't just one isolated discovery. It was a foundation for a whole new framework of theories and concepts. It's amazing how far string theory has come, and it's clear that Michael Green's work was instrumental. It was crucial. He was a true pioneer in the field
