## Transcript

Welcome back, everybody, for another deep dive. This time we're going on a deep dive into the world of Srinivasa Ramanujan, a brilliant mathematician. You may not know the name, but you're going to know it by the time we're done here today because we're going to be talking about some of the stuff that he left behind, these things called mock theta functions. Yeah, they're very intriguing. They're very intriguing. And we've got a couple of sources here to help us break this down. We've got an entry from the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS, which is going to be dealing with some curious coefficients that we're going to be looking at. And then also we've got some background on mock theta functions themselves. Right. Those are great starting points. Absolutely. To really dive into this. And the OEIS sequence, it's A000039. It starts with 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 5. Hmm. Interesting. Negative signs. Those are fascinating, right? A little curious. Yeah. What's going on there? What are these negative signs telling us about these mock theta functions? Yeah, so they give us a hint as to the complexity of these functions because when you represent a specific mock theta function as a series, these coefficients are related to that. So it tells you how each term contributes to the function's behavior. Okay, so it's like each coefficient is kind of like a clue. Exactly. To the bigger picture of what the mock theta function is. Exactly. Think of it like a recipe. Okay. Where each ingredient has a certain amount and those amounts determine what the final taste will be. I see. I see. Yeah. Interesting. So those coefficients are like the amounts of each ingredient and that sort of shapes the overall form of the mock theta function. Okay. And the OEIS even provides a formula to approximate how these coefficients are going to behave further down the line in the sequence. Yeah, it's a fascinating formula. It's incredible. It involves pi and square roots. It basically tells you these coefficients grow very rapidly as you go further down the sequence and that growth rate is somehow tied to pi and the square root of the position in the sequence. Wow. Yeah. Unexpected ingredients in a recipe. Yeah. So we've got this mysterious sequence here but it gives us a little bit of a taste of the world of mock theta functions which as we mentioned were first introduced by Ramanujan in his last letter to the mathematician G.H. Hardy. Yeah. But in that letter he didn't actually formally define them. Right. He just gave like 17 examples of these functions. Wow. He's just like... And it was left to later mathematicians to figure out what was going on. Here you go, figure this out. Exactly. It was like a puzzle. He just dropped that in a letter. Like hey, by the way, check this out. I bet Hardy was a little overwhelmed. Oh yeah, for sure. Just like maybe our listeners right now are feeling like, okay, this is something completely new. Alright, break this down for me. Yeah. And it took actually decades of research to really understand what these functions were about and it involved contributions from many different mathematicians. But one mathematician who I think was really key was Sanders Wiggers. Okay. He actually connected these mock theta functions to this broader concept called harmonic mass forms. Okay. And that really gave us the framework to understand what was going on. Okay. So we know that they're important but what exactly are they? Yeah, so imagine them as like mathematical chameleons. Okay. Yeah, they're typically represented as these things called q-series which are basically infinite sums involving a variable q which is a complex number with magnitude less than one. So like a simple example would be like 1 plus q plus q squared plus q cubed and so on. Okay, so that's like the base. That's like the base and then you can modify it by changing the exponents and the coefficients and things like that. Exactly, exactly. So it's all about how you raise q to different powers and how you combine them with coefficients and some of these combinations lead to these fascinating mock theta functions that have this kind of like almost but not quite theta function behavior. Oh, so that's where the mock comes in. That's exactly where the mock comes in. It's like a mockingbird sort of mimicking the theta function. Yeah, and near certain points in the complex plane they actually do behave like regular theta functions. Yeah. But if you look at their behavior globally they don't quite fit the mold of being something called a modular form. So hold on, modular form. Modular form. What's that? Yeah, modular forms are kind of like this special class of functions that have these really remarkable symmetries. Okay. And they remain essentially unchanged under certain transformations and they're really, really important in number theory and other fields of mathematics. They sound very elegant. They are. Like very refined. Very elegant. So they're not quite that. So the mock theta functions, they kind of have some of that elegance but they don't obey the rules strictly of modular forms. Okay, interesting. But they have another very intriguing characteristic. Okay. Which is that they have these things called singularities. Singularities. Remind me, what are those again? Oh gosh, it's been so long. It's been a while. Yeah. So you remember how we said that the variable q in these series is a complex number with magnitude less than one. Yes. So as q approaches certain points, and these points are called roots of unity. Okay. Some mock theta functions become unbounded. Unbounded. Oh gosh. Yeah. Okay, so roots of unity, danger zones. Yeah, you could say that. Okay. So in certain regions, the function behaves very nicely. Okay. But as q gets close to these roots of unity, the function kind of blows up. It becomes really, really large. Okay. It goes to infinity. I'm trying to visualize this in my head. So we got q moving around within a circle on the complex plane. Exactly. And it's getting close to certain points on that circle, and things start to get a little wild. Exactly, exactly. It adds like another layer of complexity and intrigue to their behavior. So they're playing by their own rules. They are. And it took the work of mathematicians like Zwegers to kind of figure them out. Yeah. So what Zwegers did is he connected mock theta functions to this broader concept called harmonic mass forms. Exactly. And how did that help? Imagine you're trying to assemble a puzzle, but you don't have the full picture. Okay. So that's kind of what it was like with mock theta functions before Zwegers came along. Yeah. What he did is he provided the missing framework. Ah, okay. He said, oh, these mock theta functions, they're actually part of this bigger picture. I see. They're part of this world of harmonic mass forms. Okay. And this really allowed us to understand how these pieces fit together. So it's like Ramanujan saw the pieces, but didn't necessarily put them together. Exactly. He had these glimpses of these objects. Yeah. But it took someone like Zwegers to come along and say, oh, this is how they all fit together. I see. Yeah. That's amazing how seemingly incomplete ideas. Yeah. Can spark decades of research. Exactly. It really highlights the collaborative nature of math and the power of human curiosity. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, it really speaks to the lasting impact of Ramanujan's work, you know, even after a century. Yeah. His work is still driving mathematical research today. It's pretty remarkable. But let's shift gears for a second here and let's go a little bit deeper into the application of these mock theta functions. Okay. You had mentioned earlier a connection to physics. Yeah. I'm very curious about that. How do these abstract concepts that we're talking about find a place in the real world? Yeah. So it might come as a surprise, but these seemingly esoteric mathematical objects, they have found applications in areas like string theory and the study of black holes. That's incredible. String theory, black holes, those are like some of the most... Those are some of the most mind-boggling ideas in physics. Yeah. How do mock theta functions even come close? Yeah. So both string theory and the study of black holes involve incredibly complex mathematics. Okay. They require tools that can handle very, very intricate relationships and symmetries. Right. And it turns out that mock theta functions with their unique properties and their connection to these modular forms provide some of those necessary tools. Oh, wow. Yeah. So it's like a mathematical tool that physicists can then use to model and understand these complex phenomena. Exactly. They provide a way to describe and analyze the underlying mathematical structure of these physical theories. That's so cool. It's like a really great example of how abstract math can have real-world implications. It really makes you wonder what other hidden connections are out there just waiting to be discovered. Absolutely. It's a reminder that math is a fundamental language of the universe and its applications can extend far beyond what we initially imagine. Absolutely. So speaking of expanding our imagination, let's revisit these Q series for a second. We talked about how they're sort of like the building blocks for the mock theta functions. Right. But I'm still not entirely clear on what they look like. Can you give me a visual here? Sure. So imagine you have an infinite sum where each term involves this variable Q raised to a certain power. And those powers might follow a certain pattern. And there might be these coefficients, these numbers that multiply each term. Okay, so far so good. Okay, so a specific example would be the following. One plus Q plus 2Q squared plus 3Q cubed plus 5Q to the fourth and so on. Okay, so here the coefficients of each term is a Fibonacci number.
