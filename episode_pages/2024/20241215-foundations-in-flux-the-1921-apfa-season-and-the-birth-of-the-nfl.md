## Transcript

All right, buckle up everybody for a deep dive into the 1921 APFA season. Oh yeah, this one's a wild ride. Seriously, you sent over the Wikipedia entry and some notes you made? I was fascinated by this season. Yeah, and it's clear why. I mean, this is the year the league really started taking shape. Yeah, it's crazy to think 1920 they're just forming, and 1921, boom, they're already restructuring, setting up territorial rights, membership criteria. Like someone just flipped a switch and said, okay, time to get serious. Right, it's not just a bunch of teams playing anymore. Definitely not. Your notes mention this reorganization meeting in Akron. Ah, yes, Akron. That's where they brought in Joe Carr. The baseball guy. Exactly. Already a big name in baseball. They needed someone with experience to really lay down the law, you know? To give the league structure. Yeah, draft a constitution, bylaws, all that. Think about it. Every pro sports league goes through this. Those early years, right? It's got to be chaotic. Total chaos. But you got to build a solid foundation too. I'm picturing this Akron meeting, like smoke-filled rooms, guys arguing over every rule. Oh, absolutely. No Twitter to announce the changes either. Can you imagine? Like, how'd they even spread the news back then? Word of mouth, telegrams, who knows? But the passion was there, that's for sure. And speaking of chaos, that Wikipedia list of teams. 21 teams in 1921. It's mind-boggling, some of those names too. Evansville, Crimson Giants, the Minneapolis Marines, Tonawanda Cardinals. Tonawanda Cardinals, what a name, right? It's incredible how many teams just popped up and then disappeared. It's the Wild West of football, right? New concept, competing with baseball for fans. And travel back then, yikes. Plus, your notes mentioned the salary cap. Oh, don't get me started. $1,800 per game for the entire team. It's peanuts? You can't even buy a decent used car for that today, let alone pay a whole team. No wonder so many teams folded, merged, just gone. Like the Detroit Tigers. Yeah. Absorbed by the Buffalo All-Americans midseason. Poof. Imagine starting a business today with those stakes. Would you last a whole season? Tough call. But that love of the game, it must have been something else. Pure grit. Definitely pioneers. We're just skimming the surface here, folks, but it's already wild. It gets even wilder. And then there are the personalities. Oh, yeah, your cast of characters list is amazing. Jim Thorpe coaching the Cleveland Indians, Curly Lambeau starting out with Green Bay. Legends. And we can't forget Fritz Pollard. One of the first African-American head coaches in pro football. Talk about breaking barriers. It's incredible, especially considering the times. Absolutely. But hold on. We got to talk about Curly Lambeau and the Packers getting suspended. Wait, what? In their first season? Yeah, the Taylorville incident. What happened? Spilled the beans on a play. Fought the refs. They used ineligible players. College guys from Notre Dame under fake names. Really? Like ringers from another league? No, college players. Back then, the rules were blurry. So college guys playing pro, that's crazy. The APFA was trying to draw a line, though. Separate the pros from the amateurs. And the Packers crossed it. Big time. The league suspended them for the rest of the season. Major setback for Green Bay. But shows how the league was figuring itself out. Trying to be legit, you know? Exactly. This whole season, it's a microcosm of the NFL's early history. Finances, personalities, controversies. And speaking of controversy... The Staley Swindle. A championship decided by, well, you could call it a technicality. This one's wild. Buffalo beats Chicago on Thanksgiving, 7-6. Tommy Hewitt leads the All-Americans to victory. But Chicago, they wanted a rematch. And Buffalo agreed. They did. But as an exhibition. Didn't want to risk their record, you see. Smart move. Well, Chicago wins the rematch, 10-7. But here's the kicker. They counted the rematch in the standings. Yep. So both teams end up 9-1. But Buffalo had fewer losses overall, right? So they should be the champs. You'd think. But new tiebreaker rule. If two teams played multiple times, the last game mattered more. So because Chicago won the rematch? They were crowned champions. Buffalo fans were furious. Hence, the Staley Swindle. It's crazy how different the rules were back then. Talk about a game changer, literally. But hey, that's 1921 for you. Unpredictable, right? It sure is. And we've just scratched the surface. Oh yeah, there's so much more to uncover. But that's a story for another time. We gotta talk more about Fritz Pollard. This guy's story is incredible. It really is. I mean, African-American head coach in 1921, that's huge. Right. Breaking barriers left and right. A testament to his talent and his determination. Imagine the challenges he faced. I know, right? And people forget, Pollard wasn't just a coach. He was a star player too. Helped the Akron Pros win the championship in 1920. Wow, so he knew the game inside and out. Makes his coaching success even more impressive. Absolutely. And it just makes you think, how many other talented players and coaches were overlooked back then? It's a tough question to think about, but an important one. Pollard's story isn't just about overcoming adversity. It's about excellence too. You got it. He was known for his offensive strategies. Really innovative for the time. The true visionary. And not just for his football skills, but for what he represented, you know? Challenging those racial prejudices head on. Yeah. And don't forget, he wasn't the only one. Inc. Williams coached the Hammond Pros that same year. So two African-American head coaches in 1921. Wow, that's really significant. It is. They weren't just coaching. They were paving the way for future generations. And it makes you wonder how their presence might have shaped the league. Not just on the field, but off it too. Right. It's a reminder that the history of the NFL, it's not just about the games. It's about the people. Their stories, their struggles, their triumphs. Speaking of stories, remember those other teams with the interesting names? The Crimson Giants? The Marines? Yeah. All those teams that popped up and then vanished? Oh yeah, those guys. They might not have lasted long, but they were a big part of the league's growth, you know? In what way? Well, think about it. The APFA was so decentralized back then. Teams were popping up in smaller towns, driven by local fans. It's almost like they were these little community hubs bringing people together. Exactly. And while a lot of them folded, they helped spread the popularity of the game. Planted the seeds for what the NFL would become. And it's kind of sad how many of those stories are lost. The Tonawanda Cardinals, one game, and they were gone. Poof, vanished. It makes you wonder, what were their stories? What were those games like? We may never know, but their contributions are still there, woven into the fabric of the NFL's history. It's like a hidden world, you know? Full of stories we'll never get to hear. Lost to time. But it's fascinating to imagine what those stories might tell us. It makes you realize that what we know about history is just a small piece of the puzzle. Right. And sometimes, the missing pieces are the most intriguing. Definitely. But even with those gaps, we can still see how important the 1921 season was. A real turning point for the league. Absolutely. The APFA was starting to become more organized, more structured. Moving away from that informal, chaotic beginning. Right. And we can see that evolution in everything we've been talking about. The rule changes, the territorial rights, the emergence of these iconic figures like Thorpe and Pollard. And even those controversies like the Staley Swindle. It's like watching something take shape, you know? Each step brings it closer to what it's going to become. And 1921 was a big step. It shows how even the smallest things can have a huge impact down the line. The butterfly effect in action. Exactly. What if Buffalo had refused that rematch? Would they be remembered as the champs today? Or what if Green Bay had folded after that suspension? Would we even know who Curly Lambeau is? Mind-blowing to think about. Right. A few small changes and the whole landscape of the NFL could be completely different. And it shows why it's important to understand the why of history, not just the what. To see how everything is connected. So let's bring this back to the listener for a second. Why should we care about the 1921 APFA season today? Because it reminds us where the NFL came from. You know, before the billion-dollar stadiums and the Super Bowl halftime shows. It's easy to forget that, right? To get caught up in the glitz and glamour of the modern game. But those early years, they were all about the love of the game. The grit, the determination. They laid the foundation for everything that came after. It's like a family heirloom, you know? Maybe it's not flashy, but it has a story, a connection to the past. And that connection, it helps us understand the present. By looking back at those
