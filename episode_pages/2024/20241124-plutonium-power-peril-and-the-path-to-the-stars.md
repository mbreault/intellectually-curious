## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive. Today we're diving into the world of plutonium. You gave us some really interesting starting points, a Wikipedia entry and a short piece on the history of plutonium. And we're here to sort of break down the essential facts about it and unearth some surprising insights along the way. Yeah, it's a fascinating element, that's for sure. It's not something you encounter every day, but its impact on history and science is undeniable. Yeah, plutonium, it almost sounds like something out of science fiction. But before we get lost in the cosmos, let's rewind the clock to its discovery. Both of our sources pinpoint 1940 with Glenn Seaborg and Edwin McMillan at the University of California, Berkeley. And it wasn't your typical lab experiment. They were using a cyclotron, which is this particle accelerator, to bombard uranium with deuterons, which are, for those keeping track at home, the nuclei of heavy hydrogen. So they were essentially smashing atoms together. Talk about heavy duty science. And it's interesting that creating plutonium was a two-step process. It was. You're right. The bombardment produced neptunium first, another radioactive element. And neptunium decays. It's a radioactive element, so it decays pretty quickly. And guess what it decays into? Plutonium. Plutonium, exactly. It's like a radioactive family tree. That's a good way to put it. With plutonium emerging from the decay of its parent element. And all of this was happening under a veil of wartime secrecy. Absolutely. World War II was in full swing and the potential of plutonium, especially for weapons, was immediately recognized. Wow. It's really fascinating how science and global events just intertwine like that. Speaking of fascinating, the name itself, plutonium. It seems like following uranium, named for Uranus, and neptunium for Neptune, it seems like a natural progression to name this new element after the next celestial body in line, Pluto. Exactly. At the time, Pluto was still considered a planet, so it fit perfectly into that naming scheme. And honestly, it's kind of fitting, given the almost mythical power and mystery that's associated with plutonium. Okay, let's unpack that power a bit. We know plutonium is radioactive, but how does that translate into its use in nuclear fission? So some isotopes of plutonium, particularly plutonium-239, are fissile. Meaning they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction. And it's this chain reaction that's really at the heart of both nuclear reactors and, unfortunately, nuclear weapons. So help me visualize this. What exactly happens during nuclear fission? Okay, so imagine a plutonium-239 nucleus getting hit by a neutron. That impact causes the nucleus to split into smaller pieces, releasing a massive burst of energy. And here's the key, more neutrons. Ah, so those newly released neutrons go on to hit other plutonium nuclei, causing them to split and release even more energy, even more neutrons. It's like a domino effect on an atomic scale. Precisely. That's the chain reaction. And the energy released during these splits is what makes plutonium so incredibly powerful. It's starting to become clear why the Manhattan Project, that top-secret World War II effort, was so focused on plutonium. Yeah, the potential of plutonium to create just incredibly powerful bombs was recognized very, very quickly. And the Manhattan Project was all about figuring out how to produce it on a large scale. Right. They needed enough to build atomic bombs, and they did it. They built those massive production reactors. Our sources mention the X-10 graphite reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and those at Hanford, Washington. It's hard to grasp the scale and complexity of what they achieved. It was remarkable. A remarkable feat of engineering and scientific collaboration, all driven by that wartime urgency. They essentially built giant factories to churn out plutonium. Right. A process that was incredibly complex and dangerous. And ultimately, their work led to the creation of Fat Man, the plutonium-fueled atomic bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki. Yeah, a sobering reminder of the immense destructive power that plutonium holds. And the legacy of the Manhattan Project and the subsequent Cold War has left us with a lot of plutonium to deal with, a challenge that we still continue to deal with today. Right. Our sources talk about these massive stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium. So what happens to it all once it's no longer needed for weapons? That's the million-dollar question. Disposing of plutonium safely and securely is a huge concern for both environmental and security reasons. It's incredibly long-lived, and even small amounts can be incredibly dangerous if mishandled. It's a legacy that we're still grappling with. So plutonium has this dark side, this immense destructive potential, but it's also used for peaceful purposes, right? Like in nuclear reactors. Exactly. Plutonium isn't just about bombs. It can be used as fuel in nuclear reactors to generate electricity. Right. And there's also something called mixed oxide fuel, or MOX fuel, where plutonium is mixed with uranium. MOX fuel, isn't that like recycling nuclear fuel, getting more energy out of it? That's a great way to put it. It's essentially giving spent nuclear fuel, the byproduct of traditional reactors, a second life. Right. And it has some advantages, increased efficiency and a reduction in the amount of nuclear waste we have to deal with. So plutonium is a bit like a double-edged sword, capable of great destruction, but also holding the potential for clean energy. Exactly. What a complex character. It really is. But it's not all doom and gloom, right? No, not at all. There are actually some incredible applications of plutonium, especially in space exploration. Wait, space exploration? This is where things get really interesting. You got it. Specifically, plutonium-238 is used in something called a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG for short. Break that down for me. It's essentially a compact, incredibly reliable power source. It can run for decades without needing refueling or maintenance. Perfect for those deep space missions where solar panels just aren't practical. I see. And our sources mentioned some pretty famous examples. The Voyager probes, Cassini, Galileo, New Horizons, even the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers on Mars are powered by these plutonium-powered RTGs. Exactly. These groundbreaking missions wouldn't have been possible without that reliable power provided by plutonium-238. It's amazing to think that this element, which can be so destructive, is also helping us unlock the secrets of the cosmos. It's incredible how plutonium has played such a pivotal role, from the depths of war to the frontiers of space exploration. But let's get back down to Earth for a moment. We've talked about its power, but what about its safety? Right. I mean, plutonium is radioactive, so how do you even handle this stuff? That's a crucial point. Plutonium is highly toxic. We're talking radioactive and a heavy metal, so it can poison you in two very different ways. Its radioactivity can damage cells and DNA, leading to things like radiation sickness, cancer, even death. And then you have that heavy metal toxicity, which also poses very serious health risks. That sounds pretty scary. Our sources mention that careful handling, storage, and transport are absolutely essential. There are strict regulations in place to minimize the risks, right? Absolutely. There's no room for error when dealing with plutonium. Accidental exposure, whether it's through ingestion, inhalation, or even skin contact, can have devastating consequences. And it's particularly worrisome because of its tendency to accumulate in the bone marrow. Wow. That's a lot to take in about plutonium. It is. From its discovery to its diverse applications, from its power to its potential for harm, it truly is a remarkable element. But there's still more to uncover, right? Definitely. There's a whole other layer of complexity when you start talking about plutonium's physical properties, its various forms, and its sometimes unpredictable behavior. Okay. And we haven't even touched on how it's transported. Sounds like we have plenty more ground to cover in our deep dive into the world of plutonium. Let's dive into the heart of what makes plutonium so unique, its physical characteristics. You might be surprised to learn just how peculiar this element is. All right. I'm ready for some plutonium peculiarities. We know it's a metal, but what makes it so unusual? Well, for starters, plutonium has not one, not two, but six different allotropes at ambient pressure. Hold on, allotropes. Could you remind me what those are again? Of course. Think of allotropes as different forms of the same element, each with its own unique crystal structure and density. Right. It's kind of like how carbon can be a super hard diamond or a soft flaky pencil lead. Right. Same element, wildly different properties. Ah, that makes sense. So plutonium can morph into these different forms, each with its own quirks. Exactly. And these allotropes make plutonium incredibly sensitive to changes in temperature or pressure or even its chemical environment. Wow. It can actually change its volume dramatically as it shifts between these forms. That's incredible. It's almost as if plutonium has a mind of its own, changing its personality depending on the environment. Right. No wonder it's so challenging to work with. You hit the nail on the head. This shape-shifting nature makes machining plutonium incredibly difficult. Yeah. It can change states so easily, making it unpredictable and difficult to handle. I can only imagine the headaches that must have given the scientists working on the Manhattan Project. I'm sure there were a few. But let's delve into the specifics of these allotropes. At room temperature, plutonium exists in its alpha form. Okay. It's brittle and hard, much like cast iron.
