## Description

In this episode, we pull back the curtain on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe to show a life that fused science, art, and philosophy. We trace his leap from law to poetry, his hands-on work in botany, color theory, and geology, and his idea that inner experience and empirical observation can illuminate the same questions. With a through-line from biography to enduring concepts like metamorphosis, color perception, and innerlichkeit, we explore why Goetheâ€™s interdisciplinary mindset still matters for todayâ€™s STEM-minded problem-solvers.

## Transcript

Hey everyone, welcome back for another deep dive. Today we're tackling Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Goethe? Yes. You know, the Faust guy. Right, right. But there's so much more to him than just that one work. We're using a biography and his Wikipedia page as our guide today. Ah, nice combo. Yeah. It's going to give us like a really well-rounded look, I think. So get ready to uncover some surprising stuff about Goethe. I think especially if you're coming from like a STEM background. Exactly. Okay, so to kick things off, let's map out some of the major milestones in Goethe's life just to get a sense of, you know... The timeline. The timeline, yeah. I think you'll find some interesting parallels to paths that a lot of STEM folks take. Definitely. If you look at his early fascination with natural phenomena. Oh yeah. I mean, the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, it really affected him. Wow. You know, it challenged his faith and it might have even steered him towards a more empirical... Scientific. A more scientific perspective. It's almost like he was thinking like, okay, if the world can be this unpredictable, there's got to be some deeper explanation here. Absolutely. Like beyond what we currently understand. Right. And it's interesting to think that, you know, Goethe initially went for law. Law? Yeah. A field that a lot of people drawn to, like structure and logic choose, you know? Yeah. Much like many STEM fields. Like think about a future literary icon just like pouring over legal texts. It's wild. It is kind of funny to picture. Totally. Okay, but then obviously he shifts gears. Yeah, he transitions to the arts, humanities. With help from mentors like Herder. But what brought on this change? Was it like a complete rejection of logic? I don't think so. Okay. I think it was more expanding his intellectual horizons. Okay. You know, he wasn't rejecting logic, but he was looking for a deeper meaning. Just through different means, you know? Okay, yeah. And remember, this was the Romantic era. Right. A movement that emphasized, you know, emotion, intuition, and subjective experience. Oh, interesting. As pathways to understanding the world. So not logic out, but like feeling in. Yeah, exactly. I mean, this makes me think about that whole debate between objective observation and subjective interpretation, which is still so relevant even in science today. Absolutely, it is. And even while he was doing all this artsy stuff, Goethe's scientific curiosity, it never went away. Oh, that's cool. Like, for example, his Italian journey. It wasn't just a cultural trip. Oh, really? No. He was super into geology. Oh, wow. Like collecting tons of rock samples. Like a true Renaissance man. Totally. He saw connections between all these seemingly totally different fields. Something I think a lot of people in STEM can relate to, right? Sure. I mean, innovation often happens at the intersection of disciplines. Right, right. It really is like a key part of his genius. He didn't see like these strict boundaries between different fields. Interesting. He thought you could get a deeper understanding of things by bringing together insights from, you know, all these different areas. That makes sense. And to show you what I mean. Okay. Let's look at some of Goethe's like actual scientific work. Okay, yeah, let's hear it. What did he contribute? Stuff that's still relevant. Wow. Even today, centuries later. Yeah. Okay, so let's start with his book Metamorphosis of Plants. Okay. From 1790. Okay. He was really careful in how he looked at plants. Cool. You know, like how they grow and change. And he thought that all the different parts of a plant like leaves, stems, flowers. Right. They're all just variations of like one basic form. Oh, that's fascinating. Right. Yeah. So like there's this underlying blueprint for how they develop. Exactly. And, you know, it wasn't exactly like evolutionary theory as we know it today. Right. But his ideas about transformation and how all life forms are connected, they kind of foreshadowed some really important concepts. Like evolution. Yeah, exactly. Oh, wow. So even though this was way before Darwin. Yeah, he was already kind of hinting at those ideas. Like common descent and how life forms gradually change over time. Exactly. Wow. And his sharp observation skills, they weren't just for plants, you know? Oh, really? What else? Remember those color theory classes you might have taken? Oh, yeah. Vaguely. Lots of mixing paints. Yeah, yeah. Trying to figure out all those like color relationships. Right. Well, Goethe had some strong opinions about color. Oh, really? Yeah. Okay. He published his theory of colors in 1810, which was a direct challenge to Newton's ideas. Whoa, going right at Newton. Okay, what was his argument? So Goethe, he focused on the subjective experience of color. Okay. He was saying that color, it's not just about light, like Newton said, but it's also about how our eyes and brains like see it. Oh, so like our perception plays a part in how we experience color. Exactly. It's not just like an objective thing. And this theory, it was controversial, but people still debate it today and, you know, art, philosophy, and even science. Wow. So the whole objective versus subjective thing, it's still a hot topic. Yeah. It's really interesting to think about. Totally. I mean, it makes you wonder about like the nature of perception itself. Right. Like how much of what we think we see is actually shaped by our senses and like our brains. Exactly. Wow. And those are the kind of questions that Goethe's work makes us think about. I like that. But, you know, his science stuff wasn't just about plants and color. Yeah. He had this massive collection of minerals. Oh. Over 17,000 samples. That's insane. Okay. But what did he do with them? What did he learn? It wasn't just a hobby, you know? It helped him understand geology and the Earth's history. And it shows you that he really believed in like getting hands on to learn about science. Oh, yeah. That's cool. So a true scientist at heart. Yeah. But he made other discoveries too. Oh, okay. What else? Well, in anatomy, he discovered the intermaxillary bone. Oh, wow. Sometimes called Goethe's bone. Okay. He proved that humans have it, which some scientists back then didn't believe. Amazing. So he was always exploring and questioning things. Yeah. He had this like insatiable curiosity. Yeah. But it's important to remember that his scientific work wasn't separate from his other interests. Right. He saw connections between, you know, science, art, literature, philosophy. Yeah. He believed that all of them could help us understand the world better. That integrated approach, I think that's really important today. Yeah. When we're facing all these like complex problems that need people from different fields to work together. Absolutely. So how do all these contributions, how do they make a lasting impact? Yeah, that's a good question. Well, Goethe's influence goes way beyond the specific things he found out. Right. His work has shaped so many areas from literature and music to philosophy and even modern science. For example, his concept of innerlichkeit. Innerlichkeit. Which is kind of like inwardness in English. It had a huge impact on how we understand human psychology and how we explore subjective experience and art. That's interesting. I'd like to know more about that. Yeah, sure. What exactly is innerlichkeit and why is it so important? So innerlichkeit is about like going deep into human consciousness. Okay. You know, exploring the inner world of emotions, thoughts, and motivations. So like getting to the core of what makes us human. Exactly. Trying to grasp the complexities of our inner lives. Yes. And this focus on the individual's inner world, it had a big influence on the Romantic movement. And it still informs how we explore psychology and consciousness today. Wow. So his impact goes way beyond just science. Yeah. It shapes how we see ourselves and our place in the world. Absolutely. And that's just one example of how Goethe's ideas are still relevant. Yeah. That's amazing. You know, it's really striking how Goethe's like multifaceted approach to knowledge seems so relevant now. Especially in our modern world where like thinking across disciplines is becoming so important. Yeah, I agree. It's not just the knowledge itself. It's the approach, the mindset that Goethe embodies, you know? Yeah. That's what continues to inspire us. Right. His legacy, it challenges us to embrace curiosity, to connect ideas that seem like totally different, and to see the world from lots of different perspectives. I like that. Yeah, it really is amazing how much his influence is still felt, you know, even centuries later. It is. It's pretty incredible. His ability to like, you know, bring together knowledge from different places and to find those connections. Yeah. I think that's something we can all, you know, try to do in our own lives. Totally. But it's not just about like having all this knowledge, right? Goethe himself said, and I'm going to quote him here, knowing is not enough. We must apply. Willing is not enough. We must do. That's so true. Yeah, he was all about action, taking what you learn, and actually making a difference. Making it real, yeah. So like, how can we, you know, especially in those STEM fields, how can we use Goethe's ideas in our own work, in our lives? Because, you know, we're all about solving problems, pushing boundaries, innovating. Absolutely. So think
