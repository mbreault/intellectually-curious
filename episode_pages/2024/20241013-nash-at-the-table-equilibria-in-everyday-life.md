## Description

A friendly tour of Nash equilibriumâ€”the point where everyone's choice is best given what others do. We translate the math into everyday storiesâ€”from traffic and pricing to coordination games and the Prisonerâ€™s Dilemmaâ€”explaining pure vs. mixed strategies and why rational self-interest can lead to surprising, sometimes suboptimal outcomes for the group.

## Transcript

Alright, we've got a fun one today. Nash equilibrium. Ever heard of it? It sounds kind of complex, maybe like some high-level economics thing, but honestly it's everywhere. We're talking economics, we're talking politics, even just like everyday decisions. And you know what? You sent in some stuff from Wikipedia on this, so that's perfect. We're going to use that and really dive deep. And that's what's so cool about Nash equilibrium. It's this like really elegant idea that you find just popping up in the strangest places and most of the time we don't even realize it. Totally. So, okay, let's back up for a second. What exactly is this whole Nash equilibrium thing? Think of it like, okay, picture a standoff, right? Like nobody wants to back down because if they do it's going to be worse for them. Even if they had like a time machine to go back and change their mind, they wouldn't. Everyone's kind of stuck. You got it. To put it a little more formally, it's when you got a situation, like a game, where everyone's chosen a strategy and nobody can do better by switching things up. You know, how someone else changes their strategy too. No room for solo improvement. Gotcha. Okay, that makes sense. But can we get a real world example in here to really see how this plays out? Because the Wikipedia stuff you sent mentioned something called the coordination game. Oh, perfect example. Imagine you're driving towards another car, right? Head on. Total disaster about to happen. You both got to swerve to, you know, avoid becoming a headline. But which way do you go? Left or right? And the kicker is you got to make that choice knowing the other driver's got the same dilemma, right? Talk about pressure. Exactly. So if you both swerve left, boom, Nash equilibrium. You both avoid the crash. Everyone wins. Best possible outcome. Same thing if you both swerve right. But if one of you goes left and the other goes right, yeah, not so good. So in this case, two totally valid Nash equilibria, left, left or right, right. But it doesn't always work out so cleanly, does it? Because the article also mentioned these things called like pure and mixed strategies. And that's where it gets kind of fuzzy for me. Yeah, you're right. It can get a little more complex. So like with our driving example, a pure strategy is what we just talked about. Pick a direction, commit, that's it. But mixed strategies, that's where it gets a little more, well, interesting. It's not about just randomly picking something though. It's more calculated. So less about flipping a coin in the driver's seat and more about what exactly? Think about it like this. It's you're trying to figure out the odds, the probabilities that make any choice you make basically unattractive to your opponent. Like you want to make them go, well, if I do this, then that might happen. But if I do that, you want them stuck. A good example is a poker player, right? Sometimes they bluff, sometimes they don't. It's harder to guess their strategy because they're mixing things up based on how likely they think they are to win or lose. Okay, that clicks. It's like in tennis when a player mixes up their serves, you know, keeps the other person guessing. But why even bother with that unpredictability? Wouldn't sticking to one solid plan be better? It's all about stability. Let's rewind back to our driving example. If both drivers are like 100% certain about swerving one way, even if it seems counterintuitive, that's actually more stable than if they were both 50-50 on which way to go. Because even a tiny error in judgment or like a gust of wind or something could spell disaster if they're not totally in sync. Okay, so that's how Nash equilibrium works in a, well, you know, life or death driving scenario. But it feels like this concept is way bigger than just avoiding car crashes, right? Like in the Wikipedia excerpts you sent, it talked about using this for way more than just that. Oh, absolutely. Nash equilibrium, it's everywhere. We see it in how networks are designed, how resources are shared, even in how cities are planned. One really cool example is something called Brace's Paradox. Have you heard of that? Oh, yeah. That's the one where like common sense goes out the window, right? Like you think more roads would equal less traffic, but that's not always how it works out. Exactly. And that's the paradox. It all comes down to this. When you add a new road, drivers, because they want to minimize their own travel time, will often all try to use that new road and it actually makes traffic worse overall. It's not just a traffic thing either. This pops up all over the place. Like I said, networks, resource allocation, city planning, you name it. That's why understanding these kind of unintended consequences is so important. It's not enough to just throw more resources at a problem. We got to think about how people will actually behave, you know? So we've got traffic all figured out. What else can we use Nash equilibrium for? Well, the Wikipedia article also mentions competition, which is another area where Nash equilibrium really comes into play. Right, because even when you're talking about like hardcore business deals, there's got to be some kind of equilibrium, right? Otherwise, the whole thing just explodes. Precisely. Let's say you've got two companies, right? And they're both going head to head trying to grab the same market share. They've each got to decide how much to produce, but they also know if they make too much, the price is going to tank and everyone loses. So it's like our driving example from earlier. Only now, instead of swerving, they're like battling it out with pricing guns. A very apt analogy. There's actually a simplified version of this in the Wikipedia article. They call it the competition game. Basically, you've got players choosing numbers and the lowest number wins. They don't want to pick too high of a number or they'll lose for sure, but they also don't want to go too low because then their opponent might undercut them. Okay, so what's the winning play in that kind of situation? That's where it gets really interesting. In that particular game, the Nash equilibrium is actually for both players to choose the lowest possible number. Whoa, really? That's kind of counterintuitive, right? Like it seems like they're both leaving money on the table by not aiming a little higher. It might seem that way at first glance, but put yourself in their shoes. If one of them tries to get clever and picks a higher number, hoping the other player goes even lower, they risk a much worse outcome if the other player doesn't play along. So even in a super competitive scenario, there's this underlying pressure pushing them towards a stable state. It's like this weird balance where neither one wants to rock the boat. So even when it feels like the obvious answer is to aim for the most you can get, sometimes the most rational move is actually to go for what seems like the safest option. Exactly. And this actually highlights a really important point that a lot of people miss when they're talking about Nash equilibrium. Just because a Nash equilibrium exists doesn't automatically mean it's the best possible outcome for everyone involved. Sometimes you get what's called collective suboptimization, where everyone acting rationally in their own self-interest actually leads to a worse outcome overall. Okay, hold on. Now you've got me really intrigued. It sounds like we're about to get into the weeds a little bit here, exploring how sometimes the most obvious answer isn't always the right one. You got it. Remember, the whole point of Nash equilibrium is that each player is picking what's best for them based on what they think the other players are going to do. It doesn't consider the possibility that maybe, just maybe, there's a way for them to all do better if they work together instead of constantly trying to outsmart each other. Hold up. Are you saying that sometimes the best strategy is to just chuck the whole strategy thing out the window and just try to be nice and cooperate? Not quite, but it is super important to realize that the most optimal outcome, at least from a purely self-interested point of view, might not actually be the best thing for the group as a whole. Do you have an example to illustrate this? I think it would really help to see this concept in action to really grasp it. Absolutely. Now, it's not mentioned specifically in the Wikipedia article you sent, but probably the most famous example of this is the prisoner's dilemma. Oh, yeah. The classic. I'm familiar with this one, but for the sake of anyone listening who might not be, could you give us a quick refresher? Sure. So imagine you've got two suspects, right? They've been arrested for a crime and they're being interrogated in separate rooms. Each suspect has a choice. Stay silent or betray the other one by confessing. Here's the thing. If they both stay silent, they both get a pretty light sentence, let's say one year. But if one of them betrays the other, the one who talked goes free and the silent one gets slammed with like a five-year sentence. And if they both betray each other, they both get a medium sentence, maybe three years. So there's a big incentive to be the first one to squeal, but also a huge risk if you talk and your partner stays quiet. Exactly. And that, my friend, is the dilemma. What's fascinating from a game theory perspective is that the Nash equilibrium in this scenario is actually for both prisoners to betray each other. Wait, really? Why on earth would that be the most stable outcome? It seems like they'd both be way better off if they, you know, kept their mouth shut. Because they're both thinking logically, but in a completely individualistic way. Each prisoner is
