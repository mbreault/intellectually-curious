## Transcript

Welcome to our deep dive on protactinium. You wanted to understand more about this element and the sources you sent over, history of protactinium, some Wikipedia articles, and our research paper about its applications. Those seem like a really good place to start. Yeah, they do. So let's try to uncover what makes protactinium so intriguing. Well, it's pretty interesting that even before scientists were able to isolate protactinium, its existence had been predicted. Really? Yeah, Dmitri Mendeleev, the guy who created the periodic table, he anticipated its presence back in 1871. Wow, so he knew there had to be an element between thorium and uranium, even though nobody had ever seen it. Exactly, and he even gave it a temporary name, eka-tantalum, thinking that it would resemble tantalum in its properties. Eka-tantalum, wow. So that sent chemists looking for an element that behaved like tantalum. Right, and that wasn't really the right approach. It wasn't. No, it wasn't really until the discovery of dubnium, the true heavier counterpart to tantalum, that the real puzzle piece slotted into place. I see, so focusing on tantalum was a little bit misleading then. Right, kind of led them astray. Okay, so when did scientists actually get their first look at protactinium? The initial discovery was in 1913 by Casimir Fijans and Oswald Helmuth Goering. Okay. And the isotope that they discovered, protactinium-234m, had a very short existence, a half-life of just 1.17 minutes, so they actually named it brevium. Brevium, meaning brief, I guess. It was just a quick little blip. But then, just a few years later, two separate groups of scientists, Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn in Germany, and Frederick Soddy and John Cranston in Great Britain, they found a much longer-lived isotope. Yeah, protactinium-231. Okay, and that was a pretty big deal, right? Oh yeah, this discovery was a game-changer. It really allowed us to understand protactinium better and also led to the name protactinium, literally the nuclear precursor of actinium, because it decays into actinium. Oh, that makes sense. So we have Mendeleev's prediction, then a brief appearance of brevium, and finally the discovery of protactinium-231. What happens next in this protactinium story? Well, isolating protactinium in its pure elemental form was quite a scientific feat. I bet. It wasn't until 1934 that Ernst von Gross was able to accomplish this, and he had to use a really complex technique. It sounds complicated. Can you tell us a little bit more about what von Gross did? Sure. He used a method known as the van Arkel-de-Boer process, which involves converting protactinium oxide into a halide, like a chloride or bromide. And then you heat that in a vacuum using an electrically heated filament, and this causes the halide to decompose, depositing pure protactinium metal onto the filament. Wow, so protactinium finally gets isolated. So where does it fit into the whole scheme of the periodic table? Protactinium is part of the actinide series, and it's right between thorium and uranium. A lot of its physical characteristics, as you might expect, are kind of in between those two elements. So what's protactinium like in its pure form then? It's a dense, silvery-gray metal. It's heavier and more rigid than thorium, but not as dense as uranium. Even its melting point is somewhere between the two. And its thermal and electrical conductivity are pretty similar to other post-transition metals. So its properties seem to kind of follow the trends of its neighbors. Yeah, it's pretty neat. That's really neat. Our sources mention that protactinium is pretty rare, even though it's sitting right between two fairly common elements. Why is that? So it's true that protactinium forms from the decay of uranium. But its most stable isotope, protactinium-231, has a half-life of over 32,000 years. Which may sound like a long time, but it's actually relatively short in geological terms. Most of the protactinium that was present when the Earth was formed has already decayed away. So what we see today is just a tiny, tiny fraction of what was once here. Exactly. It's a case of here today, gone tomorrow on a geological timescale. And the protactinium we do find, where is that? It mostly occurs in uranium ores like pitchblend. But even then, the concentration is incredibly low, just a few parts per million. Wow, so if it's that rare, how do scientists even get enough of it to study it? Well, for a long time, they really only could extract it from uranium ores. Which is a very difficult and expensive process. But luckily, another source has emerged. Spent nuclear fuel. Spent nuclear fuel? I wouldn't have thought of that. Yeah, certain types of nuclear reactors, especially those that use thorium as fuel, produce protactinium as a byproduct. Interesting. And in fact, two main protactinium isotopes, 231 Pa and 233 Pa, show up in these reactors. Although they're often considered undesirable and are actually removed. So it's rare and it's a bit of a nuisance in these reactors? Yeah, pretty much. I guess that explains why it's not used more widely. Exactly. It's the scarcity, the radioactivity, and the toxicity. All of those things really limit its practical applications and confine it mostly to research. So if it's not useful in the usual sense, why do scientists even bother studying it? What makes it so interesting to them? Well, that's where things get really exciting. Protactinium may not have conventional uses, but it actually holds incredible potential for uncovering secrets of the Earth's history. Okay, you've got to tell me more about that. This is fascinating. Protactinium-231, the isotope with that long half-life we talked about, is a bit of a time traveler. Okay. And scientists use it like a clock to date marine sediments, which allows them to look back in time as far as 175,000 years. 175,000 years? Yeah. How does this protactinium dating method actually work? It's all about the ratio of protactinium-231 to thorium-230 in sediment layers. Okay. Both of these isotopes originate from the decay of uranium, but they accumulate in sediments at different rates. Right. By analyzing the relative concentrations, scientists can actually pinpoint how long ago that sediment was deposited. So just by measuring these ratios, they can actually create like a timeline for these sediments. Exactly. And by studying the distribution of protactinium in these different sediment layers, we can figure out what ancient ocean circulation patterns looked like. Wow. It's like piecing together a puzzle of the Earth's past. That's pretty remarkable. So it helps us understand how our climate has changed over time. Right. And it's not just limited to oceans, right? Right. This dating technique can actually be applied to a lot of different geological processes, like the formation of mineral deposits. It's like a really useful tool for geologists then. Exactly. It's amazing how an element with no obvious practical uses can be so valuable scientifically. It shows the power of research and how even seemingly insignificant elements can have really surprising applications. Before we get too far into the science, I think we should talk about the fact that protactinium is highly radioactive and needs to be handled very carefully. That's a really important point. Yeah. Protactinium's radioactivity is definitely a double-edged sword. You know, it's incredibly useful for scientific dating, but it also poses some pretty significant health risks if it's not handled properly. So what are the main dangers associated with protactinium exposure? Well, protactinium-231, the isotope that's most often used, mainly emits alpha particles. And alpha particles are pretty heavy and they don't travel very far in air. Okay. Even a sheet of paper or your skin can stop them. That's good. So the biggest risk with protactinium is really from internal exposure. Okay. Like if you ingest it or inhale it. Right. If that protactinium-231 gets inside your body, those alpha particles can cause a lot of damage to the tissues and organs around it. Right. And you said that it tends to accumulate in the bones. Yeah. What happens then? Well, if it's incorporated into bone tissue, the alpha particles that are emitted can actually damage the bone marrow, which can lead to some pretty serious long-term health problems like bone cancer. So we really, really want to prevent any internal exposure then. Exactly. But didn't you also say that its decay products can be even more dangerous? That's right. It's really important to remember that actinium-227, the decay product of protactinium-231, is actually a lot more radioactive than its parent isotope. Okay. And it emits both alpha and beta particles, which makes it a lot more difficult to shield against. Right. And it also has a shorter half-life, right? So it decays more rapidly. Exactly. So even though we start off with protactinium-231, which is sort of mild, over time, that decay process leads to a much more potent radioactive mixture. So how do scientists make sure they're being safe when working with protactinium? It takes a multi-faceted approach, addressing both the element itself and the decay products. Okay. And it really starts with minimizing exposure. Right. Protactinium is usually handled in sealed glove boxes that are filled with an inert gas like argon to prevent any reaction with air or moisture. Oh, so like those things you see in sci-fi movies, the researchers working with the glowing substances
