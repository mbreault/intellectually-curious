## Description

A French-led team has recovered 22 colossal blocks from the Mediterraneanâ€”the actual stones of the Pharosâ€”plus a newly discovered gateway monument. This episode follows how archaeologists, engineers, and historians are using 3D scans, digital reconstruction, and advanced simulations to piece the lighthouse back together virtually, understand how it stood for 16 centuries, and why it finally collapsed in 1303. Weâ€™ll explore the Pharos Project, CNRS partnerships, and the broader story of bringing a legendary wonder back to lifeâ€”at least in the digital realmâ€”and consider what other secrets might still lie buried beneath sea or sand.

## Transcript

Welcome back. Today we're talking about something truly legendary, the Lighthouse of Alexandria. You know, one of those wonders that just, well, vanished. That's right. And we're not just looking back, we're actually diving into some pretty thrilling new discoveries that are quite literally bringing it back to life. Oh, really? So less history lesson, more like archaeological detective work happening now. Exactly. Our sources for this deep dive are reports detailing these recent breakthroughs. Specifically, there's an article about recovering these massive stone blocks from the Mediterranean. It's pretty amazing stuff. Okay, so our mission today is clear. We need to unpack what archaeologists have just pulled out of the sea, how new tech is helping piece it all together, and what this tells us about, you know, its incredible history, how it stood so long, and why it fell. Precisely. It's a story of rediscovery. All right, let's unpack this then. Where do we begin? Well, let's start with the really big news, the stuff happening right now on the seafloor. Okay. I heard something about a French team. Yeah, a French-led research team has just lifted, get this, 22 enormous stone blocks from the seabed. Enormous how? Like big rocks? More than big rocks. We're talking truly colossal pieces. Some are weighing in at 70, maybe even 80 tons each. 70 or 80 tons? That's staggering. Can you even picture lifting that? It's hard to imagine, isn't it? And what's really fascinating here is what these blocks actually are. Right, not just random stones. No, no. They've identified them as actual parts of the lighthouse itself. Things like the threshold, you know, the main entranceway. Wow. And huge base slabs, even pieces of the door lintels and the jams, the sort of frames to the doors. Foundational stuff. So actual building blocks of the lighthouse. And this is part of a bigger project, right? It didn't just start now. Exactly. This recovery work, it's actually building on decades of research. It's 30 years after the archaeologist Yannick Zamperur first found the lighthouse's remains underwater back in 95. Right, 1995. So a long time coming. Archaeology often is. But here's where it gets really interesting. They found something else too, something unexpected. Oh, what was that? Well, amidst the lighthouse pieces, they also identified parts of a monument nobody knew was there. A completely new monument. Apparently so. It looks like a gateway, probably from the Hellenistic period. And it has this very Egyptian-style door. So digging for one wonder and finding hints of another, that must have been quite a surprise. Definitely. And finding things like this, even unexpected things, it all feeds into the bigger goal here. Which is? Which is to digitally recreate the entire lighthouse. They're meticulously scanning and analyzing all these ruins. Digitally recreate it, like a 3D model. Exactly. It's part of a larger initiative. It's called the Pharos Project. They're working with the French National Center for Scientific Research on this. And I read they've already done quite a bit of digital work before these latest finds. Oh, absolutely. Over the last 10 years, the team has already digitized, I think, more than 100 blocks that were still underwater. So these new massive blocks, the ones they just lifted, they'll be scanned and added to that growing digital collection. It makes the picture much more complete. So you have all this data, these digital scans. What happens next? You can't just click rebuild lighthouses, right? Huh, no, not quite. The collected data gets handed over to volunteer engineers. They're with the Fondation de Salt Systems. Salt Systems. They do a lot of high-tech 3D stuff, don't they? That's them. They're experts in this kind of virtual modeling and simulation. They've been supporting the project for about three years now. So these engineers, they take the scans. And they essentially try to solve this giant ancient puzzle. They virtually reposition all these scanned blocks to figure out how they fit together. Wow, like the world's oldest, heaviest jigsaw puzzle. Sort of, yeah. But it's not just about putting it back together virtually. They're also planning to use simulations, really advanced simulations. To do what? To try and understand how the lighthouse actually collapsed back in 1303. What were the mechanics of the failure? Ah, so not just that it fell, but the physics of why it fell during that earthquake. Precisely. And if we connect this to the bigger picture, you see how multidisciplinary the Pharos team is. It's not just archaeologists. Right, you mentioned others. Yeah, you've got historians, numismatists. Numismatists, they're experts in ancient coins. Coins often had pictures of famous buildings on them, so they can provide clues. Clever. And architects, of course. They're all working together. And they're not just looking at the stones. What else are they using? They're digging into ancient texts. Descriptions of the lighthouse, written from the 4th century BCE when it was new, right through the 15th century CE after it fell. So combining ancient eyewitness accounts, sort of, with cutting-edge digital tech. Exactly. That fusion is what's so remarkable here. It's really changing how we can study these ancient sites. We can ask questions we couldn't before. Let's step back from the tech for a second. Remind us about the lighthouse itself. When was it actually built? Okay, yeah. We're going back to the 3rd century BCE. So very early in the reign of Ptolemy I, one of Alexander the Great's successors who ruled Egypt. And it was right there in Alexandria's harbor. On an island, actually. The island of Pharos, right near the harbor entrance on the Mediterranean coast. A very prominent spot. And it was... Big. Oh, incredibly big for its time. It stood over 300 feet tall. 300 feet? How does that compare to other things back then? Well, think about it. That made it one of the tallest man-made structures on Earth. Only the Great Pyramid of Giza was taller. Oh. So it wasn't just a lighthouse, you know, for ships. It was a massive statement. A symbol of Alexandria's power and a real technological marvel. Which raises that question, how did they build something that tall, that complex back then? The engineering must have been extraordinary. Absolutely. And perhaps even more extraordinary than the building was its longevity. Right. You mentioned it stood for a long time. How long are we talking? An astonishing 1,600 years. 16 centuries. Seriously. 16 centuries. Think about that. A structure built around, say, 280 BCE, lasting until the 1300s CE. It's almost unbelievable. Especially in an area known for earthquakes, right? How did it survive so long? It must have been incredibly well built. Or maybe just lucky for a while. Likely a combination of robust design and, well, perhaps some luck too. But it definitely wasn't immune. It faced huge challenges. Earthquakes, you mean? Yes. Multiple major earthquakes hit it over the centuries. We know it suffered significant structural damage in 796 CE, then again in 951 and 956. So it was damaged and repaired multiple times. It seems so. It was clearly resilient. But eventually, its luck ran out. That was the 1303 earthquake. It's the one often cited as the beginning of the end. It caused enough damage that the lighthouse, well, it stopped functioning as a lighthouse. So the light went out, basically. The light went out. And then just 20 years later, another powerful earthquake hit in 1323 CE. And that was it. That seems to have been the final blow. It destroyed much of what was still standing. After that, this incredible wonder just disappeared into the sea and faded into legend, really. Lost to history until the 20th century. Right, until archaeologists like Emperor began to systematically search for it and found the remains. And now you have the Pharos Project trying to truly understand it. Bringing its story back into the light, so to speak. Exactly. Filling in those huge gaps in our knowledge about its structure, its history, its final moments. It's a powerful story of both human achievement and vulnerability. So let's try and wrap this up. We've gone from its ancient construction, this towering symbol, for 1,600 years. Through centuries of earthquakes, its final collapse, vanishing beneath the waves. To being rediscovered in modern times. And now being digitally rebuilt using these incredible new finds and technology. It's quite the journey. It really is. And it highlights this amazing synergy, doesn't it? Yeah. Between digging into ancient history and using the most cutting-edge tech we have today. The project, like we said, it's not just about seeing what it looked like. It's trying to grasp how it was built, how it worked, and the physics of how it eventually failed. It really bridges the past and the future of archaeology, as you said. I think so. It really makes you think, doesn't it? What other wonders lost to history are still out there? Waiting under the sand or the sea? Waiting for the right technology, the right team to find them and maybe even bring them back to life, virtually at least. It's a fascinating thought. Imagine the secrets still buried. Secrets we could unlock just by connecting these old sites with new digital tools. The potential is just immense. A lot left to discover. Thanks for unpacking that with us today. My pleasure. It's an incredible ongoing story.
