## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. It's great to be back. Today, we'll be looking at A000086. Yeah, it's a really cool example of how, you know, something that looks pretty simple in math can actually lead to some pretty unexpected connections. Very interesting. It all starts with a congruence equation, x squared plus 1a0bn. So you're essentially trying to find values of x that when you plug them into that equation, the result's a number that's divisible by n. Okay, so for those of our listeners who might not be as familiar with modular arithmetic, could you break that down a little bit further for us? What does congruent modulo n actually mean? Sure, sure. Think of it like a clock. Okay. In modular arithmetic, all we really care about are the remainders you get after you divide. Okay. So for example, 9 is congruent to 2 modulo 7 because they both have a remainder of 2 when you divide them by 7. Okay, that makes sense. So in this sequence, if n is 7, we're looking for numbers that when we plug them in to x squared plus 1, they give us a result that leaves no remainder when divided by 7. Exactly. And if you play around with some numbers, you'll see that 3 and 4 fit the bill. Okay. So 3 squared minus 3 plus 1 equals 7. Right. It's obviously divisible by 7. And then 4 squared minus 4 plus 1 is 13, which also doesn't leave a remainder when you divide by 7. Interesting. Now the OEIS entry also mentions an equivalent form of the equation, which is x squared plus x plus 1 mod n. What makes those two equations equivalent in this context? Yeah, so the key here is that the roots of those two equations, they only differ by 1. Okay. So if you find a solution for 1, you can just add or subtract 1, and you'll get a solution for the other, at least in terms of the remainders modulo n. Okay, I see. So it's kind of like two sides of the same coin, just shifted a little bit. Right, right. Now, before we get into some of the more complex aspects of this sequence, let's talk about a really key property that makes it super interesting. A000086 is multiplicative. Yeah. So can you tell us what that means exactly? Sure. So it means that if you have two relatively prime numbers, let's call them m and n, the sequence value for their product, so m times n, is equal to the product of the sequence values for m and n individually. So why is this multiplicative property so important? What does that actually tell us about the sequence? It's important because it makes it way easier to understand the sequence. We only really need to figure out how it acts for prime numbers. Okay. And then from there, we can figure out how it acts for any number just by breaking that number down into its prime factors. That's a pretty neat shortcut. So let's talk about those prime numbers. The OEIS entry gives some very specific rules for how A000086 behaves at prime powers. Right. Can you walk us through those? Absolutely. So let's start with the simplest case. When we have a prime number p raised to a power e, so p to the e, if p is 3 and e is 1, meaning we're just looking at the prime number 3 itself, the sequence value is 1. Okay. However, if we increase the power of 3, so e is now greater than 1, then the sequence value becomes 0. Oh, okay. So for 9, 27, 81, and so on, the sequence value is always going to be 0. Exactly. Gotcha. Okay. Now for primes that leave a remainder of 1 when you divide them by 3, so primes like 7, 13, or 19, the sequence value is always 2. And what about primes that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, so like 2, 5, or 11? For those primes, the sequence value is 0. And you might have noticed something interesting here. All the values we've seen so far are either 0 or a power of 2. Now that you mention it, that is a really interesting pattern. Is there a deeper reason for that, or is that just a coincidence? It's not a coincidence at all. This actually hints at a connection to a really cool area of math called field extensions. Hmm, field extensions. I have to admit, that's not exactly my area of expertise. Could you shed a little bit of light on how those relate to our sequence? Sure. So in a nutshell, field extensions involve extending a set of numbers by adding new elements to it. Think of it like building an addition onto a house. And in this case, the solutions to our congruence equation can be thought of as living in certain field extensions of the rational numbers. So we're not just dealing with simple remainders anymore. We're venturing into the realm of abstract algebra. Exactly. And the fact that our sequence values are just 0 and powers of 2, it kind of suggests that the solutions to the equation, when they do exist, they form groups with sizes that are powers of 2. Wow, so it's fascinating how this simple equation about remainders can lead us to these much more complex mathematical concepts. Yeah, that's the beauty of math. It's all interconnected in these really surprising ways. Speaking of connections, I noticed that the OEIS entry mentions a link to another sequence, A001615. Yes. Can you tell us about that connection? Sure. So A001615 is a sequence related to something called the Totent function. And this function counts how many positive integers less than a given number are relatively prime to it. Okay. And what's interesting is that A000086 is always congruent to A001615 modulo 3. So for any given n, if we take the values from both sequences and we divide them by 3, they'll always have the same remainder. Precisely. Can you give us an example just to illustrate that? Of course. Let's take n10 as an example. The 10th value in A000086 is 2. And the 10th value in A001615 is 4. All right. Well, both 2 and 4, they leave a remainder of 2 when you divide them by 3. That's a pretty neat connection. It's like these two totally separate sequences have this, like, hidden relationship, a mathematical kinship. Absolutely. And the OEIS is just full of these amazing connections. It's constantly revealing these hidden relationships between mathematical concepts that you might not think are connected at all. Now, going back to what we were discussing earlier, you mentioned that the pattern of just having 0s and powers of 2 in our sequence, that hints at something deeper. You talked about field extensions. Right. But I'm still not entirely clear on how those two things are related. Okay, sure. It is a little bit of a jump, but it's definitely worth trying to wrap your head around. So you remember how I said that field extensions are basically like adding new elements to a set of numbers? Well, imagine you start with just the rational numbers. So all the numbers that can be written as fractions. Okay, got it. Now, let's say you want to extend this set by including numbers that solve certain polynomial equations, just like our congruence equation. Now, sometimes those new numbers can be expressed using just those rational numbers we started with. But sometimes you need to introduce totally new types of numbers. So interesting. So it's kind of like we're adding on a new wing to our mathematical house to make room for these kind of more unusual numbers. That's a great way to put it. And the way that these new numbers interact with each other, the structure of how you can add them together, is often reflected in the pattern of solutions to that original equation. So in the case of A000086, that pattern is the zeros and the powers of two. Exactly. The fact that we only see those values kind of suggests that the solutions, when they exist, form groups with sizes that are powers of two. Wow. It's like a little peek into how these extended number systems are put together. That's pretty amazing. Yeah. It seems like we've started by just counting solutions to a really basic equation, and we've somehow ended up exploring the structure of these abstract mathematical spaces. Yeah, it really does. And this highlights just how interconnected seemingly very different areas of math can be. Now, there's another fascinating connection mentioned in the OEIS entry. It's the sequence's asymptotic mean. Okay. What can you tell us about that? Right. So the asymptotic mean basically describes the average behavior of a sequence as you go further down the line. Okay. For A000086, it's about 0.367552. So if we look at larger and larger values of n, the average number of solutions to our original equation will get closer and closer to that number. Yeah, exactly. It kind of gives us a sense of how often we should expect to find solutions as n gets bigger and bigger. Now, remember that connection to A000086 we talked about before? Yeah, I do. Well, A00086 isn't just connected to that sequence. It also has connections to sequences that deal with polygonal numbers and even sublattice enumeration. So now we're talking about geometric shapes and lattices. This is really taking us on a mathematical journey. It is. And the OEIS is just a treasure trove of these types of connections. It reveals these hidden relationships between mathematical concepts that seem
