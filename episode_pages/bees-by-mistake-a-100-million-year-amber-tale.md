## Description

From a Burmese amber treasure, Discuscaepa apicula challenges the bees-vs-wasps story. We explore how a pollen-coated wasp sparked questions about bee origins, the fossil pollen from Disperflora roberti, and what convergent evolution reveals about ancient pollination networks. Plus, the beetle hitchhikers and modern inquilines in stingless-bee nests shed light on a long, interconnected history of flowers and the creatures that visit them.

## Transcript

Ever heard of a hundred million year old time capsule? Hmm, intriguing. Well, that's what we're diving into today. A story of ancient wasps, mistaken identities, and a whole lot of evolutionary intrigue. It's fascinating. Where do we even begin to unpack all of that? It all starts with a tiny creature encased in amber, Discuscaepa apicula. And let me tell you, this little wasp had scientists buzzing literally about the evolution of bees. Oh wow, bees. Everyone loves bees. So we're talking about some ancient bee ancestor then? That's what everyone thought at first. We're talking the Cretaceous period, a time when dinosaurs still roamed the earth. Picture lush forests in what is now Myanmar. And this tiny wasp going about its business, totally unaware it was about to become a scientific celebrity. Okay, I'm picturing it. Set the scene for me. What happened next? Fast forward millions of years, and this perfectly preserved fossil is discovered. Scientists were ecstatic. They thought they'd stumbled upon one of the oldest bees ever discovered. I can only imagine the excitement. A bee that old would have totally rewritten the evolutionary timeline for bees. But wait, you said mistaken identity. This isn't actually a bee. You got it. There's a twist. Turns out, Discuscaepa apicula, despite some initial appearances, is actually a wasp. A wasp? Wow, what a turn of events. So what kind of wasp are we talking about here? Specifically, a crabronid wasp. It belongs to a group called Crabronidae. Crabronidae, okay. I'm not super familiar with all the wasp families. What can you tell me about them? Think of it like a family tree. Crabronidae is a large subfamily of wasps, known for their diverse lifestyles and hunting strategies. It gets even more specific. Discuscaepa apicula actually belongs to a smaller tribe within that subfamily called Discuscaepini. Discuscaepini. So this little wasp helps us understand how all these different wasp groups are related, right? Their evolutionary history and all that? Exactly. But here's the thing. Even though it's a wasp, Discuscaepa apicula still holds some clues about bee evolution. Hmm, that's interesting. I'm curious, how can a wasp help us understand bees? You see, it exhibits certain bee-like traits, particularly when it comes to pollen collection. Pollen collection? Isn't that a bee thing? Why would a wasp be interested in pollen? That's where things get really interesting. Because it highlights this concept called convergent evolution. Convergent evolution. I vaguely remember that term from biology class. Can you remind me what that is again? Absolutely. It basically means that sometimes completely unrelated species can evolve similar traits because they're adapting to similar environments or lifestyles. Think of sharks and dolphins. One's a fish, the other's a mammal. But they both have those streamlined bodies and fins because they live in the ocean and need to swim efficiently. Right, so even though Discuscaepa apicula is a wasp, it might have acted like a bee because it was doing similar things in a similar environment. Exactly. And there's actually evidence for this bee-like behavior literally stuck to our little wasp friend. Evidence. Intriguing. What kind of evidence are we talking about? Remember how we talked about all the excitement surrounding the initial discovery? Well, one of the reasons scientists thought it was a bee was because they observed pollen on its legs. So this wasp was actually carrying pollen, but aren't wasps carnivores? What would it be doing with pollen? That's the million dollar question. And it's one of the reasons Discuscaepa apicula is so fascinating. It suggests that even 100 million years ago, some wasps were developing a taste for pollen. A taste for pollen? Hmm. So maybe they were using it as an extra food source? Or could this have been an early step towards them actually becoming specialized pollinators like bees? That's a great question. It's not quite a simple straight line from this wasp to bees. Discuscaepa apicula isn't a direct ancestor of bees, but it does offer a valuable piece of the puzzle. When it comes to understanding how wasps and bees diverged, and how some wasp lineages might have started down the path towards becoming the pollinating powerhouses we know as bees. So it's like a snapshot of evolution in action, showing us these ancient wasps experimenting with different lifestyles, and maybe setting the stage for the incredible diversity of bees we see today. Exactly. And there's another detail about this pollen that makes Discuscaepa apicula stand out. Okay, now I'm really curious. What's so special about this pollen? It's not just any old pollen. It came from a very specific source. Oh. Do tell. I'm all ears. The pollen grains found on Discuscaepa apicula are incredibly well preserved, and analysis revealed they belong to an extinct flowering plant called Disperflora roberti. Wow, that's amazing. They can actually identify the specific plant the pollen came from after 100 million years. It's incredible. It is. And it opens up a whole new window into the ancient world of pollination. So we've got a wasp acting like a bee, carrying pollen from an extinct flower. It really paints a picture, doesn't it? It does. What was going on in that ancient ecosystem? Well, it's possible that Discuscaepa apicula might have actually played a role in pollinating Disperflora roberti. It's a fascinating glimpse into a plant-pollinator relationship that existed in the time of the dinosaurs. Wow, that's incredible. A plant-pollinator relationship from the time of dinosaurs. Amazing. I know, right? This little wasp is more than just a case of mistaken identity. It's like a window into a lost world, a key to understanding the evolution of both wasps and bees. And it might even hold secrets about these ancient pollination networks. You're right. It's amazing how much information we can get from just one tiny fossil. What else is there to uncover about this little wasp? There's definitely more. Remember those 21 beetle larvae found alongside Discuscaepa apicula in the amber? Oh yeah, those little hitchhikers. Yeah. They had another layer of complexity to this already compelling story. I can't wait to hear more. Those beetle larvae. They really are a fascinating twist to this whole story. I know, right? They really caught my attention too. So fill me in. What's the deal with these larvae? Accidental roommates or was there something more going on? Well, to understand them, we kind of have to look at what we know about these types of beetle larvae today. You see, they're called triangulins. And in modern ecosystems, they're known for, well, they're kind of cunning. Cunning. Hmm. Okay, I'm intrigued. Yeah, they latch onto bees to get a ride to the bee's nest. So they use bees like a taxi service to get into their homes. Pretty clever, if a bit sneaky. Exactly. Once inside the bee nest, the triangulins feast on the bee larvae and their provisions. Oh, wow. So they're not just hitching a ride, they're moving in and eating everyone. That's a bit harsh. It's a strategy that's evolved over millions of years, really highlighting the complex relationships that exist between different species in an ecosystem. That makes sense with bees, but we're talking about a wasp, right? Do we think these triangulins were trying to pull the same trick on Discuscaepa apicula? It wasn't a bee, but it was carrying pollen. Maybe the beetles were fooled? That's a really good question, and it brings us back to convergent evolution. You see, it's possible that even though Discuscaepa apicula was a wasp, it was behaving enough like a bee, you know, especially with the pollen collecting, that it might have attracted these opportunistic triangulins. So a case of mistaken identity in the Cretaceous period. The beetles just saw a pollen-covered insect and thought, jackpot, dinner time. Yeah, precisely. Of course, we can't be 100% certain, but it's a pretty plausible hypothesis, and it really emphasizes the interconnectedness of this ancient ecosystem, you know? It makes you think, what other relationships might be hidden in those amber time capsules, just waiting to be discovered? Oh, absolutely. In this specific case, the triangulins and Discuscaepa apicula really gives us a glimpse into the long history of interactions between bees, wasps, and beetles. So even though our wasp friend wasn't a bee, it's still helping us understand bee evolution and all the different relationships they have with other creatures. Right, exactly. By studying these ancient interactions, we can get a better picture of how bees and their associates have co-evolved over millions of years. It's a fascinating field. Speaking of those relationships, you mentioned that these types of interactions, like with the beetles, they still happen today, right? Oh, absolutely. There's a group of beetles called Scotocryptini beetles that have a, well, they have a very fascinating relationship with stingless bees. Stingless bees and Scotocryptini beetles. Okay, tell me more. This sounds intriguing. Well, these Scotocryptini beetles are highly specialized to live inside the nests of these stingless bees. They have all sorts of adaptations to blend in and avoid detection by their bee hosts. So they're like tiny little con artists getting into the bee nests and living off the hard work of others. You could say that. They're what we call inquilines. It means they live within the nests of other species but don't really offer anything in return. They've evolved to exploit the resources and protection offered by the
