## Transcript

Welcome to today's deep dive. Wow, you really went all out gathering material on Pythagorean numbers and sequences, encyclopedia entries, Wikipedia, research excerpts, even a study guide. It really is fascinating how Pythagorean numbers pop up everywhere. It is, right? So today, different areas of math. We're going to try to figure out exactly what they are and why their properties are so interesting for someone like you listening who's interested in this topic. Well, I think the best place to start is by defining exactly what a Pythagorean number is. Okay. So imagine like a very exclusive club that numbers want to get into. But to get in, you have to pass this conjugate test. This is a special club. It is a special club, yeah. Okay. And that's the essence of a Pythagorean number. Right. It's a real algebraic integer greater than one. Okay. And all of its Galois conjugates have an absolute value less than one. Okay. Hold on. Yeah. Back up a second. Sure. What are Galois conjugates? Oh. I've heard of the golden ratio. Yeah. I know that's a Pythagorean number. Right. But so explain those two things. Galois conjugates? Think of them as like shadow numbers that are associated with each algebraic integer. Okay. They provide us with information about the properties and relationships of that number. Gotcha. So for example, the golden ratio, which is approximately 1.618, is a classic example of a Pythagorean number. Okay. Its conjugate is approximately minus 0.618. Okay. Which has an absolute value less than one. So that conjugate passes the test to get into the club. Exactly. Okay. So it's not just any number that can be a Pythagorean number. Correct. It has to have that. It has to have that special relationship. Relationship with its shadow. Yes. Okay. It's a Galois conjugate. Now you also mentioned that Pythagorean numbers are known for being almost integers. That's right. What's that all about? So this is where things get really interesting. The powers of a Pythagorean number get very, very close to whole numbers, to integers. Okay. And this all comes from the relationship between an algebraic integer, its conjugates, and their powers. Hmm. All right. Break that down for me. Okay. Because that sounds a little complicated for someone who maybe hasn't studied a ton of math. Let's start with the idea of an algebraic integer. Okay. These are numbers that can be solutions to equations that have integer coefficients. And if you were to take the nth power of an algebraic integer and all of its conjugates and add them all up, you'll always get an integer. But because the conjugates of a Pythagorean number are less than one in absolute value, as you raise them to higher and higher powers, those powers are going to shrink very rapidly. Gotcha. Which leaves the Pythagorean number's power as like the dominant term in the sum and pushes that sum very close to a whole number. So the Pythagorean number is basically taking over and pushing everybody else out of the way. That's a great way to put it. It's almost like they're trying to disguise themselves as integers. Like a mathematical magic trick. Exactly. So why should we care about this almost integer behavior? That's a good question. Does this have any real world implications? There are a number of implications. For example, if you need very accurate approximations for complicated calculations, Pythagorean numbers are very useful in fields like physics and computer science. Okay, so like for real world applications, they're very important. It's precise. They're kind of like the unsung heroes of precision. They also help mathematicians explore the idea of something called Diophantine approximations. Diophantine. Yeah, which is just the study of how closely you can approximate irrational numbers using rational numbers. Okay, cool. So they're almost like little secret agents giving us clues about the connections between these different types of numbers. That's fascinating. Yeah, I like that. It's a very rich area of study. Now, you mentioned Pythagorean sequences. Yes. And my notes here talk about a special recurrence relation. Right. What does that mean? Pythagorean sequences, much like the numbers themselves, have this very unique way of being generated. Okay. So they're defined by this very specific formula. All right. That involves what's called the nearest integer function. Okay. Which essentially just rounds a number to the closest whole number. Gotcha. And by applying this formula repeatedly, you can generate this sequence of numbers. So we've got these sequences that are kind of bouncing around, sometimes unpredictable, sometimes they're not. Exactly. That's actually a really good point. Is there a way to tell what kind of sequence we're dealing with? There is. Some Pythagorean sequences follow a very predictable pattern called a linear recurrence relation. And these are called recurrent E sequences. E sequences. Yeah. And the values that you use in these recurrence relations for these special sequences are called E numbers. And guess what? These E numbers can actually be Pythagorean numbers themselves. Oh. So we've got these sequences, they're kind of bouncing around, doing their thing. Yes. And the values that are guiding their moves can be these special Pythagorean numbers. Exactly. It highlights the connection between these two concepts. That's pretty cool. It is. So can you give us a specific example of a Pythagorean sequence? Yeah. Let's look at the sequence E7, 49 meters plus 15, where dem is any integer greater than or equal to 1. Okay. So in this notation, 7 and 49 meters plus 15 are the first two terms of the sequence. Right. And all subsequent terms are generated using that nearest integer formula. Gotcha. So we've got this specific sequence. Yeah. It's rooted in this world of Pythagorean numbers. Exactly. And it might or might not follow that predictable pattern, like a linear recurrence relation. Right. And that's what makes it so interesting. It's kind of like a choose-your-own-adventure story. Exactly. In number theory. That's a great way to put it. Okay, cool. So we've got these E numbers, and we put them into different sets. Okay. We've got sets E, H, S, and T. E, H, S, and T. Okay, set E includes all E numbers. Okay. H is a subset of E where the distance between multiples of that E number and the nearest integer decreases very rapidly. Right. Set S, our exclusive Pythagorean number club. And then set T contains what are called Salem numbers. Okay. Which are very closely related to Pythagorean numbers as well. Oh, interesting. So it's like a whole family reunion for all these different special types of numbers. Precisely. All right, now speaking of exciting. Yeah. Let's dive into the enigmatic set S. Okay. The exclusive club. Yes. For all Pythagorean numbers. Right. What makes this set so special? So set S has some remarkable properties. One is that it's a closed set. Closed set. What does that mean? It means if you have a sequence of Pythagorean numbers that's converging to a certain value, that limiting value has to also be a Pythagorean number. So they let you in. They let you in. If you can get close enough. Exactly. It's like the club has this very strict membership policy, but those who can get infinitely close, they're eventually let in. Right. And another interesting thing about set S, a famous mathematician, Carl Siegel, determined that the smallest member of this set is a number called the plastic constant. Plastic constant. Which is about 1.3247. Okay. And even more interesting. Yeah. The golden ratio, our star Pythagorean number, is not just any member of set S. Okay. It's actually the smallest limit point. It's showing off. Of the entire set. The golden ratio, it's like I'm not just going to be in the club. Right. I'm going to be the bouncer. Exactly. And that was proven by Dufresnoy and Pythagorean. Okay. So that really solidifies the golden ratios. Importance. This plastic constant. Yes. This sounds pretty interesting. It is. It's not as well known as the golden ratio. Right. But it's clearly got some clout in set S. It does. Okay, so tell me more. The plastic constant is defined as the real solution to the cubic equation. X I go by 1 equals 0. Okay. And one of the most interesting things about the plastic constant is its connection to architecture. Architecture. Math and architecture. It's true. Okay, we're going to have to. We'll delve into that. Dive into that. That's fascinating. A connection between math and architecture. Yeah. So this plastic constant, it's defined as the real solution to a cubic equation. That's right. The equation is X I by 1 equals 0. Okay. And the plastic constant, which is approximately 1.3247, is the only real number that solves that equation. Right. But what makes it even more interesting is that it has a special kinship with the golden ratio. Oh. They're like family. Okay, I knew there had to be more to this story. Yeah. Tell me about this family connection. So both the plastic constant and the golden ratio belong to a special group of numbers called morphic numbers. Morphic numbers. Yes, and these are real numbers greater than 1 that can be expressed in two very specific ways using positive integers. Okay, can you give me an example? Sure. So for the golden ratio,
