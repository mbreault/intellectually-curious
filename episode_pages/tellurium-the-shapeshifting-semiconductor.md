## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. We're diving into the world of tellurium today. Tellurium. It's an element and, well, we've got some scientific capers and encyclopedia entries here and honestly I had no idea that this stuff was so interesting. It really is. I mean, just think about this. It's rarer than platinum here on Earth, but way more common in the rest of the universe. Wait, what? That doesn't make sense. Why would it be so rare here but abundant everywhere else? Well, picture this. Billions of years ago, Earth still forming and tellurium, well, it's reacting with hydrogen, forming this volatile hydride and that's basically tellurium in gas form, you see. So it's like a, I don't know, like a cosmic fart. Haha, not exactly a fart, but yeah, kind of. This gaseous tellurium, it could easily just escape out into space, leaving very little behind on Earth. So Earth was just bad at holding on to its tellurium. It's like having a leaky bucket. But if it's so rare, how did anyone even find it in the first place? Oh, that's a great question. This is where the story is pretty interesting. Our story starts in 1782 in Transylvania, you know, the land of Dracula. Oh, spooky. Sounds like the perfect place to find a new element, right? Yeah. This Austrian mineralogist, Franz Josef MÃ¼ller von Reichenstein, he was studying gold ore and found something really strange. He spent three years analyzing it. Three years. Three years, wow. I can't even keep up a gym membership for that long. Right, he was super dedicated. He found that when heated, it released this white smoke with a radish-like odor. And if you diluted it with sulfuric acid, black precipitate. Talk about dedication. But, you know, even after all that work, von Reichenstein's findings didn't exactly make headlines right away. Right. It took until 1798 for another scientist, Martin Heinrich Klaproth, to officially isolate tellurium and give it its name. He called it tellurium after the Latin word tellus, meaning earth, which, now that we know how much escaped into space, is kind of ironic, isn't it? Talk about a delayed claim to fame, poor von Reichenstein. So, okay, we have this rare element, a cool backstory, but what does it actually look like? Well, tellurium, it's got a bit of an identity crisis when it comes to appearance. It's got two forms, crystalline and amorphous. Crystalline, it's silvery white, kind of what you'd expect a typical metal to look like. But amorphous, it's this black-brown powder. So it can be all fancy and shiny or comfy in its powder form. Sounds fashionable and practical. I like it. But I read that tellurium isn't just about looks. It's the properties that get really interesting, right? Absolutely. Tellurium is what we call a semiconductor. It's kind of in between a true conductor like copper and an insulator like rubber. But get this. Tellurium's conductivity, it can change based on how its atoms are aligned. And it gets even cooler. Expose it to light, it becomes more conductive. It's called photoconductivity. Hold on. You're telling me this element can change how well it conducts electricity just by rearranging its atoms? That's mind-blowing. What does that even mean for practical applications? Well, it means tellurium has the potential to be really useful in electronics, particularly in things like solar panels. But before we get into that, I got to tell you this story. It's the 1890s, the Australian gold rush. Miners in Kalgoorlie, they were so focused on finding pure gold that they were actually using a gold telluride mineral called calaverite as filler material. Wait a minute. You're telling me they were paving roads with gold? You got it. They didn't even realize it at first. I can only imagine their faces when they discovered they'd been walking on a gold mine all that time. Wow, that's got to be one of the most expensive paving jobs in history. But it makes you wonder, if tellurium is often found with gold, is that where we get most of it from? Actually, no. Tellurium and gold, yeah, they like to hang out together in nature, but most of our tellurium comes from refining copper. It's just a byproduct, not the main attraction. So tellurium's connection to gold, it's more of a coincidence than a major source. That's fascinating. Yeah, nature can be full of surprises like that. Speaking of unexpected pairings, did you know tellurium can give you some seriously bad breath? Wait, what? Tellurium breath. Now I got to hear this. Okay, so when tellurium gets into your body, it turns into dimethyl telluride. And let me tell you, this stuff has a potent garlic-like odor. Even just a tiny bit of exposure, you'll be smelling it for hours, maybe even days. So if you walk into a room and it smells like garlic, it might not be from lunch. It could be a tellurium chemist. Exactly. It's a funny quirk of working with this element. It's a good reminder, too, that while tellurium is fascinating, it can be toxic in large amounts. Good to know. I think I'll stick with garlic bread for my garlic fix. So let's move on to something a little more practical. How is this rare garlic-scented element actually used in technology today? Well, remember how we were talking about tellurium being a semiconductor and its sensitivity to light? That makes it super valuable for solar panels. Okay, so solar panels. We see them everywhere these days. How does tellurium fit into all of this? Well, there's this specific type of solar panel called a CDT solar panel. It stands for cadmium telluride. And they're becoming a pretty big deal in the renewable energy world. They're known for being very efficient at converting sunlight into electricity. Plus, they're cost effective. So tellurium is actually helping us go green. That's pretty awesome. Yeah, it is. And it doesn't stop there. Tellurium also has a big role to play in other types of semiconductors. We've got these things called compound semiconductors. They're kind of like the power couples of the semiconductor world. You take two or more elements, combine them, and you get enhanced electrical properties. Power couples, huh? I'm intrigued. Tell me more. Well, we've already met one. Cadmium and tellurium to create cadmium telluride for those solar panels. But tellurium can also pair up with other elements, like mercury, for example. You get mercury cadmium telluride. And this stuff is amazing for infrared detectors. Infrared detectors? Right. Like the ones they use in night vision goggles. Exactly. Those and a whole lot more. Thermal imaging cameras, medical imaging equipment. Tellurium is helping us see the world in ways we never thought possible. This is incredible. It's powering our homes, giving us super vision. What else can this stuff do? Get ready for this one. Tellurium is even involved in data storage. You remember those rewritable CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs? Don't tell me. Oh, wow. I'm excited in those too. Yep. They use a thin film made from a tellurium alloy. And this film, it can change its state back and forth between crystalline and amorphous when you heat it and cool it with a laser. And this phase change, that's what allows you to write data, erase it, and rewrite it again and again. So tellurium is basically a tiny shapeshifter that helps us watch movies and listen to music. This is too cool. It really is. Tellurium's ability to transform, it makes it incredibly versatile. It can change its conductivity, switch between states. It's a real multitasker. And with the demand for all this fancy electronics and semiconductors always going up, tellurium's role is only going to become more important. That makes sense. But something's been bugging me. We talked earlier about that prediction from the U.S. Department of Energy, the one about a potential tellurium shortage by 2025. If this element is so vital for things like renewable energy, isn't that a big problem? It's definitely something to watch out for. Right now, most of the world's tellurium comes from just a few countries. China's the main supplier. So this shortage, it really highlights how important it is to find, well, you know, more diverse and sustainable sources. So what can we do? Are we just, like, doomed to run out of this super important element? Not necessarily. Scientists are working on it as we speak. They're exploring more efficient ways to extract tellurium and even looking at recovering it from industrial waste. It's kind of like a high-stakes treasure hunt. Treasure hunt. I like the sound of that. So tellurium, it's crucial for solar panels. It helps us see in the dark. It stores our data. And it might even be in short supply soon. What else have you got for me? Okay, get this. Tellurium is also being looked at as a potential game-changer in thermoelectric devices. Okay, hold on. Thermo what now? Imagine a device that can just, like, directly convert heat energy into electrical energy. Or the other way around. That's what a thermoelectric device does. Wait, are you saying we could use tellurium to, like, harness waste heat, like from a car engine or something, turn it into electricity
