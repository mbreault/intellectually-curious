## Transcript

Welcome to a deep dive into a language that's often considered dead, but trust me, its story is anything but dull. It really is. We're talking about Latin. We've got a stack of fascinating sources here ready to go, all about how this ancient language still echoes through our world in ways you might not expect. It's true. People often think about Latin as this fixed, unchanging thing, right? Yeah. But just like any language, it has a fascinating journey of change and evolution, shaped by the people who spoke it and the world they lived in. Exactly. So to really get a feel for Latin, let's take a trip back in time to ancient Rome. Okay. Imagine walking through the bustling streets, you hear the clatter of carts, shopkeepers hawking their wares, the murmurs of political debate. But what language are they speaking? It's not Italian as we know it. Right. You're hearing Latin, but in its raw and vibrant form. Yeah. And this isn't the polished Latin of the Roman Senate or the words of Cicero. This is what scholars call Old Latin, the language as it existed centuries before those famous figures. It was the everyday speech of the people, full of regional dialects and constantly evolving. So no Shakespearean English here. We're talking about the language of the marketplace, the tavern, the streets. And one of the most intriguing details I found is that the oldest Latin inscription we have, dating back to around 600 BC, isn't even written left to right. That's right. It's called boustrophadon. They alternated the writing direction with every line, like a farmer plowing a field. It shows you how even the way language was written down was in flux at that time. That's a great visual. It's amazing to think how these early forms of writing give us a glimpse into a language still finding its feet. Yeah. But how did Latin go from these humble beginnings to becoming the language of an empire? Well, it all started with a group called the Latins, a tribe living in the lower Tiber area of Italy. Latin was simply their local language, but as the Roman Republic expanded, so did their language. Think about how languages spread today often through power and influence. Right, like English spreading globally with colonization. It makes sense that as the Romans conquered new territories, they brought their language with them. Exactly. Latin became the language of administration, law, and trade across the Roman world. It was how the empire conducted its business, communicated its laws, and even how its soldiers exchanged stories. But the Roman Empire was incredibly diverse. Did everyone in this vast empire actually speak Latin? That's a great question. And it gets to the heart of how languages work in diverse societies. Our sources make a key distinction between classical Latin and vulgar Latin. Classical Latin was the standardized, formal language you'd find in literature and official documents. It was the language of the educated elite, the kind of Latin you might study in school. So, Cicero's eloquent speeches, Virgil's epic poetry, that's classical Latin. But what about the everyday folks? What were they speaking? They were speaking vulgar Latin, which literally means, you know, common Latin. It was the language of the people, much more fluid and prone to regional variations. Think of it this way. If classical Latin is like Shakespearean English, then vulgar Latin is how we speak casually with our friends. I love that analogy. You wouldn't order a pizza in Shakespearean English, just like a Roman farmer wouldn't be discussing the harvest in Cicero's polished prose. Exactly. And this is where it gets really interesting. While classical Latin might be what we mostly study today, it's actually vulgar Latin that holds the key to understanding the origins of the Romance languages. French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and many others. Wait, hold on. Are you saying that those languages all descended from Latin? That seems like a pretty big deal. Wow. It really does make you rethink those language family trees they show in textbooks, doesn't it? It does. It's like Latin is their linguistic ancestor. Yeah. But if these Romance languages were already starting to branch off, what happened to Latin itself after the Roman Empire fell? Did it just vanish? Not at all. It's a bit like how a family might spread out geographically, but they still share common traits and traditions. While the Western Roman Empire fell in the 5th century, Latin lived on, taking on a new role. This is where we get medieval Latin. Medieval Latin? Okay, so picture this. Europe after the fall of Rome was a very fragmented place. You've got different kingdoms and cultures emerging, and those Romance languages we talked about are really starting to develop their own distinct identities. So where does medieval Latin fit into all of this? Imagine it this way. Even with all this political and linguistic change, there was still a need for a common language, especially in the world of scholarship, religion, and diplomacy. Medieval Latin stepped in to fill that role. So even though it was no longer the main spoken language for everyday people, it still served as this common thread connecting scholars across Europe. Exactly. It's like their linguistic common ground, right? Yeah. Think about it. A scholar in England might need to correspond with a monk in Italy, or a diplomat might need to negotiate a treaty. Medieval Latin provided a way for them to communicate. Fascinating. It's like Latin became this key that unlocked knowledge and facilitated communication across borders during a time of great change. But how similar was medieval Latin to the classical Latin of Cicero or Virgil? I mean, language evolves, right? Absolutely. Think of it like a building that gets remodeled over time. The core structure is still there, but there are additions, renovations, maybe even a fresh coat of paint. Medieval Latin retained much of the grammatical structure of classical Latin, but it also became more flexible, incorporating words and phrases from other languages. So a bit less strict about the rules then. Exactly. And it makes sense when you consider how cultural exchange works. As different groups interacted, their languages inevitably influenced one another. Even today, we see how new words and expressions constantly enter our vocabulary. That's so true. It's like how that word breaches, you know, like pants came into English. It's actually from the Celtic word brachy. Our sources say the Romans adopted it and eventually it became part of the English language. It's a great example of how even a simple word can reveal these fascinating historical and linguistic connections. And speaking of connections, here's a fun fact. Did you know that Switzerland still uses Helvetia, the Latin name for their country, on their coins? That's so cool. A little nod to the past right there on their currency. But even with medieval Latin going strong in these spheres of life, did anyone actually speak it during this time? Were there secret societies of Latin speakers hiding out in monasteries, debating philosophy in hushed tones? It's a fun image to imagine. While there might have been some individuals who were fluent in spoken Latin, for the most part, it primarily existed as a written language during the Middle Ages. Think of it as the language of books, manuscripts, and official documents, rather than the language of everyday conversation. Okay, so we've got Latin evolving into the Romance languages on one hand, and then this more scholarly, almost monastic form of Latin keeping knowledge and communication flowing on the other. Right. It seems like Latin had a pretty impressive post-Roman life. But knowing history, I'm guessing the story doesn't end there. You know it. Just when you think you've got Latin all figured out, it throws another twist into the plot. As Europe emerges from the Middle Ages and enters the Renaissance, we see a resurgence of interest in classical art, literature, and philosophy. And guess what played a key role in this revival? Let me guess. Latin makes a comeback. You got it. The Renaissance humanists were absolutely captivated by the ancient world, especially the Romans. They saw classical Latin as the pinnacle of language and expression, and they sought to bring it back to life, not just study it, but to speak it, write it, and create new works in the style of the ancients. So while medieval Latin was all about practicality and communication, Renaissance Latin was more about aesthetics and recapturing a lost ideal. Sort of like how Renaissance artists were inspired by the beauty of Roman statues and architecture. A great connection. And this renewed passion for classical Latin led to what scholars call Neo-Latin, which literally means new Latin. It was a conscious effort to revive and adapt classical Latin for the Renaissance world. It sounds like they were remixing the classics, creating something new while still honoring the traditions of the past. Exactly. And Neo-Latin wasn't just a passing fad. It became the language of scholarship, diplomacy, and even science across Europe during the Renaissance. In fact, some of the most important scientific works of the time, like Isaac Newton's groundbreaking book on physics, Principia Mathematica, were written in Latin. Whoa. So even as late as the 17th century, when scientists were making incredible discoveries, they were still using Latin to share their ideas. I guess some things never go out of style. It's remarkable, isn't it? Even though Latin wasn't the common tongue of the people anymore, it held this special place in the world of knowledge and discovery. It's incredible to think how a language that originated with a small tribe in Italy ended up having such a profound and lasting impact on Western civilization. But eventually, everyone from scientists to philosophers made the switch to using their own vernacular languages, right? What happened to Latin then? It does make you wonder, doesn't it? Why did people eventually move away from using Latin so broadly? Was it just too difficult to keep up with? Well, it's not like there was one big announcement that everyone switched over from Latin to something else. It was a gradual process, and it's closely tied to the rise of national identities
