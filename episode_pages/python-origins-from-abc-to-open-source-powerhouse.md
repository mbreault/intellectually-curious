## Description

Join us as we uncover Python's origin storyâ€”from Guido van Rossum's ABC-inspired vision at CWI to the early prototypes, the BeOpen era, and the birth of the Python Software Foundation. Explore how readability, Lisp-inspired ideas, list comprehensions, and garbage collection helped shape a language that now powers everything from self-driving cars to digital artâ€”and why Python 3.0 marked a pivotal leap forward.

## Transcript

Ever typed a line of code and thought, wait, who actually dreamed this up? Yeah. Well, today we're going deep and I mean deep into the origin story of Python. Okay. One of the world's most popular programming languages. Absolutely. And get this, from self-driving cars to actual like artistic masterpieces, Python's got its digital fingerprints everywhere. It really does, yeah. But how did this all begin? It's, well, it's a fascinating journey. Python didn't just kind of appear out of nowhere. It's got roots, you see, in another programming language from way back in the 1980s called ABC. ABC. So I'm looking here and it says Python's creator, Guido van Rossum, envisioned it as a successor to this ABC language. That's right. So what's the deal with this whole successor thing? Was it like Python's older, wiser sibling? Yeah, in a way, kind of, yeah. Programming languages often, well, they build on what came before. Makes sense. The successes and the failures. Right. And Guido, he was at the CWI Research Institute in the Netherlands at the time and he saw some limitations with ABC and so he saw a chance to create something, you know. Even more powerful and versatile, yeah. So it's like taking the best parts of a classic recipe but adding a modern twist. Exactly, yeah. I'm intrigued. What kind of limitations? And what did Python actually bring to the table that was so new? Well, one key aspect was readability. Okay. ABC was designed to be beginner-friendly. Right. Emphasized clear, intuitive syntax. You know, Python inherited this focus on readability. So it was easier for, well, both new programmers and experienced programmers to understand and work with. That makes sense. Like if a language is easy to grasp, more people are going to use it. Absolutely, yeah. But like any good invention, there must have been some early prototypes, right? No, yeah. Our sources point to a version, Bort 9.0, released back in 1991. Absolutely, 91. Wow. And even in that early version, it had classes, exception handling, even those lists and dictionaries that Python's so well-known for today. That's famous for that. It came together remarkably fast. Guido, you see, he embraced that whole open source philosophy right from the start. Wow. Shared Python with the world super early on. So it wasn't some top-secret project hidden away in a tech giant's basement. Nope, not at all, no. That's really cool, getting that early feedback from other programmers, though. That must have been pretty important. It was critical, yeah. Even before version 1.0 in 94, Python was incorporating, like, brilliant concepts from other languages. One Lisp hacker in particular actually had a big influence. Interesting. They brought in Lambda, Map, Filter, and Reduce tools that make data manipulation, like, insanely efficient. Hold on. Lisp hacker. I've heard of Lisp, but it has a bit of a reputation for being, well, a tad on the complex side. Right. What's the story there? Lisp is, well, it's got this unique syntax, let's say. Okay. But it's had a huge impact. I mean, huge impact on programming. It introduced some really powerful ideas about functional programming. And these, well, Python kind of borrowed those concepts. It's part of what gives Python such incredible flexibility, actually. Think of it this way. Okay. If you've got to process, like, massive amounts of data. Yeah. These Lisp-inspired tools. Yeah. It's like having a high-powered engine at your disposal. Okay. I'm starting to see how Python, it cleverly integrated these borrowed concepts to become, well, kind of a powerhouse. Exactly, yeah. But then, you know, things took an interesting turn, didn't they? Yeah. I'm seeing here mentions of BeOpen.com. Right, right. And something called the Python Software Foundation. Yeah. Which sounds very official. It was a pivotal moment, really. Yeah. It went from this one-man, you know, passion project to this collaborative effort. Wow. With a much broader reach. So BeOpen.com, what was it? Like, why should our listener care? So BeOpen.com, it was this ambitious attempt to bring open-source software into the, you know, the commercial world. Like a bridge, almost. Yeah. Between that free-flowing world of open source and the more, I guess, structured world of business. Yeah. Guido and that Python Labs team, they were at BeOpen.com. Right. And they played, like, a crucial role in developing Python 1.6. Yeah. And then that landmark Python 2.0. Python 2.0. Okay, now that's a version that even I've heard whispers about. Yeah. Practically legendary, right, among programmers? Yeah, for sure. What made it so groundbreaking? I'm seeing in our notes list comprehension. Right, right. And garbage collection. Yeah. Intriguing but kind of cryptic. Yeah, so list comprehension, well, they're a perfect example of Python's, like, elegance and efficiency. Okay. Imagine, right, you want to make a new list from one you already have, but with, you know, some specific changes. Right. Well, in a lot of languages, you'd have to write this clunky loop to do it. Yeah. But Python 2.0, it took inspiration from these functional languages, like Haskell. Okay. And it introduced these list comprehensions, which is this, well, it's this concise, almost, like, poetic way to do the same thing. Interesting. It's like, well, it's like writing a single, really elegant sentence instead of a whole paragraph, you know? I like the sound of that. Elegance in coding is always, always win. For sure. But what about this whole garbage collection thing? Right, so garbage collection. Doesn't sound particularly elegant. No, but don't let the name fool you. It's all about keeping, you know, keeping things tidy. Right, okay. Programs, they use memory to store data. Yep. And when they don't need that data anymore, well, it's got to be cleared out, like taking out the trash. Makes sense. Garbage collection, it just automates that whole process. Okay. So you don't get these memory leaks, and it keeps Python way more stable. So it's like Python's automatic cleanup crew. Exactly, yeah. Making sure everything stays nice and runs smoothly. Keeps everything running nice. Smart. But we can't forget about the Python Software Foundation. The PSF, yeah. Or PSF. That sounds like a much bigger deal than just a company, even. Yeah, it is, actually. The PSF is, well, they're essential to the whole Python universe. Really? Formed back in 2001, and it's this nonprofit, right? And they're dedicated to fostering the growth and development of Python. Think of them as the, well, the guardians of the language. Okay. They hold the copyright, they guide development, they organize those big conferences like PyCon. Oh, right. And they just make sure Python stays this vibrant and open platform for everybody. So they're like the caretakers of the Python kingdom. Yeah. Ensuring its prosperity, guiding its future. The very apt analogy. I like it. One of their biggest contributions I'm seeing here was safeguarding Python's open source status. Absolutely, yeah. By making sure that the licensing stayed compatible with the GNU General Public License. Huge, yeah, huge contribution. That's huge. Keeping Python accessible to everyone. I mean, that's got to be critical to its continued success. Absolutely. Now, while the PSF was, like, you know, finding its feet, Python 2.0 was, well, it was making waves. It was. Our sources mention these versions, though, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3. Right. Did each update bring something new to the table? Absolutely. Python's always been about continuous improvement, you see. Okay. Each new version, it brought refinements, bug fixes, performance enhancements. Right, right. And, you know, every now and then, even entirely new features. So it wasn't just, like, bug fixes and that sort of thing? No, no, they added whole new features sometimes. For example, version 2.2, they unified Python's type system, which made it even more powerful and more object-oriented. Python certainly seems to love its objects. It does, yeah. But tucked away in all those version numbers is the one that really kind of shook things up. Yeah. Python 3.0. Right. Arriving in 2008, and it, well, it marked a major departure from the previous versions. Big time. This is where we get into breaking changes, right? Exactly, yeah. Python 3.0, it wasn't fully, what's the word, backward compatible with its predecessors. So code written for Python 2, in a lot of cases, it wouldn't run on Python 3 without, you know, some tweaking. You got it. I can only imagine what ripples that must have caused in the programming community. Why make such a drastic change? Wouldn't it have been easier to stick with, you know, with what was familiar? Yeah, well, it's that classic dilemma, isn't it? Balancing innovation with, well, with the, you know, the comfort of familiarity. Right, yeah. But sometimes to move forward, you've got to be bold, you know? You've got to address those underlying flaws. Right. Even if it means, you know, a little bit of a learning curve for everybody. Right. Python 3.0 tackled some, well, some fundamental design issues. They made the language cleaner, more consistent, and really prim
