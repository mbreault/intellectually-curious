## Description

We revisit the classic Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and its flexible counterpart SOQ, compare their assumptions, and discuss their relevance in todayâ€™s volatile world. From data quality and system design to advanced twists like imperfect items and memory effects, we translate theory into practical, realâ€‘world guidance for dayâ€‘toâ€‘day inventory decisions.

## Transcript

Welcome back to the deep dive where we explore all things supply chain, methods and technology. And today we're going back to the basics with EOQ. Yes, EOQ. Economic order quantity. A classic. Absolutely. And we've got a bunch of different sources today. We do. We've got some comparisons between EOQ and SOQ, some academic research even a little bit. Real world. About how this is applied in the real world. Yeah, exactly. And really what we want to do today is figure out, does this still hold up? Yeah. Is it still relevant? Right. What are the limitations? And maybe most importantly, how can our listeners use this? In their day to day. In their jobs. Yeah. So maybe we can start with, you know, we've got these two terms, EOQ and SOQ. Yeah. What are they all about? What are they, right? What's the difference? How do they work? Well, you know, it's interesting because they both kind of answer the same question, right? How much should we order? How much inventory? But they go about it in very different ways. So EOQ, it's all about the formula, right? You've got this equation and it's trying to find this perfect order size to keep your inventory costs as low as possible. Right. So you're balancing those holding costs with the ordering costs. You got it. I was looking at the sources we have and they actually have the equation in there. Oh, they do? For people to check out later. Very helpful. Yeah. So it's all about finding that sweet spot. Right. Where ordering too much costs you just as much as ordering too little. Ordering too little and having to constantly reorder. Exactly. You don't want to be doing that. But I'm already kind of seeing some hints here. Oh, yeah. About the limitations. Where are you seeing that? Of EOQ, right? And they're talking about stable demand and consistent lead times. Yeah. Which isn't really the world we live in. No. Yeah. Not really, especially these days, right? Especially these days, right. Things are changing all the time. Yeah. So that's where SOQ comes in. Suggestive order quantity. It's a little bit more, you know. Flexible? Flexible. Thank you. It relies more on systems and real-time information. So it's taking into account all those changes that are always happening. Yeah. So it's looking at your current inventory levels, what your forecasts are saying. Okay. Even how lead times are fluctuating. So it's almost like EOQ, you've charted a course and you're hoping that... You hope for the best. You hope for the best, but SOQ is kind of like... Like a GPS. Yeah. It's rerouting you based on traffic and accidents and construction. Exactly. Love that analogy. So it sounds like in our world today where things are constantly changing, SOQ might be a little bit better. It often is, yeah. But I don't want to dismiss EOQ entirely because this academic paper we have... Oh, yeah. This one's really interesting. It takes this idea of EOQ and applies it to a really complex situation. I know. I was fascinated by this one. Like way more realistic. It talks about like imperfect quality items. Right. So you don't always get... Not everything's perfect. Exactly. You've got defects. And it's not just identifying the defect. They go on and on about... They really break it down. The cost of storing the defect. The cost of sending it back. Sending back to the supplier. And then even what happens if you have shortages. Customer back orders. Yeah. They factor all that in. So they're really taking this basic idea of EOQ and expanding it. They're showing how it can work in a messier world. Yeah, exactly. The math in this paper is pretty impressive though. It is. Two different approaches. Uh-huh. They end up with the same solution though. Yeah. For figuring out how much to order and how many back orders to allow. What's the optimized profit? That's the goal, right? Right. But I think it shows that even with systems, you know, the sophisticated systems we have... Absolutely. Understanding the math behind them. It can give you a real edge. Can be really valuable. Yeah. And you know, one of the things I really took away from this... What was that? Was that they even talk about when it's not a good idea... Oh, yeah. To store those defective items. Like sometimes it's not worth it. Yeah. It costs more to store them. Than to just write them off. And to get any value out of them. Exactly. And they even talk about how to calculate a minimum selling price. Oh, yeah. If the supplier won't take those returns. If the supplier just says, no, we're not taking them back. You got to make sure you're covered. How much do you have to charge to make sure you're still making money? And then they even go back and show how all of this... It all kind of ties together. Ties back to that basic EOQ model. The classic EOQ. Yeah. But I also wanted to talk about this other paper we have. Because it has this really interesting idea. Oh, yeah. The memory effect. The memory effect. I love that they're bringing this in. Yeah. Using something called fractional calculus. Yeah. A little bit of advanced math there. I know. But it's such a cool idea. The idea is fascinating. Because they're basically saying... Yeah. That past demand fluctuations... Like what happened before. Yeah. What happened before. Can actually be used to make better decisions today. Yeah. So it's not just assuming that demand is always going to be the same. Okay. So instead of saying like, okay, last year we sold this much. So this year we'll probably sell this much. Right. It's like, no, but last year there was this huge spike and then it dropped. And then it went back up. So maybe... Maybe we can use that. We should be ready for that this year. You got it. Interesting. So it's like EOQ, but with a little bit more... A little more intelligence. A little more memory. A little bit more memory. Yeah. Yeah. And they use that fractional calculus to figure out, you know, how much weight to give to those past experiences. Okay. Like how strong should that memory be? Interesting. Yeah. And I guess what they found was that having some memory... Yeah. A little bit. ...is helpful. But too much... But too much. ...could be a bad thing. Is bad? Yeah. You can get stuck in the past. Right. Right. So it's like you want to learn from your mistakes, but you don't want to be trapped by them. Yeah. You need to be open to... New possibilities. ...new possibilities, right? Yeah. So it's all about finding that balance. Balance is key. Yeah. Yeah. In a lot of things in supply chain. Yeah. And I think this whole idea of memory, I mean, it could really apply to a lot of the decisions. Oh, absolutely. Supply chain professionals are making every day. Like thinking about, you know, past holiday seasons. Yeah. How did demand spike then? How do we prepare for this next one? Exactly. How much safety stock should we have? Yeah. You can use that past information to make smarter decisions. It's really fascinating. It is. And it shows how these kind of abstract math concepts... Yeah. ...can actually have real practical value in the real world. Absolutely. All right. So we've been talking about some pretty complex stuff, you know, imperfect items and memory effects. Yeah, we've gone deep. And fractional calculus, but I think it's time to bring things back down to earth a little bit. Yeah, back to basics. Yeah, we've got these other sources that talk about EOQ and SOQ in a little bit more practical terms. Right, more about how to actually use them. Yeah, strengths, weaknesses, implementations, you know. The nitty gritty. Yeah. What are some of the key takeaways from these? Well, one thing that really stands out to me is, you know, choosing the right inventory management system. Yeah. That's crucial. Because not all systems are created equal. Absolutely not. Yeah. You need a system that fits your specific needs. Right, like a system that works for a small company might not work for a huge company. Exactly. You've got to think about how complex your supply chain is. Right. And are you using EOQ? Are you using SOQ? Are you using some kind of hybrid? Yeah, what's the right approach for your business? Yeah. And then there's the whole data issue. Oh, yeah. Data, data, data. Because both EOQ and SOQ... They both rely on good data? They need good data. You put garbage in, you get garbage out. Exactly. So you've got to have accurate data on your demand, lead times, costs, all of that. Your system has to be able to handle that data. Right. It needs to be able to process it and make sense of it. Integration is key. Yeah. You want all your systems talking to each other. So let's move away from the theoretical for a second and talk about some real world examples. We love a good example. Because I know our sources have a few. They do. There's one about a bicycle manufacturer. Okay. I think it's really interesting. I'm intrigued. They make two different models. Okay. The Velociraptor and the Tyrannosaurus Rex. Okay, those are some awesome names. I know, right? All right, so what's the scenario? So the Velociraptor has pretty steady demand. Okay. Pretty predictable. So EOQ would work well there. Perfect for
