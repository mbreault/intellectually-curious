## Description

On this episode of The Deep Dive, we unpack Coinbase's August 2025 Outlook to separate altcoin season signals from ETH-driven momentum. We explain why Bitcoin dominance is falling even as the 90-day altcoin index stays muted, and what institutional ETH demandâ€”plus regulatory clarity on liquid stakingâ€”means for traders and investors. We also connect macro liquidity and potential Fed easing to the risk-on backdrop shaping crypto into late 2025.

## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive. Today we're jumping into a really hot topic in crypto, altcoin season. Yeah, seems like everyone's asking about it. Totally. And we're digging into the latest Coinbase Monthly Outlook report, the one for August 2025, to get their take. Good source for this. So the big question, right? Is this famous altcoin season actually picking off or are we maybe just seeing, I don't know, the early signs? It feels like our whole view on this has changed a bit. It absolutely has. You know, we talked back in March 2025 about that market thesis. Yeah, I remember. The one about the market bottoming and then hitting new highs. Exactly. And that largely played out, driven by, you know, better macro conditions. But yeah, the altcoin part of it, that view's definitely evolved. How so? Well, we haven't really seen that, like, broad retail frenzy yet, but there are some new tailwinds starting to blow for sure. Okay, maybe let's clarify for anyone listening. What's the usual definition? How do we normally benchmark an altcoin season? The common rule of thumb is when 75%, three quarters of the top 50 altcoins, by market cap that is, start outperforming Bitcoin. And that's over a 90-day period. Right, 75% over 90 days. So what's the data in this report telling us now? Where are we on that scale? Well, here's the interesting part. We have seen Bitcoin's dominance fall off. It was around 65% back in May 2025. Now it's down near 59% as of August. Okay, and that's usually a sign, right? Capital rotating out of Bitcoin. Like a classic early signal, yeah. Suggest money might be moving into alts. But the actual altcoin season index, it's still pretty low, like in the low 40s. Low 40s, so nowhere near that 75% trigger. Not even close. So that's kind of a puzzle then, because the report also says the total altcoin market cap has surged, right, up 50% since early July. That's huge, $1.4 trillion. Exactly, it's a massive jump. So if the index is low but the total value is way up, what's driving that? It can't be a broad altcoin rally then. It's not broad, no. That divergence is really the key story here. It seems to be mostly about institutional money piling into one specific asset, Ethereum, ETH. Ah, okay. So is an ETH story more than an alt story broadly? Pretty much. You've got demand from these digital asset treasuries, DATS, you know, big corporate crypto funds, and this whole growing narrative around stable coins and real-world assets, RWAs. Tokenizing real-world stuff. Yeah. And the report had some big examples of that ETH buying, didn't it? Oh, yeah. BitMined Immersion Technologies, they just bought 1.15 million ETH. That was part of a huge $20 billion raise they did. Wow, 1.15 million ETH. And overall, the top treasury companies, they now hold almost 3 million ETH between them. That's over 2% of the entire Ethereum supply. 2%, okay. That's serious institutional weight being thrown around. It really shows conviction. And what's also interesting is looking at the ETH betas. These are tokens like ARB, ENA, LDO, OP. They usually kind of amplify ETH's price moves. Right, so are they all booming too? Well, that's the thing. Only LDO, Lido's token, has really benefited significantly from this recent ETH push. It was up like 58% month to date when the report came out. Okay, LDO. And that makes sense because Lido is all about liquid staking for ETH, right? Yeah. A pretty direct way to get exposure. Exactly, simple exposure. And crucially, LDO got a boost from that US SEC staff statement on August 5th. Oh, yeah, the guidance on liquid staking tokens. Right. They basically clarified that LSTs aren't securities if they meet certain conditions like just providing the tech service, passing through rewards one-to-one. So ministerial services, not investment contracts. Precisely. But they did caution that if you start guaranteeing yield or offering extra returns, then it could become a security. Still, that basic clarity is huge. It removes a big uncertainty for institutions. Okay, so we have this institutional ETH focus. What about the bigger picture, the macro stuff? Are there wider economic forces helping this? Yeah, the report points to something pretty massive, a record $7.2 trillion sitting in US money market funds right now. $7.2 trillion? Yeah. Just parked. Yeah, parked, which is weird. Usually cash like that goes down when crypto goes up, but there's just so much uncertainty in traditional markets. Things look expensive, worries about growth. So tons of cash on the sidelines. But the catalyst could be the Fed, right? They're expected to cut rates soon, September, October? That's the expectation. And those cuts would make money market funds way less appealing. That $7.2 trillion is potential dry powder, could easily flow into riskier assets, including crypto. Makes sense. Lower yields on cash push people out on the risk curve. Exactly. And our own custom global M2 money supply index, which tends to lead Bitcoin by about 110 days, it's signaling a new wave of liquidity could hit late Q3, maybe early Q4 this year. So more money potentially coming into the system. Seems likely. We're already seeing crypto liquidity pick up a bit after declining for six months, partly because the stablecoin regulations are getting clearer too. Okay, so putting it all together, it sounds like maybe it's not altcoin season in that old school 2021 sense? Probably not, no. But the Coinbase report suggests the stage is being set for something. Maybe a more mature kind of capital rotation, focused, institutionally driven. I think that's a great way to put it. It's a nuanced picture. The optimism isn't just hype. It's backed by these macro shifts and real progress on the regulatory front, especially around ETH. It does paint a compelling picture, you're right. Definitely. So here's something maybe for you, the listener, to think about. With all this cash potentially waiting, this heavy institutional focus on ETH and regulations becoming clearer, what kind of new opportunities or maybe challenges pop up if that capital really starts moving in the next few months? How could that reshape digital assets for everyone? Definitely food for thought.
