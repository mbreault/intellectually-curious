## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. You know, today we're diving deep into the world of samarium. It's an element I bet you haven't thought too much about before. But trust me, it's more interesting than you might think. We've got excerpts from online encyclopedias and a transcript from a scientific podcast episode all about samarium. So let's get started. You know, it is fascinating how samarium shows up in some really unexpected places. From the technology we use every day to some cutting-edge medical treatments. Right. It's kind of secretly running the show behind the scenes. But before we get ahead of ourselves, let's start with the name. Because samarium has a pretty unique story when it comes to how it got its name. Yeah, that's right. You see, samarium is the first element to be indirectly named after a person. Colonel Vasily Samarsky-Bekovets, a Russian mine official. It was actually the discovery of the mineral samarskite named after the colonel that led to the discovery of the element itself. So it's not like he discovered the element, but his connection to the mineral that housed it earned him a place in the periodic table. That's pretty cool. But speaking of names, samarium is often called a rare earth element. Yet I've heard these elements aren't actually that rare. Is that true? You've hit on a common misconception. The term rare earth is a bit misleading. While these elements were initially challenging to isolate, they're not as rare as the name makes it seem. Samarium, for instance, is more abundant in the earth's crust than tin or iodine. It's about seven parts per million. So why the misleading name? Were early scientists just having trouble separating these elements? Exactly. It was the difficulty of extracting and purifying them from their ores, not their actual abundance, that led to the label rare earth. Interesting. So samarium is not so rare. And it has this unusual connection to a Russian mine official. But the discovery story itself, that was quite a saga, wasn't it? Indeed. Isolating pure samarium was like a scientific relay race. It spanned several years and involved multiple researchers. It all starts in 1878 with Swiss chemist Marc DelaFontaine. He mistakenly identified a mixture of elements as a new element called dosypium, and samarium was hiding within that mixture. So a case of mistaken identity right from the get-go. So who was next? Then came French chemist Paul-Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran. In 1879, he managed to isolate samarium from a sample of samarskite from North Carolina. A transatlantic discovery. But even then, they still hadn't quite found pure samarium, right? You're right. Early extraction methods often produced impure samples. It wasn't until 1901 that another French chemist, Eugene Anatole de Marseilles, finally isolated pure samarium. It took a team effort and some refined techniques to bring this element into the spotlight. So a multinational effort full of twists and turns. But what really sets samarium apart is its quirky personality, especially its ability to kind of shapeshift. Is that right? Absolutely. Samarium is allotropic, meaning it can exist in different structural forms. It's as if it adapts its appearance, depending on the surrounding environment. So it's not just a one-trick pony when it comes to its structure. What kind of transformations can it make? Well, at room temperature, samarium forms a rhombohedral crystal structure. But heat it up to 731 degrees C, and it transitions into a hexagonal close-packed structure. Then at a scorching 922 degrees C, it goes body-centered cubic. And if you combine heat, around 300 degrees C, with intense pressure, about 40 kBar, it forms a double hexagonally close-packed structure. Wow. It's like samarium is putting on a fashion show, changing outfits based on the heat and pressure. But wait, there's more, right? Something about color-changing crystals. Now that's just straight-up magic. It certainly is captivating. We're talking about samarium monosulfide, or SMS. This compound can transform from a black semiconductor to a golden-yellow metal just by applying pressure. Okay, now that's cool. But what's the science behind this chameleon-like behavior? How can pressure trigger such a drastic color change? It all comes down to the electronic structure of SMS and how it reacts to pressure. At normal pressure, it acts like a semiconductor, absorbing most visible light and appearing black. But apply some pressure, and you force the electrons in the samarium to rearrange. This changes how the compound interacts with light, causing it to reflect yellow wavelengths and appear golden. So a bit of pressure, a dash of electrons shuffling, and voila, a color transformation. But are all samarium compounds this dramatic? Do they all change color with a squeeze? Not quite. Samarium selenide and samarium telluride also show this semiconductor to metal transition, but it's a more gradual shift. SMS, on the other hand, makes an abrupt switch at just 6.5 kbar of pressure. And get this, if you scratch or polish a black SMS crystal, the pressure can trigger a golden transformation right before your eyes. Now that's what I call a showstopper. But there's this thing called hysteresis, right? Does that mean once it goes gold, it's stuck that way? Not exactly stuck, but it does play a role. Hysteresis means the pressure needed to trigger the color change is higher than the pressure needed to reverse it. So once SMS goes gold, it takes a bit more persuasion to bring it back to black. So it's not just a simple on-off switch. There's a bit of a lag in the transformation. But enough about the theatrics. Let's get down to business. We've got this shape-shifting, color-changing element. But does it actually do anything useful? Or is it just a scientific curiosity? Oh, samarium is far from just a pretty face. It has some surprisingly diverse applications in fields you might never expect. We're talking everything from electronics to medicine and even nuclear energy. Okay, color me intrigued. What's samarium doing in, say, my headphones? I'm guessing there's more to it than just looking pretty. You probably have samarium cobalt magnets to thank for the high-quality sound you enjoy. These magnets are incredibly strong, much more so than your typical iron magnets, and can withstand high temperatures without losing their magnetism. This makes them ideal for compact devices like headphones, but also guitar pickups, small motors, and more. So samarium helps us rock out and jam to our favorite tunes? That's pretty cool. But what about nuclear reactors? That's a whole different ballgame. What role does it play there? This is where things get really critical. Samarium-149, a specific isotope of samarium, is incredibly efficient at absorbing neutrons. It's a key component of control rods in nuclear reactors, essentially acting as the brakes on the nuclear chain reaction, preventing things from spiraling out of control. Okay, that sounds pretty crucial. But why samarium specifically? Aren't there other elements that can absorb neutrons? There are, but samarium-149 has a distinct advantage. When it absorbs a neutron, it doesn't become radioactive and decay, it just hangs out ready to absorb more neutrons. This makes it incredibly effective at controlling the rate of nuclear fission. Other elements like xenon-135 are also good neutron absorbers, but they decay relatively quickly, making them less predictable and harder to manage in a reactor setting. So samarium-149 is like the steady, reliable workhorse of neutron absorption. It just keeps on going, no drama, no decay, just pure neutron-absorbing power. Exactly. It's the element you want on your team when it comes to keeping those nuclear reactions in check. Wow, from rocking out to nuclear safety, samarium sure is a multitasker. But I also heard something about cancer treatment. Is that another one of its superpowers? Indeed. Samarium-153, another isotope, takes center stage in fighting certain types of cancer. It's the active ingredient in a drug called Samarium-153-SMEB-lexidronum, or Quadramed for short. It targets cancer cells in bones, primarily in cases where the cancer has spread from other parts of the body. So samarium is on the front lines of cancer treatment. But how does it work? Does it just zap those cancer cells away? It's a bit more targeted than that. Samarium-153 is a beta emitter, meaning it releases beta particles, which are essentially high-energy electrons. These particles damage and destroy cancer cells. To make sure samarium-153 goes right where it's needed, it's bound to a special molecule called EDTMP, which helps concentrate the radioactive samarium in the cancerous areas, minimizing damage to healthy tissue. So it's like a guided missile against cancer cells. That's incredible. And on top of all that, it's also used in chemical synthesis. Is there anything samarium can't do? Well, samarium-2 iodide, in particular, is a valuable tool for chemists. It's a powerful reducing agent, meaning it readily donates electrons, making it a key player in various chemical reactions. From headphones and guitars to nuclear reactors, cancer treatments, and even chemical wizardry, samarium is a jack-of-all-trades. But with all these applications, I have to wonder, where does all this samarium come from? Is it readily available, or are we talking about a scarce resource? That's a great question. And it leads us to the global samarium supply saga, which has its own share of twists and turns. A saga. Now I'm really intrigued. Tell me more. Welcome back to our deep dive on samarium. We've explored its history and some of its more dramatic applications. Now let's take a look at what makes samarium tick at the atomic level
