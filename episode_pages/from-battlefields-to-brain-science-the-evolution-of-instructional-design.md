## Transcript

Alright, so get ready, because today we're going deep, really deep into the world of instructional design. Cool. And, you know, you might not think about it, but it's something we see every single day. You know, from online courses to, you know, sometimes those frustrating assembly manuals, like how do they even come up with this? Right. But it's all thanks to instructional design. And I bet its history is a lot more interesting than we might think. Oh yeah, for sure. It's got some really unexpected roots, you know. It actually goes all the way back to, well, World War II. World War II. Yeah. Wow, okay. The US military. Now that is not something that I would guess. Yeah. What did soldiers and tanks have to do with how we learn today? Well, I mean, think about it. They had a massive, massive challenge, right? They needed to train millions of recruits and fast. Oh, for sure. For all these complex tasks. I mean, failure just wasn't an option. Right. So they had to turn to the experts, you know, psychologists and learning experts, to come up with like a systematic approach to training. So they were drawing on the latest research in psychology and even implemented, you know, rigorous testing to make sure their training programs were actually working. Wow. So it's pretty amazing how this wartime necessity, you know, laid the groundwork for this whole field of instructional design. That's incredible. It went from battlefields to classrooms. Exactly. Okay, so we had the military-driven approach. But how did that translate into like the instructional design models that we know today? Well, that's where these pioneering figures come in. In the post-war years, you had all these brilliant minds like Benjamin Bloom, B.F. Skinner. Huge names. They totally revolutionized how we think about learning and instruction. Like Bloom, for instance, he gave us this incredible framework, Bloom's Taxonomy. You've probably heard of it. And it's not just some academic term. It's really practical. So imagine you're trying to learn like a new skill, photography. Bloom's Taxonomy helps you break down that skill into these different levels of learning. From understanding the basics to like actually applying them creatively. Gotcha. Helps you set clear learning goals, measure your progress. That's super helpful, like a roadmap for learning. Exactly. It guides you through different stages. And then you have B.F. Skinner. He was all about programmed instruction. And he was basing this on behaviorist principles. His approach was all about breaking down complex tasks into like bite-sized chunks. Okay. You know, providing frequent quizzes, giving immediate feedback to reinforce that learning. Oh, like those language learning apps. Exactly, like Duolingo. They're totally using Skinner's principles. That's why I'm addicted to them. They tap right into, you know, that reward system with the little things. Exactly. And it wasn't just Skinner, of course. Building on all that, you have Robert F. Major. He came along and emphasized the importance of like clear, measurable learning objectives. Okay. His ABCD model. It's still widely used today. I've heard of that one. It basically makes you think about what you want learners to be able to do after the instruction. Gotcha. The conditions under which they should be able to do it and how you'll know if they've succeeded. So it really takes the guesswork out of learning. It's like a science experiment. You got to define your variables and then like measure those results. Exactly. Great analogy. And around that same time, you've got Robert GagnÃ©. Okay. And he was like the architect of instructional design. Gave us the nine events of instruction. The nine events. Yeah. And those are essentially the building blocks of any effective learning experience, really. So it starts with, you know, getting the learner's attention. Then you state your objectives, right, clearly. And then you got to systematically guide them through the material with practice, feedback, assessments. Okay. So his work really cemented this idea that instruction is a deliberate and carefully crafted process. Right. Not just random knowledge dumps. That makes sense. Okay. So we have Bloom's framework, Skinner's reinforcement techniques, Major's focus on objectives, GagnÃ©'s blueprint for structuring lessons. It all fits together. It does. It really does. It's amazing how these pieces all fit together. But what happened next? Did instructional design just become like this rigid set of rules based on these early pioneers? Not at all. It actually kept evolving. In the late 1960s, Michael Scriven, he introduced this critical new concept, formative assessment. And this is all about testing and refining instructional materials during the development process, not just at the end. So not waiting until it's too late. Exactly. Okay. It's like getting feedback on a draft of a paper before you turn it in. Makes sense. Right. Catch errors, make improvements along the way. That is so important. Course correcting before it's, you know, too late. Exactly. Okay. So it seems like it was really evolving into a more iterative and responsive process. Oh, yeah, definitely. And speaking of iterative approaches, the 1970s saw like this surge in all these different instructional design models. And one that stands out is the Guaranteed Learning Model, which was originally called the Instructional Development Learning System or IDLS. Yeah, mouthful. Yeah. It was developed by Peter and Mary Essoff. Okay. And this model took a very rigorous, like data-driven approach, emphasizing meticulous task analysis. Okay. Criterion reference testing, continuous validation. Wow. To ensure that the instruction led to mastery. No room for ambiguity. Yeah, they wanted to make sure it worked. So by this point, I mean, it was a pretty well-established field, right? But how did it make its way into the classrooms, you know, the training rooms? Well, that's where things get really interesting. While it was flourishing, you know, in the military and corporate settings, its journey into the world of education was a little slower. It wasn't until the 1980s with, you know, the rise of personal computers that we really started to see the potential for technology to transform learning environments. I remember those early days of educational software. Oh, yeah. We mostly used computers for, like, drill and skill exercises. Yeah, those were the days. Not the most engaging. True. But I mean, still, a game-changer, the personal computer. Oh, for sure. It opened up a whole new world of possibilities, delivering instruction, creating interactive learning experiences. It's like going from black and white to color, right? Exactly. But I'm curious, was this when instructional design started incorporating insights from cognitive psychology? You know, that's a great question because it seems like the growing field of cognitive psychology was starting to have a real impact on instructional design. Yeah. You know, understanding how people learn, how memory works, how we process information. Right. That became so central to designing that effective instruction. Right, because if you don't understand how the brain learns, how can you design effective learning experiences? Makes sense. So was this the time when behaviorism started to, like, be challenged by some of the newer learning theories? Yeah, you're on the right track. Yeah. The 1990s, you saw the rise of constructivism, which really challenged the more traditional, you know, behaviorist approaches. Right. Constructivism, it shifted the focus from memorization to actively building knowledge through experience and interaction. So less about passively absorbing information and more about constructing your own understanding. Exactly. That's fascinating. So it really pushed for more authentic learning experiences where learners could grapple with real-world problems. Right. Collaborate with their peers. Yeah. Construct their own meaning from the material. That makes a lot of sense. So this led to, you know, things like problem-based learning. Okay. Collaborative learning, inquiry-based learning. Gotcha. And even rapid prototyping came about. Oh, wow. Which allowed for quicker development cycles and, you know, improvements based on learner feedback. It's turning learners into explorers and problem solvers. Exactly. Instead of just passive recipients of information. That is huge. Huge shift. But then... The internet happened. The internet happened. And that changed everything, didn't it? Oh, yeah. It was like a seismic shift for instructional design. Yeah. Suddenly we had this incredible new tool for delivering instruction, creating interactive content, and connecting learners from all over the world. Yeah. Right? Hypertext, hypermedia, these became the buzzwords. I remember those days. We saw, like, the first wave of online learning platforms starting to emerge. Right. And with online learning came this concept of learning design. Yes. Where it was all about creating those engaging and effective learning experiences, but leveraging technology. Yeah. And learning design, it takes a more holistic approach. You know, it's not just the content, but also the learner, the technology, and the context. You know, where the learning is taking place. That's a lot. Yeah. And it often blends these different theoretical approaches, drawing on both behaviorist and constructivist principles. Okay. To create this really effective learning environment. We've gone from training soldiers to designing interactive online courses. It's quite a journey. What a journey. But where does that leave us today? What does the current landscape of instructional design actually look like? Well, one of the most interesting trends is the emergence of the SME designer. Okay. So we're seeing a lot more subject matter experts, you know, actually taking on instructional design roles. Interesting. So instead of just providing content to instructional designers, they're actually designing the learning experiences themselves. That is really intriguing. So it's like this blurring of lines between content expertise and instructional design expertise
