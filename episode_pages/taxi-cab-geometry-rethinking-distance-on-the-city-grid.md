## Description

In this episode, we unpack taxi cab geometryâ€”the Manhattan-like distance that governs city-block travel and grid-based spaces. We'll compare it to Euclidean distance, explore why circles turn into diamonds, how pi becomes 4, and why there can be many shortest routes between two points. We'll discuss real-world echoes in city planning, video games, and algorithms, and welcome a Fields Medalâ€“winning mathematician to guide the journey through this quirky, non-Euclidean world.

## Transcript

Imagine for a moment you're standing in, oh, say a big city like New York, you know, where the streets are all laid out in this perfect grid. You're at point A, you need to get to point B. Simple enough, right? But you can't just fly over the buildings. No cutting diagonally through a block, you have to stick to the streets. So how do you figure out the shortest distance then? It's something we kind of do all the time, maybe without thinking much about it, but this isn't just, you know, finding the quickest way to grab coffee. This whole scenario, it's actually the starting point for a really fascinating bit of math called taxi cab geometry. It's what's called a non-Euclidean geometry. Basically a different way of looking at space distance. And it can be pretty surprising. So our mission today is to unpack this taxi cab geometry. What is it? How is it so different from the geometry we all learned back in school? And maybe the coolest part, where does it actually show up in the real world? We'll look at things like city planning, maybe even video games. And we are incredibly lucky today. We have a truly brilliant mind joining us, an expert mathematician, actually a Fields Medal winner, to help us navigate this grid of ideas. Welcome to the show. Thank you. It's a real pleasure to be here. Taxi cab geometry is one of those areas that feels simple on the surface, but it really opens up a different way of thinking mathematically. Yeah, that's a great way to put it. Okay, so let's break it down. Normally when we think distance, we think straight line, you know, as the crow flies. Right. And that's usually tied to the Pythagorean theorem, right? That familiar D-E-A-B equals quus Y1, Y2, 2. That's our standard Euclidean distance. But what happens when the rules change? When you can't take that straight line? Well, that's the core of it. The definition of distance itself changes. In taxi cab geometry, sometimes called Manhattan distance, or the O1 metric, L1, we measure differently. Instead of that square root formula, it's simply the sum of the absolute differences in the coordinates. So D-T-A-B equals I1 by 2 plus Y1, Y2. Okay. This specific metric, yeah, it was formally laid out by E.F. Kraus back in 75, but the idea in the practical sense of it is obviously much older. It's how people naturally think about distance in grid-like places. Right, the taxi cab analogy you started with really nails it. You can only go horizontally or vertically, like city blocks, no shortcuts through buildings. Exactly. And what's mathematically interesting is that even though it's different, this taxi cab distance still behaves like a proper metric. Meaning? Meaning it follows certain fundamental rules. Distance can't be negative. It's zero only if you're measuring from a point to itself. That makes sense. The distance from A to B is the same as B to A, that symmetry. And crucially, it still obeys the triangle inequality. Ah, the triangle inequality. So taking a detour through some point C won't make your trip shorter than going directly from A to B. Precisely. D-T-X-Z will always be less than or equal to D-T-X-Y plus D-T-Y-Z. It's a consistent way to measure distance, just based on different movement rules. That city grid analogy really helps visualize it. So if we compare the two distances, the straight line crow flies one and this taxi cab one, how do they stack up? Is one always longer? Can they be equal? Good question. There's a clear relationship. The Euclidean distance, D-E-X-Y-Y, is always less than or equal to the taxi cab distance, D-T-X-Y. Okay, the straight line is always shortest, that tracks. Right, but they can be equal. They're exactly the same if, and only if, your two points A and B lie on the same horizontal or vertical line. Ah, so if you're just going straight east or straight north, no diagonal movement needed, then the taxi cab just drives that straight line distance anyway. Exactly. The path along the grid is the straight line path in that case. But as soon as you need to move both horizontally and vertically, like go three blocks east and two blocks north, the taxi cab distance, which would be five blocks, is definitely longer than the straight diagonal line you draw on a map. Okay, that makes sense. And here's another really interesting twist. In Euclidean geometry, between two points, there's generally only one shortest path, that straight line. Right. But in taxi cab geometry, there can be many shortest paths. Think about going from one corner of a rectangle to the opposite corner. Any path where you only move towards your destination, say only east and north, never west or south, will cover the same total number of blocks. You could go all the way east, then all the way north, or all north, then all east, or zigzag. Ah, as long as you don't double back, the total distance is the same. Precisely. The number of east steps and north steps is fixed. You just change the order you take them in. So multiple shortest routes. That's genuinely mind-bending. Okay, so if distance changes and the idea of a shortest path gets fuzzier, what does that do to shapes? Like, what on earth does a circle look like in taxi cab geometry? I have a feeling it's not round. You are absolutely right to suspect that. This is where things get visually weird, but mathematically consistent. A circle, definition-wise, is still the set of all points equidistant from a center. Okay, standard definition. But because we're using the taxi cab distance, the shape you get isn't round. If you plot at all points, say three blocks away from a center point, using this by 1 by 2 plus y1 y2 distance, you get a square. But it's rotated by 45 degrees. It looks like a diamond. A diamond? Not a circle at all. Wow. Not visually, no. Imagine standing at an intersection. All the points exactly two blocks away form this perfect diamond shape around you. Okay, I can picture that. But wait, if the shape of a circle changes that dramatically, what does that mean for pi? You know, the ratio of circumference to diameter. You've hit on one of the most famous consequences of taxi cab geometry. It forces us to rethink pi. In our normal Euclidean world, pi is about 3.14159. Yeah, the number we all know. In taxi cab geometry, if you take that diamond-shaped circle, calculate its circumference using taxi cab distance along its perimeter, and divide by its diameter measured along an axis, you get 4. Hold on, pi is 4. Just 4. Flat out. In taxi cab geometry, yes. Pi T, we sometimes call it, equals 4. That just feels wrong. How can pi be a nice, neat integer like 4? My whole mathematical upbringing is screaming right now. Uh-huh. It's a common reaction. It feels fundamentally strange because we're so used to Euclidean rules. But it makes perfect sense within the taxi cab system. Think about that diamond circle with radius r, meaning all points on the diamond edge are r taxi cab units from the center. If you measure its perimeter moving along the grid-aligned edges, the total length is 8r. Okay, 8r for the circumference. In the diameter. If you measure it across the center, say purely horizontally or purely vertically, it's 2r. Right, r units each way from the center. So circumference over diameter is 8r divided by 2r, which simplifies to 4. Huh. Okay, when you lay it out like that, it works. It's just... Wow. So pi isn't this universal constant across all geometries. That's exactly the takeaway. It shows that constants like pi are defined within a specific geometric system. Change the system, change the definition of distance, and the constants associated with shapes in that system can change too. It's a powerful lesson in mathematical relativity, if you will. Absolutely mind-bending. Okay, so circles become diamonds, pi becomes 4. Does this weirdness extend to other shapes too? Like, what about something basic like a line segment? Or midpoints? Oh, absolutely. The changes ripple through everything. A line segment, for instance. In Euclidean geometry, it's that single straight path. The unique shortest path. Right, but we just established that in taxi cab geometry, there can be multiple shortest paths between two points, A and B. Uh-huh, the zigzagging ones. So the set of points on the segment between A and B isn't just one line. It's actually all the points contained within the rectangle defined by A and B as opposite corners. Any point inside that rectangle lies on some shortest taxi cab path between A and B. So the segment becomes a whole rectangle. Effectively, yes, in terms of containing points on shortest paths. Yeah. And midpoints. If you're looking for points equidistant from A and B, well, depending on where A and B are, the midpoint set might not be a single point. It could be an entire line segment, or even a more complex shape. And things like perpendicular bisectors, the set of points equidistant from two given points, they don't look like straight lines either. They often take on these L-shaped or jagged polygonal forms, conic sections too, ellipses, hyperbolas. They all get this sort of blocky, squarish look when defined using taxi cab distance. It's like viewing geometry through a pixelated lens or something. That's actually not a bad analogy. It's geometry tailored to a grid. Okay
