## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into number theory. Today, we're exploring a concept that you might find surprisingly versatile, cosine similarity. It kind of bridges that gap between like the abstract math stuff and real world applications, and you see it a lot in data science and machine learning. Yeah, it's really a fascinating tool that lets us kind of gauge how alike two things are based on their direction instead of just their magnitude. So instead of like how big something is, we're more concerned with which way it's pointing. I mean, how does that actually work out in a practical sense? Well, think about it. Imagine you've got data points, but they're like vectors in a multidimensional space. And if two vectors are pointing in the same direction, they've got a high cosine similarity, even if their lengths are, you know, really different. And on the flip side, vectors pointing in opposite directions have a low similarity, even if they're the same length. Okay, yeah, I'm starting to see how this goes beyond just like simple distance measurements. Could you give us an example? Let's say we were comparing documents. Okay, so let's take two pieces of text about football. One is like a short news article, and the other is a super long blog post all about strategy. Even though they're really different in like word count, if they both use similar football-related vocabulary, their vectors in a word space would point in a similar direction, and that would give them a high cosine similarity. That makes a lot of sense. So how do we actually calculate this cosine similarity? Like what's the math behind it? So the formula uses the dot product of the two vectors, and then you divide that by the product of their magnitudes. And the dot product basically tells us how much the vectors overlap, and then the magnitudes represent their lengths. That's interesting. I'm curious, why is it so important that we divide by the magnitudes? It seems like we're purposely getting rid of information about how big the vectors are. That's a really great question. By dividing by those magnitudes, what we're doing is we're normalizing the result. So it becomes purely about the angle between the vectors, and that lets us really hone in on the shape or the pattern of the data, which a lot of times is way more relevant than the absolute sizes of the values. So the range of cosine similarity values is telling us something about the relationship between the directions of these vectors. Exactly. The cosine similarity, it always falls between minus one and one. If you get a value of one, that means they're perfectly aligned. Negative one means they're in opposite directions, and then zero means they're orthogonal, which is kind of like perpendicular lines. Okay. Now, in a lot of applications, especially with things like text analysis where the values are often positive, I know the practical range of cosine similarity is from zero to one. What's the implication of that shift in the range? That's a great observation. Yeah, in those situations, we're basically just focusing on how much the vectors align, and we sort of disregard the whole concept of opposite directions. It makes it easier to interpret and just assess how similar the data points are. Okay, this is all starting to come together. Before we get into specific applications, there's something that I found really interesting while I was researching cosine similarity, and it's a similar concept. It's known as the Otsuka-Okiai coefficient, and it actually showed up in a totally different field, biology. Yeah, isn't that interesting? It just goes to show you how a mathematical idea can transcend different disciplines. The Otsuka-Okiai coefficient, that was used to compare sets, like different species in different ecosystems. And the history behind that name is kind of a trip. There were multiple researchers involved spanning decades. Wow. It really is amazing how ideas can travel and evolve over time, and they eventually lead to powerful tools like the cosine similarity that we use today. Speaking of applications, let's switch gears and look at how this concept is actually being used in the modern world. Where do we see cosine similarity playing a really crucial role? So one area where cosine similarity is really powerful is in data mining, and it's especially useful when you're dealing with high-dimensional data. Like imagine trying to analyze customer data for a huge retailer. You could have thousands of variables for each customer, like their purchase history and demographics, their online browsing behavior and all that. Yeah, that's hard to even picture, you know, visualizing data in a space with thousands of dimensions. Exactly. And in those high-dimensional spaces, the traditional distance metrics, things like Euclidean distance, they can become less effective. So that's where cosine similarity comes in. It's less susceptible to the curse of dimensionality because it's focusing on the angle between the data points. And that angle stays meaningful even as the number of dimensions keeps increasing. So how does this angular focus help us find those hidden patterns when we're doing data mining? Okay, so let's stick with our customer data example. Say you want to group customers who have similar buying habits, but you don't care how much they spend. Well, cosine similarity lets you cluster customers based on the direction of their purchase history vectors, but it ignores the magnitude, which in this case would be the total amount spent. So you could have like a cluster of customers that are always buying electronics and another one that's always buying home goods and so on, even if their spending levels are totally different. That seems super valuable for targeted marketing. Absolutely. And for things like personalized recommendations, managing inventory, even just understanding customer behavior trends. But data mining, that's just one application. Cosine similarity is also really important in a lot of machine learning algorithms. Yeah, that reminds me. I often see the term cosine distance when I'm reading about cosine similarity. Can you explain what the difference is between those two? Sure, cosine distance is just a measure of dissimilarity. It's directly related to cosine similarity. You just calculate it as one minus the cosine similarity. So basically, if you have a high cosine similarity, you'll have a low cosine distance and the other way around. So it's like two sides of the same coin. Yeah. Sometimes it makes more sense to think about similarity, sometimes distance. It just depends what problem you're trying to solve. Exactly. And speaking of context, let's dive into how cosine similarity is used in machine learning algorithms, particularly in natural language processing or NLP. NLP is fascinating to me. It's amazing how we can teach machines to understand like all the little nuances of human language. So where does cosine similarity fit in with all of that? Well, in NLP, we represent words and even whole sentences as vectors. And using cosine similarity, we can actually compare the meaning of those vectors. This is crucial for stuff like sentiment analysis, you know, where you want to figure out if a piece of text is positive or negative or neutral. So we're basically training machines to understand the essence of language by analyzing the direction of these word vectors in this high dimensional space. That's incredible. It is. And it goes beyond sentiment analysis. You've got machine translation, information retrieval, chatbot development. Cosine similarity is a big part of all of those. For example, think about those recommender systems like the ones Netflix and Amazon use. You mean those suggestions for movies or products that we might like? I always wondered how those work. Well, collaborative filtering, that's a technique that drives a lot of these recommender systems and it often uses cosine similarity. The algorithm basically compares your preferences to other users' preferences to find people with similar tastes. And this involves analyzing these user preference vectors. And a lot of times cosine similarity is the go-to metric to quantify how similar those preferences are. It's pretty cool how such a seemingly simple mathematical concept can have such a big impact. It really is. And I'm starting to think that this is just scratching the surface. There's a whole world of more advanced variations and extensions of cosine similarity. Can you give us some insight into those more nuanced approaches? Yeah, for sure. Let's talk about the soft cosine measure. It's a really interesting technique that takes into account not just whether features are present in vectors, but also how similar those features are. Okay, I'm intrigued. It sounds like it takes the concept of similarity to a whole other level. Could you elaborate on that? So remember how we were talking about the soft cosine measure? It basically considers the similarity between features. Yeah, and you were saying it takes into account not just if features are in the vectors, but also how similar they are to each other. Right. Like in our document comparison example, with regular cosine similarity, each word is treated as a separate dimension. But soft cosine recognizes that some words are semantically related, even if they're not exactly the same. So like play and game are different words, but they're often used in similar contexts. Traditional cosine similarity wouldn't pick up on that, would it? Exactly. But with soft cosine, we can actually incorporate that semantic information. So instead of just looking at whether two documents have the same words, we look at how similar the words they use are. That's pretty cool. But how do you measure the similarity between words? I mean, it seems kind of subjective. Well, the key is to use a similarity matrix that captures the relationships between features. In this case, the features would be the words. And we can create this matrix using different techniques, like using pre-trained word embeddings. Those are like vectors that represent words and capture their meaning. Or we can calculate semantic similarity scores from lexical databases like WordNet. So it's like you're adding this whole other layer of intelligence to the similarity calculations. You're going beyond just matching words and actually getting at the meaning of the language. Exactly. And this results in comparisons that are more nuanced and more accurate, especially in NLP, where it's so important to understand the subtleties of language. It really shows how powerful and adaptable cosine similarity can be. This whole thing is pretty amazing. A simple mathematical concept can have such a huge impact. Before
