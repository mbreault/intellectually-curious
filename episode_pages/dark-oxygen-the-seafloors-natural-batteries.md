## Description

From the deepest oceans to icy moons, this episode follows the detective story of 'dark oxygen'â€”oxygen produced without photosynthesis. We explore the geobattery ideaâ€”natural electrolysis on polymetallic nodulesâ€”plus in situ benthic chambers and lab tests that show oxygen generation in the dark. We weigh skepticism, unpack the evidence, and discuss what this could mean for life on Earth and the search for life beyond our planet.

## Transcript

Welcome to this deep dive. You sent in some really interesting research about oxygen production, you know, down to the deepest parts of the ocean, the parts where sunlight can't even reach. We're talking about dark oxygen. And we've got a whole bunch of sources, scientific papers, news articles. There's even a Wikipedia entry in here. Wow. And it all kind of points to this wild idea, lumps of metal on the seafloor making oxygen. It really is a wild idea when you first hear it. Yeah. So what do you think? Could this be real? Well, what's really fascinating to me is that this kind of challenges how we think about oxygen, you know, how it's made. Right. I mean, we all learned about photosynthesis in school, right? Oh yeah. Plants and sunlight. That's the equation. Exactly. But these sources are saying there's more to the story. There's got to be more. Okay. So beyond plants, how else is oxygen made? Right. So besides photosynthesis, there are a couple other ways, like water radiolysis, for example. Radiolysis? Yeah. It's where radiation breaks down water molecules, you know, H2O, and it releases oxygen. And there are also certain minerals that can react with water. And guess what? That produces oxygen too. So there are other ways to get oxygen besides plants. Right. But these sources are pointing to something way bigger. Okay. So what is it? What's bigger than these other methods? It's this dark oxygen production, like happening on a huge scale, maybe even big enough to affect, you know, life on Earth. Really? And maybe even other planets. Whoa, other planets. Okay. Hold on. Let's back up for a sec. What exactly is this dark oxygen? Okay. So simply put, it's oxygen made without, you know, sunlight. So no photosynthesis involved. Exactly. No photosynthesis. And your sources point to two main ways this can happen. Okay. Abiotic, which means without living things. Okay. And then biotic, which means with the help of microbes. Got it. So abiotic and biotic. Right. So let's start with the abiotic stuff. You sent over this Nature Geoscience paper that really gets into it. And it talks about these polymetallic nodules. Yeah, basically lumps of metal found on the seafloor, way down deep. They're full of these manganese oxides and metals like nickel. Ah, okay. And get this, they might actually act like tiny little batteries. It's called the geobattery hypothesis. And the idea is that these nodules, because of how they're structured and what they're made of, can actually create, like, electrical currents. Okay. And these currents are strong enough to split seawater, you know, into hydrogen and oxygen. Wait, electrolysis? Like what we do in a lab, you're saying that's happening naturally on the seafloor? Exactly. And the really cool part is that the researchers actually measured stuff on the surfaces of these nodules, like the voltage. It's a pretty clever way to show that electrolysis could be going on. So they're down there measuring voltage on these metal lumps, and that's how they figured out this whole electrolysis thing? Yeah. Wow. Okay, but hold on a sec. How do they actually see this dark oxygen being made? Yeah. Did they have to, like, build a lab underwater or something? Well, they used these things called in situ benthic chambers. In situ benthic what now? Benthic chambers. They're like mini labs that they put right on the seafloor. Oh, okay. Yeah. And with these chambers, they could isolate a little section of the seafloor and then carefully watch how the oxygen levels changed, you know, over time. So they're just sitting there watching oxygen levels. Sounds kind of boring. Well, it's not as simple as it sounds. They were expecting to see the oxygen go down, you know, as the organisms living in the sediment used it up. Yeah, that makes sense. So what happened? Well, they saw oxygen levels go up a lot, which was a huge surprise. Whoa, wait a minute. So something else must have been making that oxygen, right? Right. And that's where things get really interesting, but they wanted to be extra sure that it wasn't just like a fluke or something. So they had to rule out a bunch of other explanations. You know, like maybe there were some weird experimental errors. Right. Or maybe oxygen was leaking in from somewhere. Or maybe it was diffusing from air bubbles. Makes sense. They even considered that maybe, just maybe, it was coming from the plastic of the chambers themselves. Wow, they thought of everything. They even thought it might be some kind of microbe making the oxygen. Oh, the biotic method we talked about earlier. Yeah, exactly. But they did a bunch of tests and ruled that out too. So they eliminated all these other possibilities, and they're left with what? These metal lumps making oxygen. It sounds crazy. It does. So how did they get from there to the, what was it, the geobattery idea? So it's like a detective story, right? Yeah. First clue. The more polymetallic nodules they saw in the chambers, the more oxygen they found. Like it was a direct connection. More nodules, more oxygen. Okay, so it wasn't just random. It was tied to these metal things. Right. And then the total oxygen being made was actually higher than what the sediment organisms were using. Yeah, like something had to be making that extra oxygen. Right. And then, of course, there were those voltage measurements. Remember those? Oh yeah, the ones on those nodules, right? Right. And those measurements pretty much confirmed that electrolysis was actually happening. And then, just to be super sure, they did those ex situ core incubations. Ex situ what now? Uh-huh, yeah, it's a mouthful. Basically, they took those samples from the seafloor back to the lab to do more controlled experiments. So they're taking pieces of the seafloor and putting them in a lab. Pretty much. And they found that even in the lab, those metal lumps were making oxygen. No way. So they're making oxygen in a tank. Yep, and they even tried it with just the nodules, no sediment, and still got oxygen. It all pointed back to those nodules. That's wild. So these metal lumps are really making oxygen in the dark. It is wild, isn't it? So they had all this evidence pointing to the same thing. Those nodules, those lumps of metal, were basically like natural batteries making oxygen in the dark. It's amazing what you can find when you just follow the science. It really is. But hold on, you mentioned earlier that some other scientists and even some mining companies weren't so sure about all this. Why were they skeptical? Well, anytime there's a big discovery that changes how we think about things, there are always some people who push back. Makes sense. So in this case, some people were saying, hold on, maybe you messed up the experiment. Like they didn't do it right. Yeah. Or maybe they read the data wrong. But Professor Sweetman and his team, they addressed those concerns, explaining everything very carefully. So they were able to back up their claim. Exactly. And in the end, their findings were just too strong to ignore. Sounds like one of those big shifts in science, you know, where a new discovery changes everything. That's exactly what's happening here. And this new understanding, well, it changes how we think about life on Earth and maybe even life on other planets. Okay, now you've got me really curious. I think we need to talk about all that in part three. All right, so we've spent a lot of time talking about how dark oxygen is made, all the experiments, all the evidence, the whole detective story. But now I want to know, why should we care? Like who cares about some weird reaction happening in the dark at the bottom of the ocean? Well, see, that's the exciting part. It's not just about some chemical reaction. It's about life itself, like how it works. For one thing, it challenges what we think we know about where life can exist. We always thought life needs sunlight, but dark oxygen shows us maybe that's not true. So you're saying there could be like whole ecosystems down there in the pitch black powered by these underwater batteries? Exactly. Imagine those deep sea creatures just hanging out, never seeing the sun, living off of oxygen from these metal lumps. It's a whole different way of thinking about what life can be like. Whoa, that's pretty wild. And this has got to have some pretty big implications for finding life on other planets, right? You got it. We're always looking for planets in that Goldilocks zone you hear about, where it's not too hot, not too cold, and there's liquid water, you know, like Earth. Yeah, the habitable zone. Yeah. Because life needs water and sunlight, right? Right. But what if life doesn't need sunlight after all? It opens up so many more possibilities. So maybe we should be looking for life in places we never even thought about before. Exactly. Think about those icy moons like Europa or Enceladus. They have these huge oceans under the ice, but it's way too cold and dark for photosynthesis. But maybe, just maybe, those oceans are full of life living off of dark oxygen. That would be incredible. So instead of looking for planets just like Earth, maybe we should be looking for planets with these kinds of conditions. It's a whole new way of looking at the universe. And it makes you think, what else is hiding out there? On Earth, even. I mean, if we found this, what else don't
