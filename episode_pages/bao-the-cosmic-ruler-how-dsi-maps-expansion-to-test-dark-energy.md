## Description

In this episode, we unpack baryon acoustic oscillationsâ€”the standard ruler carved into the distribution of galaxies. Weâ€™ll explain how the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument uses 5,000 robotic fibers on the Mayall telescope to build a 3D map of tens of millions of galaxies, measure the BAO scale at different redshifts, and translate that into the expansion history of the universe. By comparing the transverse (D_A) and radial (H(z)) BAO signals, we test whether dark energy has remained constant or evolved over billions of years. Plus, what this means for the Lambda-CDM model and future surprises.

## Transcript

Okay, so like one of the biggest mysteries in the universe is, right, this thing called dark energy. Yeah, it's pretty wild, really. And it's like making the universe expand faster and faster, but we don't even know what it is, you know? Exactly. We know it's there, we see the effects, but what is it? Huge question mark. And that's like what we're going to deep dive into today. We're going to see if it's, you know, always been the same or maybe it's changing like over time. Right, and we're looking specifically at these hints from, what is it? DSI, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Yeah, DSI. Pretty cool name, right? So for everyone listening, we're going to break it all down like what DSI is all about, what it's found so far, and why everyone's like kind of freaking out about it in the cosmology world. Yeah, it's causing quite a stir. All right, so first off, what exactly is this DSI thing? So DSI, it's an instrument. That's what it is right there in the name. And it's basically taking these like super detailed light readings from these really, really distant galaxies, like a cosmic census, but instead of people, it's galaxies. And this census isn't being taken from space, right? It's right here on Earth. Yeah, I got it. They actually retrofitted DSI onto an existing telescope, the Mayall Telescope, it's called. It's at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. They picked that spot because the sky is like super clear and dark up there, perfect for, you know, peering way out into the universe. Makes sense. So its main gig is figuring out dark energy then? Yeah, that's the heart of it. It's all about understanding how the universe has been expanding over time. And, you know, because dark energy is driving that expansion, by studying one, we learn about the other. And it does this by taking these, what we call spectrographic surveys of galaxies, you know, billions of light years away. Spectrographic, so it's not just like taking pictures, it's examining the light in a specific way. Yeah, exactly. Think of it like this. At the heart of DSI, there's this focal plane, and it's loaded with 5,000 like tiny robotic positioners. 5,000, it's kind of mind-blowing. Each one of those little robots can aim a fiber optic cable at a single galaxy. And the light that they capture is then sent to a bunch of spectrographs, which are basically like high-tech prisms. You know, they split the light into all its different colors. And by looking at that spectrum, scientists can figure out all sorts of things about the galaxy, like its redshift, how much its light has been stretched because the universe is expanding. That tells us how far away it is and how fast it's moving away from us. 5,000 little robots, that's crazy. So when did this whole thing get started? Officially, the main DSI survey kicked off in May 2021, and it's supposed to run for five years. So right now, as we speak, it's still collecting data. All right. And who's the brains and the money behind this whole operation? Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. They're running the show with a lot of support from the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science. And a bunch of other institutions are involved, too, from all around the world. So it's a real, like, global effort to understand these, you know, universe-sized mysteries. Right. And it's not just dark energy, right? It's also tackling a bunch of other big questions about, like, the nature of the universe. Yeah, totally. I mean, dark energy is the big one, obviously. But DSI is also trying to build these incredibly detailed three-dimensional maps of the universe, which would be, like, amazing to see. And from those maps, we could do all sorts of things, like really test Einstein's theory of general relativity, you know, or figure out the masses of neutrinos, these super tiny particles. We might even be able to get clues about the super, super early universe. So lots on the agenda. Okay, so how does DSI actually go about measuring the expansion of the universe? I remember you mentioned this thing, what was it, baryon acoustic oscillations? Oh yeah, baryon acoustic oscillations. BAO for short, because, you know, scientists love their acronyms. So imagine, like, right after the Big Bang, you've got this incredibly hot, dense plasma, and sound waves are rippling through it. Those sound waves create this kind of a pattern in how matter is distributed, and that pattern, it shows up in how galaxies are clustered together, even billions of years later. It acts like a standard ruler, a yardstick that's, like, imprinted on the universe. So we know how big this ruler should be, like, at different points in the universe's history. Exactly. And that's how DAI measures the expansion. It looks at how big that BAO pattern appears at different distances, which correspond to different points in time, right? Because looking farther away is looking back in time. And by seeing how much that pattern has stretched, we can figure out how much the universe has expanded over time. It's pretty ingenious when you think about it. It is. So how many, like, galaxies and things is DAI going to look at over the whole project? It's going to be a lot. Like, a lot, a lot. By 2026, they're expecting to have observed something like 40 million galaxies and quasars. Wow, 40 million. That's, like, 10 times more than the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, right? Yep. And Sloan took 20 years to do its thing. DAI is collecting data way faster. That's amazing. And all this data, it's not just, like, hidden away in a vault somewhere, right? Other scientists and even regular folks can get access to it. Absolutely. DAI is all about open science. They've already released some of the data publicly. They had an early data release back in June 2023. And then the big one, Data Release 1, came out March 19, 2025. It had, like, 18.7 million objects in it. Researchers anywhere in the world can get their hands on it, which is, you know, pretty awesome for science as a whole. Okay, so we know what DAI is, how it works. What's it telling us about dark energy? Like, what are the big findings from the first three years? So they look at about 15 million galaxies and quasars from those first three years. And the biggest finding, the thing that's got everyone talking, is that when you combine DAI's data with all this other evidence we have about the universe stuff, like measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, observations of distant supernovae, and studies of something called weak gravitational lensing, all together, it looks like maybe dark energy's influence has been, like, decreasing over time. Wait, decreasing? That's huge. Yeah, it's a pretty big deal. Because, you know, for the longest time, we've been working with this model of the universe called the Lambda-CDM model. And in that model, dark energy is like this constant thing. The cosmological constant, it never changes. And actually, if you look at just DAI's data by itself, it still kind of fits with that model. So when you put it all together, DAI's data with all the other stuff, that's when it starts to look like maybe dark energy isn't so constant after all. Exactly. It's that combination, that convergence of different types of evidence, that's starting to make people think maybe we need to, like, rethink our understanding of dark energy a little bit. So how sure are we about this? Like, are we ready to rewrite the textbooks? Not quite yet. I mean, it's definitely exciting, and there's a lot of buzz about it. But, you know, scientists are a cautious bunch. Right now, the data supports the idea of evolving dark energy at a level of somewhere between 2.8 and 4.2 sigma. That's a measure of statistical significance. To really, like, claim a discovery, you usually want to be at 5 sigma. That's, like, super-duper sure. So we're not there yet, but it's a really strong hint, you know? Like, definitely something to keep investigating. I see. So more like a promising lead rather than a done deal. But exciting nonetheless. Have the folks working on DSI, have they said anything about all this? Oh yeah, they're definitely paying attention. Michael Levi, the DSI director, he said that they're seeing some potentially interesting differences, is how he put it, that could indicate that dark energy is, in fact, evolving over time. He's careful to say that these differences might go away as they get more data, but, you know, you can tell he's excited to see what that data shows. And the other folks in charge, like the co-spokespeople, what are they saying? Oh, they're on board too. Alexei Lofev-Harnett, she's one of them, and she's, like, super pumped about the possibility of a big breakthrough in our understanding of dark energy. And Will Percival, he's the other one, and he's saying that, yeah, this could mean we need to, like, update our standard cosmological model and that, you know, evolving dark energy would fit right in. So everyone's pretty stoked about these hints then. Okay, can you walk us through again, like, how DSI uses that baryon acoustic oscillations thing, the BAO, to track dark energy across, like, billions of years
