## Transcript

Welcome, everyone. Ready for another deep dive? Today, we're tackling spherical trigonometry. Sounds a bit intimidating, right? Maybe a little. But don't worry. We've got excerpts from the Wikipedia article on spherical trigonometry to guide us. Yeah, and it's way more interesting than it might sound at first. We're basically talking about triangles, but not the kind you'd find on a flat piece of paper. So not the ones from high school geometry class? Nope. These triangles live on a sphere, which makes things a whole lot more, well, spherical. Okay, so curved surfaces instead of flat planes. Exactly. Think about it. The sides of our triangles are now arcs of great circles. It's like geometry on a whole new level. So if I picture slicing an orange, each segment would kind of be like a spherical triangle. You got it. And you know those spherical triangles? They're like the building blocks for even cooler shapes, things called spherical polygons. So we're talking about shapes made up of these curved triangles. Exactly. Now imagine like a five-pointed star on a ball where all the points are right angles. That's a spherical polygon called the pentagramma mirificum. That sounds pretty complex. It is, in a way, but also kind of beautiful when you think about it. Definitely. So before we get too lost in all these shapes, can we take a step back and talk about notation? How do we even represent these spherical triangles? Good point. Always good to clarify. So we use capital letters like A, B, C for the angles, and lowercase letters a, b, c for the sides. Makes sense. And anything else? Any assumptions we're making? Well, to make calculations easier, we usually consider the sphere's radius to be one unit. Okay, I can see how that would simplify things. Now I've heard about these things called polar triangles. What are those all about? Ah, polar triangles. They're like the alter egos of our original triangles. Every spherical triangle has a corresponding polar triangle where the sides and angles are kind of switched around. Switched around how? So the angles of the original triangle become the sides of the polar triangle, and vice versa, the sides become the angles. Kind of a neat mirror image thing going on. Interesting. So if we figure out some equation that works for a spherical triangle, could we flip it around and use it for the polar triangle too? Exactly. Any identity that works for a triangle also has a counterpart for its polar triangle. It's a cool symmetry that pops up in spherical trigonometry. Two for the price of one. Okay, now I keep hearing about the cosine rule. You mentioned it's like super important in spherical trigonometry. Why is that? Well, the cosine rule is like the key that unlocks a lot of doors in this field. It basically connects all three sides of a spherical triangle with one of its angles. Can you give us the formula for that? Sure. So the cosine of side A equals the cosine of side B times the cosine of side C plus the sine of B times the sine of C times the cosine of angle A. And we can switch that around for other sides and angles too. Okay, so it's a bit more complex than the cosine rule for regular triangles, but I see the similarities. Now, what about the sine rule? Does that play a role here too? It does. The sine rule in spherical trigonometry says the ratio of the sine of an angle to the sine of its opposite side is constant, no matter which angle and side you pick. And guess what? You can actually derive it from the cosine rule. So it's like a domino effect. One rule leads to another. Exactly. And you know, there are actually a bunch of other identities in spherical trigonometry too. Things like supplemental cosine rules, cotangent four-part formulas, half-angle and half-side formulas. Whoa, that's a lot to keep track of. Oh yeah, there's a whole toolkit of formulas to work with. And we've also got de Lombre analogies and Napier's analogies, just to name a few more. Wow, sounds like a whole new language to learn. Yeah. But I'm guessing not all of them are equally important for, say, our STEM audience. Which one would be the most useful, especially when dealing with right triangles? Ah, great question. For right triangles, Napier's rules are a lifesaver. Napier's rules, tell me more. So there are 10 of these rules, and they connect the different sides and angles of a right spherical triangle. The best part, you can remember them all using this cool mnemonic device called Napier's circle. A mnemonic device? Sounds intriguing. Right. So picture a circle that represents the right triangle. The sine of the middle part equals the product of the tangents of the adjacent parts, or the product of the cosines of the opposite parts. Okay, but how do we figure out which part is middle, adjacent, or opposite? Easy. Just look at the first vowel in the name. S in sine means middle, T in tangent means adjacent, and C in cosine means opposite. That's clever. I might actually be able to solve a right spherical triangle now. But what about the non-right angled ones? How do we solve those? Good question. Solving a spherical triangle basically means figuring out the missing sides or angles if we know some of the others. It's like a puzzle. Exactly. And like any good puzzle, it has different cases. Like you might know all three sides, which is the SSS case, or you might know two sides and the angle between them, the SAS case, and so on. So different cases, different approaches. Yep. You have to pick the right formula or method based on what you know. Like for SSS, you could use the cosine rule directly, or maybe the half angle formulas if you want a more stable calculation. Got it. It's all about choosing the right tool for the job. Before we move on, can we talk a bit more about spherical excess? I feel like that's a really important concept that sets spherical trigonometry apart from the flat stuff. Absolutely. Spherical excess is key. So remember, the angles in a spherical triangle always add up to more than 180 degrees, unlike those flat triangles we're used to. Right. Because of the curvature. Exactly. And that difference, that extra bit, is the spherical excess. Now, there's a cool theorem called Girard's theorem, and it tells us that this excess is actually equal to the area of the triangle, at least if we're talking about a sphere with radius 1. So the bigger the triangle, the more excess it has, and the bigger its area. You got it. It's all tied to the curvature of the sphere. It's like the triangle is trying to lie flat, but the sphere forces its angles to open up, creating that excess. So even though it seems like a small detail, this spherical excess really changes how we think about triangles on a sphere. For sure. And it turns out to be super important in a bunch of fields like geodesy, where people need to make precise measurements on Earth's surface. It's amazing how this seemingly simple idea has such a big impact. So where do we go from here? Well, in our next segment, we're going to dive deeper into some of those real-world applications and see how these spherical trigonometry concepts are used in practice. Sounds like a plan. It'll be fun, I promise. We'll even uncover some hidden connections between spherical trigonometry and other areas of math that you might not expect. I'm intrigued. Looking forward to it. Me too. Stay tuned. Welcome back to our deep dive into spherical trigonometry. So last time we laid down the basics, talked about spherical polygons, the cosine and sine rules. Right. And those Napier's rules for right triangles, which were pretty cool. Oh yeah, and who could forget the spherical excess. But now let's shift gears a bit and see how all these concepts are actually used to solve real-world problems, you know, stuff that's relevant to folks in STEM fields. Yeah, let's get practical. So you mentioned solving spherical triangles earlier. What does that actually involve? Okay, so solving a spherical triangle basically means figuring out the missing pieces of the puzzle, right? Let's say, you know, some of the sides and angles. We need to find the rest. Exactly. It's like having a partially completed jigsaw puzzle and we use those formulas and identities we discussed to fill in the blanks. So it's all about using what we know to figure out what we don't. Yeah. I'm guessing there are different scenarios depending on what information we have to start with. Oh, absolutely. That's where the cases come in. Remember we talked about SSS, SAS, and all those combinations? Yeah, those were the different ways of knowing the sides and angles, right? Exactly. Each case requires a slightly different approach, a different strategy for solving the puzzle. For example, if we have all three sides, the SSS case, we could use the cosine rule directly to get the angles. Okay, makes sense. But are there other ways to tackle these cases? Oh, tons. Sometimes it's helpful to split the triangle into two right-angled triangles and use Napier's rules, or we can use something called the De Lombre analogies or Napier's analogies. Whoa, lots of options. Yeah, spherical trigonometry gives us a whole toolkit to play with, and the trick is knowing which tool is best for each situation. It's like being a chef who knows when to use a whisk versus a spatula. I like that analogy. So can you give us some real-world examples of where this all comes in handy? Like, how's spherical trigonometry used in navigation? Ah, navigation. That's a classic example. Imagine you're a ship captain and you need to find the shortest
