## Description

In this episode we explore Herbig-Haro objectsâ€”the glowing shock fronts produced when newborn stars launch fast jets into their surrounding gas. We trace their discovery, uncover how these jets form and interact with the interstellar medium, and learn what these dynamic features reveal about the early lives of stars â€” plus how amateur observers can catch changes on human timescales.

## Transcript

Have you ever looked at one of those gorgeous nebula pictures? You know, the giant clouds of cosmic dust and gas and stuff? Oh, yeah. Stunning. It just seems so peaceful, so calm, like not much is happening. Yeah, right? But man, those stellar nurseries, those are some crazy busy places. Oh, yeah. So much going on. Lots of energy, lots of drama. And that is what we are diving into today, right? Absolutely. Herbig-Haro objects? Herbig-Haro objects, that's right. They're like little cosmic spotlights, right? Shining a light on what's going on as stars are born. I like that, cosmic spotlights. Yeah. So imagine we could zoom in on one of these Herbig-Haro objects. Okay. What are we actually seeing? Well, at the core of it all is this super high-speed collision, right? So you've got these baby stars, they're still forming, and they shoot out these narrow jets of gas. But we're not talking just any gas. It's partially ionized, we call it plasma. And these jets, they're not just drifting along. We're talking hundreds of kilometers per second. Whoa. Yeah. That's serious speed. Yeah, and they slam into these slower-moving clouds of gas and dust, and bam, shockwaves, tons of heat, things start to glow. And that's what we see, right? That's it. That's your Herbig-Haro object. Amazing. And these are pretty common, right? Yeah. If you look at star-forming regions, you're going to find a bunch of these Herbig-Haro objects hanging around. They usually line up with the star's rotation, which is a big clue about how they're made. So it's like the star is already shaping its surroundings, even though it's just a baby. Exactly. But they don't last forever, do they? Oh, no, no, no, not at all. Like, how long are we talking? Astronomically speaking, not very long. A few tens of thousands of years, tops. But here's the cool thing. We can actually see them change over just a few years. Really? Yeah, they're moving away from their parent star, bumping into stuff, changing shape, the whole deal. That's pretty cool. So even amateur astronomers could see these things happening. Yeah, with the right equipment and some patience, definitely. So let's step back a bit. How are these cosmic spotlights first discovered? We've got to rewind all the way back to the late 1800s. There was this astronomer, Sherburn Wesley Burnham, and he was checking out this young star, T. tori. And near it, he spotted this little fuzzy patch, a nebula. At the time, they just thought it was another regular emission nebula. They even called it Burnham's Nebula. But T. tori itself, that's a really important star in this story. Right, T. tori is like the poster child for a whole class of young stars. You got it. These are stars that haven't settled down yet. They're still growing, still figuring things out. They haven't reached that stable point in their lives where they just kind of chill and burn their fuel. Right, right. They're still in that awkward teenage phase of star life. Okay, so now let's fast forward a bit to the 1940s. This is when we meet George Herbig and Guillermo Haro. Exactly. They were both working independently. Yep, both looking at the Orion Nebula. And they both started seeing these small nebulous things that kind of looked like stars. And Herbig, he made this key discovery. He looked at the light coming from these objects, their spectrum. Right. And it was weird. It had these really strong emission lines from hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. And those lines, they're like a signature. They tell us about the gas being hot and shocked. And then we have Haro. He finds another important piece of the puzzle. Yes. He noticed that these objects, they were really faint or even invisible when you looked at them in infrared light. That's right. And that was huge because most nebulas, they glow brightly in infrared because of all the dust they have. So this is a big clue that these were something different, right? Exactly. So eventually, Herbig and Haro, they meet up. Yeah. At a conference in 1949, they started comparing notes and things clicked. And then this Soviet astronomer, Viktor Barsumian, he comes in and points out that these objects are always hanging around very young stars. Like really young, only a few hundred thousand years old. And he proposes that these Herbig-Haro objects, that's what he called them, are like a stage in the development of those T-Tori stars. So basically, these objects are showing us what happens in the early life of a star. That's amazing. Right. So at first, they thought these might be reflection nebulae. Yeah. The idea was maybe there's a dim, hot star hiding inside, and the light from that star is bouncing off the surrounding gas and dust. Hmm. But that wouldn't explain the lack of infrared light, right? Exactly. So what was the next idea? Well, they started thinking about stellar winds, those streams of particles that stars blow off. In 1975, Artie Schwartz, he said that the winds from these young stars, they could be the culprit. He thought that when these winds slam into the surrounding interstellar medium, all that gas and dust just sitting out there, it would create shock waves, which could heat up the gas and make it glow. Hmm. So basically, those shock waves would create the Herbig-Haro objects. Exactly. But was there any direct evidence for this? Well, then came the clincher, the smoking gun. Astronomers saw the first protostellar jet, a jet coming from a protostar, from this object called HH4647. Hmm. That was the proof they needed. It showed that these Herbig-Haro objects, they're really formed by jets. Hmm. Jets shooting out from baby stars. Okay, so we've talked about the history, how they were discovered. Right. Now let's get into how these jets and Herbig-Haro objects actually form. Okay. It all starts with, you know, the birth of a star. Yeah, absolutely. So you've got these giant clouds of gas and dust. Huge, cold, and mostly hydrogen and helium. And gravity starts to pull everything together. Yeah, it's like a cosmic dust bunny. It just keeps getting bigger and denser in the center. And eventually you get a protostar. Exactly. But all that stuff falling in, it starts to spin. Right, like a figure skater pulling their arms in. They spin faster, and the same thing happens with the cloud. So you get this rotating disk of gas and dust around the protostar. Yeah, it's called an accretion disk. And it's from this disk that those jets are launched. So not all of the stuff falls onto the protostar? Nope, some of it gets shot back out, like the protostar saying, hey, I'm full. And these jets, they go out along the protostar's rotational axis in two opposite directions. So you get these twin beams of plasma. Yeah, like HH34, it's a great example. But we don't fully understand how these jets are launched, do we? Well, we have a pretty good idea. We think it has to do with the interplay between the accretion disk and the protostar's magnetic field. It's complicated, but basically the magnetic field can act like a slingshot. It accelerates some of the material and focuses it into those jets. And these jets, they're not perfectly focused right away, are they? No, not at first. Close to the star, they might spread out a bit, like 10 to 30 degrees. But as they travel farther away, they become more collimated, like they narrow down into tighter beams. So something is focusing them as they move out. Right, and exactly how that happens is still something we're studying. So these jets, they're not just a pretty light show, right? No, not at all. They have a really important job. They help the protostar get rid of excess angular momentum. Angular momentum, that's like the tendency to keep spinning, right? Yeah, like a spinning top. As the protostar sucks in more stuff, its angular momentum goes up and it would just spin faster and faster. But if it spins too fast, it could become unstable, even break apart. So the jets act like a brake. They carry away some of that rotational energy. Exactly, and that helps the star form properly. So the Herbig-Haro objects we see, they're like the cosmic exhaust fumes from these stellar engines. That's a great way to put it. They're the visible evidence of those jets plowing into the surrounding material. Okay, so we have these jets, they're colliding with the interstellar medium. What are the properties of the resulting Herbig-Haro objects? Well, most of the light we see comes from shockwaves. It's like when a supersonic jet breaks the sound barrier, you get a sonic boom. Same idea here, but with gas instead of sound. When that jet slams into the surrounding gas and dust, it creates a shock front. And that heats up the gas, like a lot, thousands of degrees. It gets ionized, meaning the atoms lose some of their electrons, and that makes it glow. And we see that glow as a Herbig-Haro object. So the light from these objects, it tells us a lot. Absolutely, we can analyze the spectrum of the light, and that tells us what elements are present. You know, hydrogen, helium, oxygen, stuff like that. And it also
