## Description

Join us on The Deep Dive as we unpack Availability to Promise (ATP): what it is, why it matters, and how it anchors order promising and fulfillment. We break down push vs. pull ATP, gross vs. net ATP, and real-time versus batch execution. Weâ€™ll explore how ERP/SCM systems calculate ATP, balance stockouts against excess inventory, and navigate omnichannel demand. Practical insights for supply chain pros on using ATP to align market demand with available supply and keep promises without tying up capital.

## Transcript

Welcome back everyone to the deep dive. You know, today we're going to get into something that I think is pretty fundamental when it comes to managing a modern supply chain and that's available to promise. ATP. ATP. There we go. I was going to say or ATP. So this is, I think about it as this is your system's way of sort of like looking at a customer's order request and saying, okay, yep, we can do this and here's when you can expect it, you know, that kind of thing. Yeah, that's it. Like at the most basic level, ATP is about giving you a reliable answer to a very, very fundamental question and that is, can we actually meet this demand? And if so, when can we deliver? And it really is sort of the underpinning of the entire order promising and fulfillment process. It's the link between what your customer wants and what you're actually able to do. Yeah, so it's like the brains of the operation in a way. It's like helping us align what the market is looking for with what we can actually produce, right? So, I mean, we've got some really cool stuff to unpack here. We've gathered some great insights that I think are really going to help all of you out there who are, you know, supply chain professionals really thinking about how to leverage ATP to really effectively manage the supply you've got, given all these orders that are coming in, right? We're going to explore different, I guess you could say, flavors of ATP and what each of those choices means for you on a day-to-day basis. Absolutely. And, you know, I think it's probably for a lot of our listeners, you know, folks in the trenches, probably second nature to them that, you know, this isn't something you're just doing on a spreadsheet anymore, right? Right. ATP is often like deeply embedded within, you know, your enterprise resource planning or other supply chain management software. So really it's like the digital backbone that's connecting everything. That's making all the magic happen behind the scenes. That's right. Right. Okay, so, I mean, let's kind of, you know, let's unpack some of the core mechanics here, right? When we're looking at our sources, it seems like there's sort of a fork in the road right off the bat when it comes to ATP. You know, you can go down the push-based path or you can go down the pull-based path and maybe you can illuminate the difference for us. Yeah, absolutely. So when we talk about push-based ATP, this is really about looking forward, right? It really leans heavily on, you know, demand forecasting, trying to anticipate what customers are going to want in the future, and then based on those projections, the system's proactively calculating, you know, how much is going to be available and when. So it's like the system is saying, okay, based on what we think is going to happen in the future, this is how much we think we're going to have. Right, exactly. But of course, there's always the risk of, you know, how accurate is that prediction, right? How good is our crystal ball? Exactly. And that's, I mean, you hit the nail on the head there. That's one of the, you know, the key limitations of push-based ATP. Right. It's only as good as the forecast that it's based on. You know, and our sources also make a really important distinction here between what they call gross ATP and net ATP, right? Okay. So gross ATP is really about the total supply that you anticipate having. So that's everything, right? Whereas net ATP is really what's left over after you've already committed some of your stock to customer orders that you know are coming down the pipeline. So I guess, like, gross is the total potential and net is what you can actually really promise. That's a great way to put it. Right. Okay. So, you know, push-based is all about looking forward. Maybe you can tell us how pull-based kind of flips the script. Yeah, yeah. So pull-based is much more reactive, right? So rather than trying to anticipate demand ahead of time, it's about dynamically allocating your resources in response to actual orders as they come in. So as the orders are coming in the door, you're making those calls. Exactly. So the system is constantly balancing, you know, the need to replenish its inventory, which to be fair might still involve some kind of forecasting, especially for things that have longer lead times, with this immediate, you know, need to use up those resources as each new order rolls in. Okay. So, I mean, is there a potential downside to this? Like, if it's so just in time, is there a chance that it kind of misses the bigger picture? Yeah, there is. And, you know, it's interesting. One of the things our sources highlight is this risk of what they call myopic results. Okay. And the idea here is that because you're allocating resources on a first-come, first-served basis, as each individual order comes in, you might not actually be optimizing for, you know, larger demand that might be coming down the line or just for overall inventory efficiency. Right. It's kind of like short-sighted in a way. In a way, yeah. It's very much focused on the here and now. Yeah. Very interesting. So we've got push-based, which is kind of like, you know, planning ahead, but maybe, you know, that plan could be wrong. And then we've got pull-based, which is very responsive, but maybe is a little bit short-sighted. So I'm kind of curious, like, how does this actually work in practice? How is this actually executed? Yeah. Yeah. So when we talk about ATP execution, it really falls into two main buckets. The first is what we call real-time execution. So the idea here is as soon as a customer places an order, the system's instantly checking. Do we have the stuff? Right. You know, looking at, you know, inventory levels, whether it's finished goods or raw materials, whatever it might be, right? Exactly. And then the other one is what we call batch mode. And the idea here is that the system is kind of periodically, you know, maybe every hour, maybe at the end of the day, it's taking a look at all the new orders that have come in since the last time it checked. So like a snapshot. Yeah, it's like a periodic inventory snapshot. And then it's saying, okay, based on all these orders, can we do it? Gotcha. Okay. So in the real trigger, the reason this whole process kicks off is because we want to be sure that we can actually fulfill this customer's order before we make any promises, right? Yeah, absolutely. You want to be able to say yes and actually mean it. Deliver on that promise. Exactly. And it's interesting, you know, our sources even give a concrete example here. They talk about how, you know, in an SAP system, when you're doing that ATP calculation, you're taking into account a whole bunch of different factors. You're looking at stock levels. You're looking at planned receipts. So, you know, are there any production orders that are going to be finished soon? Are there any purchase orders, any planned orders? Things coming in. Things coming in. And then you're also looking at, you know, planned requirements, sales orders, deliveries that are already sort of underway, any reserved stock. Okay, so it's a pretty complex calculation. It can be, yeah. It's not just counting boxes on the shelf. Exactly. So, you know, one of the things that I think keeps every supply chain professional up at night is this question of, you know, how much inventory do I need to have? It's like that constant balancing act. And on the one hand, you don't want to run out of stuff. Right. And on the other hand, you don't want to have too much inventory sitting around. So how does ATP help us navigate that tricky situation? Yeah, it's such a key part of that. You know, I think as the sources point out, especially if you're in a business that deals directly with customers, avoiding stockouts is like job number one. Right, because if you run out of product, I mean, that's lost sales. Lost sales. That's customers who are disappointed who might go somewhere else. And they might never come back. Yeah, and then they might tell all their friends about it too. You know, they might leave nasty reviews online. You know, there's a real damage to the brand, to the reputation. Yeah. I think we've all had that experience of, you know, shopping online and seeing that dreaded, oh, this item is currently unavailable. Yeah, or backordered six months, you know. Exactly. Right, exactly. But the flip side of that, you know, having too much inventory, that's a whole other set of risks. Sure, it costs money to store all that stuff. It does, yeah. You're tying up all this working capital. You got warehousing costs, handling costs, and then there's always the risk of, you know, the stuff becoming obsolete or, you know, if you're dealing with perishable goods. Yeah, or, you know, fashion, something that's seasonal, like, you know, retailers have to, you know, they put those big markdowns. Exactly, exactly. So, you know, the real trick is to find that sweet spot, right? Especially in today's world, where you've got all these different sales channels, omni-channel, and, you know, all that. How do you keep your inventory levels lean so that you're not spending a fortune, but also making sure you have enough to meet that demand, which can fluctuate so wildly, without running into those stockouts or ending up with a warehouse full of stuff that you can't sell? Right, so it's all about finding that balance
