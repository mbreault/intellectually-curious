## Transcript

Okay, so you want to learn about radium. We're talking about an element that went from like miracle cure to deadly danger. And honestly, what you sent us about it is fascinating. Yeah, it really is. We're going to dive deep into radium. Absolutely. Using what you shared, excerpts from the Wikipedia article on radium and this really interesting Stanford report article. Yeah. Focusing on the history of radium. It's really remarkable how much our understanding of this element has changed over time. Get ready for some surprises because you might be shocked to learn just how common radium used to be. Oh, yeah. We're talking everyday items kind of common. To get us started, how about we go all the way back to the discovery of radium? Sounds good to me. Imagine it's 1898 and we're in Paris with Marie and Pierre Curie working in their lab. Okay. They're fascinated by this new discovery, invisible radiation coming from uranium. Right. Which Henri Becquerel discovered. Marie Curie decides to focus her doctoral research on this. She was working with pitch blend, which is a uranium ore, right? That's right. And she was getting some strange readings. That's right. Her instruments were showing way higher radiation levels than could be explained by the uranium alone. Wow. That led her to believe that something else, another element that was even more radioactive, was hiding within the pitch blend. Her instincts were spot on. They spent years isolating radium, processing tons of pitch blend just to extract a tiny amount. It's incredible. What dedication. It's really hard to grasp what a massive undertaking that must have been. It really shows their incredible dedication to scientific exploration. Yeah. Marie Curie even coined the term radioactivity to describe the emissions she was observing. So once they finally isolated radium, what did they find out about it? Where does it fit in with the rest of the elements? Well, radium is an alkaline earth metal. And it's the heaviest one. It's the only radioactive element in that group. And sits right below barium on the periodic table. It shares a lot of properties with barium. And it's silvery white in its pure form. But there's a fun fact from the Stanford report that says it reacts with nitrogen in the air and turns black. Yeah, that black layer is actually radium nitride forming. Interesting. Another interesting thing is that every single radium isotope is radioactive. Meaning their atoms are unstable and break down over time. Right. That's where the danger comes in. Makes sense. And unfortunately, that danger wasn't immediately understood. To help us understand this danger, could you tell us a little more about these isotopes? Absolutely. Let's talk about radium-226. Okay. This is the most stable isotope with a half-life of 1,600 years. Wow. That means it takes 1,600 years for half of a sample of radium-226 to break down into other elements. Okay. It's what makes up almost all naturally occurring radium. So because of that long half-life, its radioactivity lasts for an incredibly long time. Yes. What happens when it decays? It goes through a series of steps, emitting different types of energy along the way. Okay. These are called alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. One of the byproducts is radon gas, which is also radioactive and a major contributor to radium's danger. So at this point, scientists are discovering radium and learning about these radioactive properties. Yes. But according to what you sent us, radium was viewed in a surprisingly positive light back in the early 1900s. Yes, that's right. There was a period known as the radium craze. Okay. People were captivated by radium's glow-in-the-dark properties, and the idea of this newfound energy was very appealing. It was marketed as a health booster and added to everything. Toothpaste, chocolate, even water. There were even radium spas where people would soak in radium-rich water. It's crazy to think about now. It's wild to think about now. What's fascinating here is how radium's properties were both misunderstood and exploited. This was a time when new scientific discoveries captivated the public, and radium, with its glow-in-the-dark allure, became a symbol of progress. People associated it with vitality and good health, which is tragic because the dangers of radiation weren't fully understood. It really is incredible to think about how our understanding of things can change so drastically. It is. And I know radium was even used in medicine at that time, right? Yes, it was. Doctors were beginning to experiment with radium in early radiotherapy to try and target and destroy cancerous tumors. It was really a groundbreaking advancement in medicine, but definitely not without its drawbacks. This early use of radium to treat cancer, it seems revolutionary for the time. Yeah. But I imagine there were some significant challenges. What kind of setbacks or limitations did they encounter? At that time, doctors and scientists were working with a very powerful tool, but didn't have a full grasp of the long-term consequences. Right. While some patients did benefit from these early treatments, many others experienced serious side effects from the radiation exposure. The information you sent lists anemia, cancer, and even genetic mutations as potential consequences of radium exposure. Exactly. The potential benefits of radium in medicine were intertwined with very real dangers, and that line was very blurry at the time. Sounds like it. This brings up an important point, finding the balance between scientific advancement and protecting people. Yeah. While radium offered hope for treating diseases like cancer, the long-term effects could be absolutely devastating. It's a good point, and it makes the story of the radium girls all the more tragic. Absolutely. What they went through is really difficult to grasp, especially knowing they were exposed to such danger without being aware of the risks. It's a story that exemplifies the human cost of scientific progress and serves as a stark reminder of the importance of worker safety. These women were working in factories, painting watch dials with radium paint to make them glow in the dark. Right. I remember reading about this in the Stanford report. Yeah. The paint was a mixture of radium and zinc sulfide. That's right. The radium emitted alpha particles that would cause the zinc sulfide to glow. And tragically, the women were told to lick their brushes to get a fine point. Oh, wow. Which was standard practice at the time for that kind of delicate work. It's just horrifying. They were ingesting radium with every lick. It's unbelievable. Hundreds of times every day, and they had absolutely no idea how dangerous it was. The Stanford report article you sent estimates they were ingesting up to 43 micrograms of radium daily. Wow. That constant exposure led to horrific health problems for these women. Both the Wikipedia article and the Stanford report detail the horrible consequences. Oh. Jaw necrosis. Right. Tooth loss. Ulcers that refuse to heal. Bone fractures. Anemia. And in many cases, aggressive forms of cancer. Their bodies were ravaged by the radiation. And it took years for the companies to acknowledge the danger. It's terrible. And even longer for the women to get any justice. The impact of their fight was significant. Oh, for sure. It wasn't just about the suffering they endured. Their legal battles were landmark cases that established workers' compensation and paved the way for the occupational safety regulations we have today. That's right. Every worker today benefits from that legacy. Absolutely. It was a turning point that forced people to confront the issue of worker safety and acknowledge the need for rigorous scientific testing and transparency, especially when using new technologies. So the Radium Girl story had a major role in bringing the dangers of radium to light. For sure. But going back to the radium craze, it's almost unbelievable that people were so eager to use a substance that's now known to be so dangerous. Looking back, it's easy to judge. Right. But it's important to remember the historical context. Yeah. In the early 20th century, radioactivity was a completely new discovery. It was seen as this mysterious force. Like magic. Almost like magic. That's right. And this discovery came about during a time when society was really fascinated by science and technology. People were excited about anything that promised to improve health and well-being and bring about progress. It's really amazing how something like that can sweep the world. It is. Looking at what you shared with us, there were radium-infused products everywhere. Everywhere. Radium water, radium toothpaste, radium face cream, even radium chocolate. It's hard to believe now, knowing what we know. There were radium spas where people would soak in radium-rich water, thinking it was a fountain of youth. Oh, wow. The luminescence of radium? Yeah. Eerie glow-in-the-dark quality actually made it more appealing. It must have seemed almost supernatural. Oh, yeah. It's a powerful example of what can happen when a lack of scientific understanding is combined with clever marketing. Yeah. People were drawn to the allure of radium without knowing the potential consequences. Yes, and that's an important lesson even today. Yeah. We see similar patterns with fad diets, miracle cures, and certain wellness trends. It's a reminder to be cautious, to learn from the past, and not just jump on board with something new without looking into it. Absolutely. So with all the negative consequences coming to light, how did the radium craze eventually end? As we discussed, the tragic story of the radium girls played a major role. Their suffering and the lawsuits that followed brought the dangers of radium into the public eye, and it was no longer possible to ignore those devastating health consequences. There's a detail in the Wikipedia article that I found really disturbing. It mentions that the scientists and managers at these radium companies were taking precautions to protect themselves from radiation. Yes,
