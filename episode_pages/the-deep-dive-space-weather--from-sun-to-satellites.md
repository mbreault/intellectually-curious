## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive. Today, we're diving into the world of space weather. It's a topic that's especially relevant for STEM students like you. We've got historical accounts, scientific research, and even some real-world examples of how space weather impacts us here on Earth. It's definitely a field that can be easy to overlook, but it really does have the potential to disrupt our technology and even our daily lives. Yeah, it's like we forget that we're living in a dynamic and active solar system. So, first things first, what exactly is space weather? Well, space weather is the term for the changing conditions in space driven by the sun. Think of it like regular weather patterns, but instead of rain and wind, it's charged particles, radiation, and magnetic fields. So, like the solar system's version of weather. I've heard that people have been observing the effects of space weather for centuries without really knowing what it was. That's true. You know the auroras, those beautiful lights in the sky? They've been observed for a long time, but we only figured out recently that they are caused by charged particles from the sun interacting with the Earth's atmosphere. Wow, so even ancient civilizations were seeing the power of space weather. It makes you wonder what other phenomena we see today that might have a connection to the sun. Are there any other early observations that stand out? There's an interesting one. In 1724, a scientist, George Graham, observed that compass needles would deflect at regular intervals. And we now know this was caused by electric currents in the atmosphere, driven by, you guessed it, solar activity. So, space weather was messing with our navigation way back then. How did our understanding of space weather change as we entered the space age? Well, the launch of Sputnik in 1957 really marked a turning point. As we started sending things into space, like satellites and eventually people, we realized how vulnerable our technology was to space. Right, satellites are so important for communication and navigation. They must be pretty susceptible to space weather. Oh, definitely. The radiation from solar events can damage parts of satellites, shorten their lifespan, and in extreme cases, even knock them out of orbit. That's a scary thought considering how much we rely on satellites. It is. And it's not just satellites at risk. The effects of space weather can cascade down to Earth too, affecting everything from power grids to airline routes. That actually leads into my next question. How does space weather impact us down here on Earth? Well, one common effect is on GPS signals. Space weather can disrupt radio waves traveling through the atmosphere, especially at higher latitudes. This affects the accuracy of GPS. You might have even noticed this yourself if your GPS is ever messed up. Actually, yeah. Come to think of it, I have. I never would have guessed that was space weather. What are some other ways it can affect technology? You see, major space weather events, like intense geomagnetic storms, can induce powerful electric currents in the ground. And these currents can overload power grids, which leads to blackouts. Imagine a whole city going dark because of a solar storm. That's a little unsettling. It's not like even flying isn't safe from space weather. You're right. Flights, especially over the poles, are exposed to higher radiation levels during space weather events. Airlines and pilots need to be really aware of this, especially when solar activity is high. So space weather isn't just a scientific thing. It can really disrupt our lives. To understand these risks, we need to know how to track these events. What do scientists use to keep an eye on the sun? We have a network of observatories, both on the ground and in space. They monitor the sun's activity. It's similar to having weather stations, but we're looking at things like solar flares and coronal mass ejections. It's like a space weather forecasting system. What are some examples of these observatories, and what kind of data do they collect? Well, one important tool is the ground-based magnetometer. It measures changes in Earth's magnetic field, which can be a sign of a solar storm brewing. So it's kind of like a seismograph, but for space weather. What about space-based observatories? There's the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, or SOHO. It's been giving us amazing images of the sun for decades. It can observe things like the sun's corona and its surface where sunspots form. Sunspots. Those are the darker patches on the sun, right? Yeah. What are they exactly? They are cooler regions on the sun's surface, and they are usually associated with intense magnetic activity. By tracking sunspots, we can get a sense of when and where things like solar flares might occur. It's like having a map of the sun's hot spots. I'm guessing there are other space-based observatories that help us get a more complete picture. For sure. In 2006, NASA launched the STEREO mission. It has two spacecraft, one ahead of Earth in its orbit and one behind. This gives scientists a 3D view so they can track coronal mass ejections as they travel through space. So we have S for constant monitoring and stereo for tracking those coronal mass ejections. Are there other important observatories? We also have the GOES series of satellites. They provide us with real-time data on the space environment around Earth. Real-time data. That must be super helpful for forecasting. What kind of instruments do they have? GOES satellites have all sorts of instruments, including X-ray sensors to detect solar flares, magnetometers to measure changes in Earth's magnetic field, and particle detectors to monitor the particles coming from the sun. It sounds like we have a pretty impressive network for observing space weather. But how do scientists use all this data to actually predict space weather events? That's where space weather models come in. Just like we use models to predict weather on Earth, we have models for space weather too. So it's like creating a digital twin of these space environments. Exactly. These models use equations to describe the physical processes that drive space weather. I bet it takes a lot of computing power and a deep understanding of physics to make those models. Definitely. The field is constantly evolving as we get more data from our observatories. This has been a great overview of the basics of space weather. We've covered a lot of ground already. Yeah, there's definitely a lot more to explore. Welcome back to The Deep Dive. Now, let's take a closer look at some of the specific phenomena that scientists are tracking. Okay, so we know the sun's activity is the main driver of space weather. But what exactly are we talking about? What are some of these events that can affect us here on Earth? Well, one of the key players is the solar wind. It's a constant stream of charged particles flowing from the sun. You can think of it like a river constantly carrying its magnetic field with it. So not just heat and light coming from the sun, but also this stream of charged particles. Exactly. And while it's always there, the solar wind's intensity can change. When it increases, we start to see more noticeable effects here on Earth. Right, so a stronger solar wind means more charged particles hitting Earth's magnetic field. What happens then? Well, when the sun's magnetic field interacts with Earth's magnetic field, it can cause what we call geomagnetic storms. These storms can cause all sorts of problems, like messing with radio communications, GPS signals, and even those power outages we talked about. It's like a cosmic battle of magnetic fields. You mentioned satellites being especially vulnerable to these storms. They are. During a geomagnetic storm, the energy from the sun makes the Earth's atmosphere heat up and expand. This can change the orbits of satellites, sometimes causing them to collide or even fall back to Earth. So designing satellites isn't just about dealing with radiation. You also have to think about these geomagnetic storms. Absolutely. Satellite engineers have to keep all of that in mind and build in protection to make sure they can withstand these events. Are there any other space weather events we should be aware of, besides the solar wind and geomagnetic storms? Oh, yeah. We also have solar flares. These are sudden bursts of energy from the sun's surface. They emit all kinds of radiation, like X-rays and gamma rays, which can reach Earth really quickly, in a matter of minutes. That sounds intense. What happens when all that radiation hits Earth? Is it dangerous to us? Fortunately, we have the Earth's atmosphere. It acts like a shield, absorbing most of that harmful radiation. But these flares can still disrupt radio communications, especially those used for long-distance communication. Like a temporary radio blackout from the sun. Can we actually see solar flares from Earth? Well, we can't see the X-rays and gamma rays directly. Sometimes solar flares are associated with bright flashes of light, but the main way we study them is with instruments on our space observatories. It's amazing how scientists can study those events happening so far away. So we've got solar wind, geomagnetic storms, and solar flares. Are there any other big space weather events we need to worry about? There's one more, and it's probably the most powerful one. Coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. Right, CMEs, those massive eruptions from the sun. Are they related to solar flares? They can occur together, but they are separate events. Think of a solar flare like a quick flash of energy and a CME as a giant cannon firing a massive cloud of solar material into space. So it's not just energy, but actual physical matter being thrown out from the sun. Wow, how fast do CMEs travel and what happens when they reach Earth? CMEs are much slower than light. They usually take a few days to get here, but they carry a lot of energy. When a CME hits Earth's magnetic field, it can trigger the strongest geomagnetic storms. So CMEs are like the heavy hitters of space
