## Description

Science Corner dives into what 'instinct' really means, unpacking fixed action patterns, releasers, and the surprising ways instinct shapes behaviorâ€”from gray lag geese to brood parasitism. We explore how these inborn sequences can be rigid yet adaptive, and how tricks like supernormal stimuli reveal their vulnerabilities. Then we turn to humans: do we have instincts at all? We discuss the infant studies and cross-species comparisons scientists use to separate innate from learned behavior, and what play across species can tell us about biologyâ€™s imprint on behavior.

## Transcript

Welcome back to Science Corner, everybody. I am so excited for our deep dive today. We're going to be tackling a concept that seems pretty simple on the surface, but gets really fascinating the deeper you go. We're talking about instinct. Always a fun one. We've got a couple of Wikipedia articles to guide us, one on instinct itself and then another on something called fixed action patterns, which we'll definitely have to unpack. And we've also got a really interesting article on the history and criticisms of something called instinct theory. Yeah, you might be surprised how much debate there actually is around what seems like a pretty basic biological idea. Well, let's see if we can shed some light on all of that debate then. Where would you even begin with defining instinct? Because I feel like we use that word all the time, but maybe not always in a super precise way. I think that's right. We do kind of throw the word instinct around pretty casually. Scientifically speaking, I think the simplest way to define instinct is as an inherent inclination toward a complex behavior. So it's not something that's learned. It's really driven by those inborn biological factors. So it's more than just like a simple reflex. Right. Like way more complex. A reflex is something super simple, like your knee jerking when the doctor taps it. But instincts, those involve a whole sequence of actions. And often they can be incredibly elaborate and complex. Okay, so I'm already thinking about like, you know, those nature documentaries. You see those sea turtle hatchlings and they scramble towards the ocean. They've never seen the ocean before, but they just know, right? Right. That is a classic example of instinct and a very vivid one too. It really highlights how vital these inborn behaviors can be for survival. Oh, for sure. Those little turtles need to get to the water or they're not going to make it. So it's like pre-programmed in a way to make sure they do the right thing from the get-go. And it makes you wonder how that information gets passed down. It really does. Now, you mentioned how instincts can be really complex. And that makes me think about these fixed action patterns that I saw in one of our sources. What exactly are those? Right. Fixed action patterns or FAPs for short. It's essentially how we observe instincts actually playing out, especially in the animal world. Think of them as a sequence of behaviors, but they're very specific and predictable. Like each step leads to the next in a very particular order. Kind of like a chain reaction almost. Precisely. And for a behavior to actually qualify as a true FAP, it has to meet some pretty strict criteria. So first, it has to be stereotyped. Stereotyped, meaning it always happens in the same way. Exactly the same way every time. It has to be complex too, more than just a single reflex. And it has to be specific to that particular species. You don't see the same FAPs across all different kinds of animals. So that's the fixed part, I guess. But what triggers these patterns in the first place? How does an animal know when to start that whole chain reaction? That is where the releaser comes in. And it's a crucial part of the whole thing. The releaser is a specific feature that triggers the FAP. It might be a shape, a color, a sound, some kind of sensory cue that acts as the signal to get things going. So it's like a specific key that fits into a specific lock. Perfect analogy. And the classic example here is the gray lag goose and its egg retrieval behavior. So if the goose sees an egg outside the nest, that visual cue is the releaser. So it sees the egg and that's what sets the whole thing off. Yep. And then the goose goes through this whole very specific sequence. It fixates on that egg, extends its neck, and then uses its beak to roll it back into the nest. It just knows to do that. Well, it's not really conscious knowing in the way we think about it. But here's where it gets even more interesting and even more fixed, I guess. Even if you take the egg away while the goose is in the middle of rolling it back, it will continue those motions as if the egg was still there. Wow. So it really is fixed, like it can't stop itself once that releaser starts the process. Yeah. That is amazing. And it makes you wonder what's going on in that goose brain when that happens. It really does, doesn't it? It's like a program that has to run its course. And I think that brings us to another crucial point about releasers, and it kind of gets at the why behind all of this. The releaser is often tied to the animal's survival. It's not just any random thing. It's something that signals something really important. So those FAPs, they might seem rigid, but they're actually incredibly sophisticated adaptations that help animals survive, right? Exactly. And I think the more we look at these examples, the more we start to appreciate how much complexity is packed into these seemingly simple behaviors. Absolutely. And it's amazing how specific those releasers can be and how they can really, you know, dictate behavior. A great example of this is the male stickleback fish. During mating season, they develop this really bright red belly. Oh yeah, I've seen pictures of those. They're pretty striking. And that red belly becomes the releaser for aggression in other males. So they'll attack anything that has a red belly, even if it's just a crude model, as long as the red is like more intense than their own. Wait, so they would actually be more riled up by a fake fish than a real rival? That seems kind of counterintuitive, doesn't it? It does, but it actually illustrates this really cool concept called supernormal stimuli. And it's basically an exaggerated version of the natural releaser, and it ends up triggering an even stronger response. Remember that gray lag goose we talked about with the egg? If you were to give it a volleyball next to its real egg, it might actually choose to roll back the volleyball because it's just so much bigger. Oh wow. So we can kind of trick an animal's instincts by manipulating those releasers. That's fascinating and kind of unsettling at the same time. It really is. It makes you wonder about all the ways that those instincts can be manipulated, both in nature and, you know, maybe even in ourselves. And there's one example in nature that's especially striking, and that's brood parasitism. And the cuckoo bird is like the poster child for this. The cuckoo? I know they've got a bit of a sneaky reputation when it comes to eggs. Oh yeah, sneaky is putting it lightly. They've basically perfected the art of exploiting other birds' instincts. So the female cuckoo, she'll lay her eggs in the nests of other birds, and then she just relies on those foster parents' instincts to take care of any eggs that are in their nest. So they just see the eggs and boom, the parenting instinct kicks in, even if it's not their own kid. Exactly. They respond to that releaser of having eggs in the nest, and the cuckoo basically gets a free ride. Her offspring gets raised by somebody else. Talk about a clever evolutionary strategy, although maybe a little bit ruthless, too. But it does make me wonder about us, you know, humans. Where do we fit into all of this instinct stuff? Do we even have instincts? Ooh, that is the million-dollar question, isn't it? And it's a question that's generated a ton of debate over the years. There are some scientists who argue that humans don't really have instincts at all. Others say, of course we do. But it can be really tricky to define what we mean by instinct in humans. Yeah, I can see how that would be a big debate. There's so much variation in human behavior. What might look like instinct in one culture could just be something that's learned in another. Right, exactly. So how do you tease those two things apart, the innate versus the learned? It's a real challenge. One thing researchers do is they look at infants. You know, observing babies from a very early age can help pinpoint those behaviors that seem to be present basically right from birth. So like we were talking about with the sea turtles, but with human babies. Yeah, exactly. And if it's there from the very beginning, it hints that there might be this biological basis. So what kinds of things are they looking at in those little babies? Well, things like facial expressions, for instance. Research suggests that babies can display those basic emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, even babies who were born blind. So it's like they have this sort of innate emotional vocabulary. That is wild. Yeah. But how do you know for sure that they're not, you know, somehow picking up on subtle cues from their environment, even without sight? It's a good question. And it's definitely tricky. But it makes you think, right? Another thing researchers do is compare human behavior to what we see in other animals, especially our primate cousins. Right, because if we see similar behaviors across species, that hints that there might be some deeper evolutionary root. Exactly. It suggests that maybe there is this biological basis for that behavior. So like common threads across the animal kingdom, what kinds of things have they found to be similar between us and, say, chimps or gorillas? One really interesting example is play behavior. Young animals across a bunch of species, and that includes us, right? Human children engage in play that they don't seem to have like an immediate survival purpose. Like it's not about finding food or avoiding danger. It's just about like having fun, right? Right. But the thing is, it's remarkably similar across species, which suggests that there might actually be a biological function for play. That's so cool. So maybe those endless hours my niece
