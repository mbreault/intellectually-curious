## Description

A deep dive into the method of exhaustion, the ancient Greek technique of finding areas and volumes by squeezing shapes with inscribed and circumscribed polygons. We trace its origins with Antiphon and Bryson, see how Eudoxus formalized it through the theory of proportion, and follow the line from these ideas to modern calculusâ€”through limits, convergence, and rigorous reductio arguments.

## Transcript

Ever wonder how ancient mathematicians, you know folks centuries before calculus was even a concept, figured out areas of tricky curved shapes or volumes of complex objects? It's a fascinating question, isn't it? They had this incredibly clever technique. Exactly. Today we're doing a deep dive into something called the method of exhaustion. It's this logical approach the classical Greeks developed. And it's really in many ways the conceptual bedrock for calculus. Our aim here is to unpack the core idea, see how it developed. And trace that surprising line right up to modern calculus, right? Precisely. We want to understand the ingenuity behind it, especially since they lacked our modern algebraic tools. Their level of rigor was groundbreaking. Okay, so for this deep dive we're looking at various historical descriptions, insights from math history texts, and particularly the work of Eudoxus of Cytius, who seems like a key player. A major figure, absolutely. So let's get into it. The essence of the method of exhaustion. It's actually quite simple at its heart. Simple how? You take a complex shape, say something with a curve, and you approximate it using simpler known shapes. Usually polygons. Okay, like fitting squares or triangles inside. Exactly. And the key is, you use a sequence of these polygons. Think more and more sides. Ah, so you start maybe with a square inside a circle, then maybe an octagon, then a 16-sided figure. Precisely. And as you add more sides, these inscribed polygons fill up more and more of the circle. Their properties, like their area, get closer and closer to the circle's properties. There's a picture like that, figure one, in A Brief History, showing polygons just increasingly hugging the inside of the circle. Right, the idea is convergence. The area of the polygon converges to the area of the circle. It's like they exhaust the space between the polygon and the curve. That term exhaust really fits. I read that Antiphon of Athens way back noticed something like this. Yes, Antiphon had this observation. He saw that an inscribed square covers more than half the circle's area. Then an octagon covers more than three quarters. And if you keep doubling the sides, a regular polygon with, say, two decaly sides, covers more than one dollar of the area. Wow, so you can see how that gap gets smaller and smaller very systematically. It really does. But to make these arguments stick, mathematically speaking, they needed a rigorous proof method. And that often involves something called, was it, double reductio ad absurdum? Sounds intense. It does sound a bit daunting, but the logic is quite powerful. It's based on a very fundamental principle, the law of trichotomy. Trichotomy, meaning three parts. Exactly. For any two comparable quantities, let's call them A and B, only one of three things can be true. Either A is less than B, A equals B, or A is greater than B. That's it. Makes sense. One of those has to be true. So to prove that A actually equals B, they used an indirect approach. First they'd assume A is less than B. Okay, assume A, B. And then, through logical steps based on their geometry, they'd show that this assumption leads to some kind of impossibility, a contradiction. So if assuming A, B leads to nonsense, you know, A can't be less than B. Got it. But they weren't done. Then they'd make the other assumption. Assume A is greater than B. Assume A, B, and I bet that leads to a contradiction too. That's the goal. Show that A, B also results in a logical impossibility. So if A can't be less than B, and A can't be greater than B... The A only possibility left standing, the only logical conclusion, is that A must be equal to B. Huh. It's like boxing the truth in by eliminating the alternatives. Very clever. Extremely clever. And this method, the method of exhaustion, it didn't just appear fully formed, it evolved. Right. You mentioned key figures, Antiphon started it. Antiphon of Athens, around the 5th century BCE, yes. He's really credited with that initial crucial idea. Let's use inscribed polygons to figure out a circle's area. The historian Heath apparently said Antiphon deserved an honorable place for originating the idea. And rightly so. He was a fundamental conceptual lead. Then came Bryson of Heracleia. Okay, what did Bryson add? Bryson took it further. He thought, why only inscribed polygons? He's polygons outside the circle too, circumscribed ones. Oh, so squeezing the circle from both sides, inside and out. Exactly. He grasped that the circle's true area had to be sandwiched between the area of the inner polygon and the area of the outer polygon. That makes perfect sense. You've got a lower bound and an upper bound. And crucially, he understood that by increasing the number of sides on both polygons, you could make the difference between their areas, the gap the circle sits in, as tiny as you wanted. That feels very close to the modern idea of limits. It absolutely foreshadows it. Heath noted this connection to Archimedes' later, more famous work too. Okay, Antiphon, Bryson, and then the big name, Eudoxus. Eudoxus of Cynitas, yes. Around the 4th century BC. He seems to be the one who really transformed these ideas into a properly rigorous, formal mathematical technique. And he wasn't just a mathematician, was he? Sources say he was into astronomy, medicine, geography, a real polymath. Indeed. And it's likely his work in other fields, particularly his theory of proportion, was vital. Theory of proportion? How does that connect? Well, Greek mathematics had hit a snag with incommensurable quantities. Things like the diagonal of a square and its side, whose ratio isn't a simple fraction. Eudoxus developed a theory that could handle these irrational ratios rigorously. Ah, so being able to compare any two lengths, rational or irrational, was key. It was essential. And needing that kind of rigor for comparing magnitudes probably pushed him to formalize the method of exhaustion for areas and volumes too. And we find his work in Euclid's elements. A lot of it, yes. Particularly in book 12. That book starts using the method of exhaustion right away, with proposition 12.2. Okay, proposition 12.2, what does that state? It's a classic result. The areas of two circles are proportional to the squares of their diameters. So if you double the diameter, you quadruple the area. A fundamental property. And Eudoxus proved this using exhaustion. How? Did he need other tools? Yes, the proof rests on a few key principles already established, mostly within Euclid's system. You needed about four main things. All right, what's the first one? First, something called the axiom of comparability. You might also hear it called Eudoxus's axiom or the lemma of Archimedes. Okay, what's the gist? It basically says that if you have two quantities of the same kind, like two lengths or two areas, you can always find a whole number multiple of the smaller one that's bigger than the larger one. So no matter how tiny one line is compared to another, if you lay enough copies of the tiny one end to end, you'll eventually surpass the big one. That's the idea. It sounds obvious, maybe, but it formally guarantees you can form meaningful ratios between magnitudes. It only works for magnitudes of the same type, though you can't compare a length and an area this way. Got it. Axiom of comparability. What's next? Second, the principle of exhaustion itself. This is actually Euclid's proposition X.1. Ah, the core idea formalized as a proposition. Yes. It says if you start with some magnitude and you repeatedly subtract more than half of what's left, you'll eventually end up with a magnitude smaller than any tiny magnitude you chose beforehand. So keep taking away more than half, and you can shrink the remainder down below any target, no matter how small. Exactly. And Boyer pointed out it works even if you subtract at least half, or really any fixed fraction, each time. The key is you're guaranteed to get arbitrarily small. Okay, that's crucial for making the gap disappear conceptually. What else? Third, he needed Euclid 12.1, which relates similar plane figures. It says their areas are proportional to the squares of their corresponding sides. Like the area of similar triangles relates to the squares of their bases? Precisely. And fourth, another proposition, Euclid eel point 1.1, which deals with proportional relationships in similar rectangles. It's a bit more technical. Okay, so a whole toolkit of geometric principles. How did Eudoxus use these with exhaustion to prove the circle area thing? 12.2. He used that double reductio ad absurdum proof we talked about. Right, assume it's false and show that leads to contradiction. Exactly. He'd start by saying, suppose the ratio of the areas of two circles is not the same as the ratio of the squares of their diameters. Okay, so the ratio of areas is either bigger or smaller than the ratio of the squared diameters. Correct. Let's take the bigger case. Assume area 1 area 2 is greater than diameter 1 2 diameter 2 2. Right. Now he inscribes polygons in both circles. Using the principle of exhaustion, X1, he knows he can make the polygons so close to the circles that the leftover area, the little crescent bits, is smaller than whatever tiny amount is needed to mess up the inequality he assumed. Okay, so the polygon areas get really close
