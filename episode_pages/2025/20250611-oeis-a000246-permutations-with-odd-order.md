Learn about OEIS A000246 Permutations With Odd Order

## Transcript

Welcome back to The Deep Dive. We're continuing our journey through the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS. It's just such a goldmine, especially if you're into number theory or combinatorics. Absolutely. And today we've picked out a really interesting one to dig into. Sequence A000246. Right. The OEIS description calls it the number of permutations in the symmetric group SN that have odd order. Now that sounds fairly simple on the surface. But as we look through the source material, you know, research papers, some background articles, even online math forums, it turns out there's, well, quite a bit packed into that definition, some really neat connections. So our mission today is to unpack what odd order really means for this specific sequence, A000246, and explore some of the fascinating properties that popped out from the research. Let's dive in. First off, SN in the symmetric group. That's just all the ways you can rearrange the numbers 1, 2 up there, right? The permutations. Exactly. All possible shuffles. And a really fundamental tool for understanding any permutation is breaking it down into disjoint cycles. Disjoint cycles. Like cycles that don't share any numbers. Precisely. Any permutation can be uniquely written as a product of these non-overlapping cycles. The sources all emphasize this decomposition. Okay, like if we're in S4, the permutation swapping 1 and 2 and swapping 3 and 4, that's 1, 2 times 3, 4, two disjoint cycles. Perfect example. Now, the standard definition of the order of a permutation, this is basic group theory, is the least common multiple, the LCM, of the lengths of those disjoint cycles. Right, so for your example, 1, 2, 3, 4, the lengths are 2 and 2. LCM 2, 2 is 2, so order 2. Correct. Or say a single cycle, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in S5, length is 5. LCM of just 5 is 5, order 5. Makes sense. But, and this is the crucial point from the main research paper for A000246. Ah, here's the twist. Yes. This sequence, A000246, does not count permutations where the LCM of the cycle lengths is odd. Wait, really? That seems like the natural interpretation of odd order. It does, but the paper defines it differently. A000246 counts permutations where every single cycle in the disjoint decomposition has an odd length. Every single one. Okay, so let's take that example. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in S6. Cycle lengths are 3 and 3, both odd. Correct. So that one is counted by A000246, and its LCM is 3, which happens to be odd. Okay. What about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in S5? Lengths are 3 and 2. Ah, see, there's an even length cycle, the 4, 5. So even though the length 3 cycle is odd... It doesn't count because not all cycles are odd length. Exactly. It's not counted by A000246, and its LCM, LCM 3, 2, is 6, which is even anyway. Got it. So the definition for this sequence is super specific. All cycle lengths must be odd. That's what odd order means here. Precisely. The paper is very clear, whose every cycle is of odd length. That's the rule for A000246. Okay, good to clarify. Now, another point of confusion that came up in the discussions we looked at. The difference between odd order as we've just defined it and odd parity. Right, parity or signature. That's about whether you can get the permutation by an even or odd number of two-element swaps, called transpositions. Yeah, the even and odd permutations. Even ones have signature plus 1, odd ones have minus 1. You can figure it out from inversions or the cycles too, right? Yes, and the cycle method is relevant here. The parity of a single cycle of length L is given by minus 1 to the power of L1. Which is the part that always feels backwards. It really does. So if a cycle has odd length, say L3, then L1 equals 2, and minus 1 to 2 is plus 1. So an odd length cycle has even parity, plus 1. Correct. And if a cycle has even length, say L2, L1 is 0 and minus 1 to 1 is minus 1. So an even length cycle have odd parity, minus 1. Exactly. Odd length cycles are even permutations, even length cycles are odd permutations. It's easy to get tangled. Okay, okay. So odd length cycle means even parity, plus 1. Now think about the permutations counted by A000246. We just established they only have cycles of odd length. Right. Every single cycle has odd length. And we just said every odd length cycle has even parity, signature plus 1. Ah, so if you decompose a permutation counted by A000246, you only get cycles with parity plus 1. And the parity of the whole permutation is the product of the parities of its cycles. So you're just multiplying plus 1 by plus 1 by plus 1, which always gives plus 1. Precisely. This is a key takeaway from the sources, especially the Wikipedia and Reddit threads you found. Every permutation counted by 000246, every permutation whose cycles all have odd length, must be an even permutation. Wow. Okay, so the sequence counting odd order permutations is actually a sequence counting a specific subset of the even permutations. That's not what you'd guess from the name. It's a beautiful structural consequence, isn't it? The cycle length property directly dictates the overall parity. The name refers only to the lengths. Okay, that's a great clarification. So we know what we're counting. Permutations with only odd length cycles. Now how many are there? That's A000246 itself. Right. The sequence starts 1, 1, 3, 9, 45, 225. Grows quite fast. Let's quickly check the first few, just to make sure this all hangs together. Oh yeah. For n equals 1, S1 only has the identity. 1. Cycle length 1. That's odd. So count is 1. A0002461 matches. For n equals 2, S2 has the identity 1, 2, and the swap 1, 2. Identity has lengths 1 and 1, both odd. Counts. The swap 1, 2 has lengths 2, even. Doesn't count. So just one permutation. A0002462 matches again. For n equals 3, S3, we have the identity 1, 2, 3. Lengths 1, 1, 1. All odd. Counts. We have the 3 cycles, 1, 2, 3, and 1, 3, 2. Length 3, odd. Both count. And the transpositions. 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3. Each involves an element fixed, so they look like 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3. Right. So their cycle decomposition, so like length 2 and length 1, contains an even length cycle. The 2 so they don't count. Exactly. So for n equals 3, we have the identity plus the 2, 3 cycles. That's 1 plus 2 equals 3 permutations. A0002463. It works. Okay. The definition seems solid. Now you mentioned connections. The sources point to something quite remarkable, don't they? They do. The research paper highlights this amazing result. The number of these permutations we've been discussing, the ones with all odd cycle lengths for a given n, is exactly equal to the number of something called ballot permutations of length n. Ballot permutations. Okay. What are those? Sounds completely different. It does, doesn't it? The definition is quite different. It relates to sequences and ensuring that prefixes satisfy certain conditions, often related to ascents and descents, like votes in an election where one candidate never trails. The exact definition involves ensuring the height of prefixes stays non-negative. So one count is based on cycle structure, the other on sequential properties. And they give the same number. Exactly the same number. A000246 counts both sets. This number, let's call it PCN, even has a formula involving double factorials. Right, the double factorial. N, that's N, N2, N4, down to 1 or 2. The formula for PN, which is A000246N, is if N is even, it's N1. And if 1, double factorial squared. And if N is odd, it's N, N2. You usually define negus 1 as 1 for this. Let's quickly test N4, it's even. So 4N squared equals 3 squared. 3 is 31, is 3, so 3 squared is 9. And A0002464 is indeed 9. And for N3, odd. So 3 and 3, 3 and 3, 1, negus 3, 1, negus 3. Which is A000246. The formulas work beautifully. The paper also mentions a recurrence, PN, PN1, plus N1, N2, PN2. Wow. That equality is pretty stunning. That two such different combinatorial descriptions lead to the same count
