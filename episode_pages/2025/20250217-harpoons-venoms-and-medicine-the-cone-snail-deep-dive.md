## Transcript

Hey everyone and welcome back for another deep dive. Today we are heading to the ocean to explore a creature that's both beautiful and deadly. Beautiful and deadly, that's a great way to put it. We're talking about cone snails. You know those gorgeous shells you sometimes see on the beach? Oh yeah, those intricate patterns and vibrant colors, definitely eye-catching. Well those shells belong to some seriously fascinating predators. We're diving into the world of cone snails and their potent venom, conotoxins. To help us unpack all of this, we'll be using two Wikipedia articles. One on cone snails themselves and another specifically on conotoxins. It's amazing how much information is packed into those articles. It's really a deep dive in itself. Right, and we're going to uncover some truly mind-blowing facts. Did you know that these snails actually use harpoons to catch their prey? Harpoons? You're not kidding, it's like something out of a science fiction movie. I know, it's incredible. And their venom, it's not just one single toxin. We're talking about a complex cocktail of hundreds of different compounds, each with its own unique target. It's like a high-tech pharmacy but in a tiny snail. Exactly, and get this, some cone snails even mimic the mating signals of worms to lure in their unsuspecting prey. Talk about sneaky. Oh yeah, those snails are masters of deception. But it's not all about danger and intrigue. Cone snail venom, while deadly, also holds incredible potential for new medicines. Absolutely. Researchers are finding ways to use these toxins to treat pain, neurological disorders, and even some types of cancer. So much to uncover. To kick things off, maybe you could give us a quick overview of cone snails in general. What exactly are they and where do they fit in the grand scheme of ocean life? Sure. Cone snails are a type of sea snail. But we're not talking about your average garden variety snail here. Right, these are way cooler. They belong to the Conus genus and get this, there are over 900 different species. Most of them live in warm tropical waters, but some have adapted to cool environments like the coast of South Africa or even the Mediterranean. Wow, so adaptable. They really get around. They do, and those beautiful shells we were talking about, they come in a dazzling array of colors and patterns. It's one of the things that makes them so fascinating, but also a bit of a headache for scientists trying to classify them. Oh, how so? Well, all that variation has led to a ton of synonyms and probable synonyms in their taxonomy. It can be a real puzzle trying to figure out which ones are distinct species and which ones are just variations within a species. It sounds like trying to sort through a giant box of mismatched socks. Kind of. There's this one shell, Conus gloriamaris. It's known as the Glory of the Seas and was once one of the rarest and most sought-after shells. But then its habitat was discovered and the price plummeted. Ouch, I bet that was a shock to collectors. But let's not get too distracted by those pretty shells because these creatures are, after all, predators. How do they actually hunt and what makes them so dangerous? Well, they're carnivores, which means they eat meat. Their diet can include marine worms, small fish, mollusks, and even other cone snails. Snail-eat-snail world out there, huh? You could say that, but how do they catch their prey? Remember those harpoons we mentioned? Oh yeah, the super cool weapon? Exactly. They have this modified tooth called a radula that's basically a sharp, barbed harpoon. It's connected to a venom gland and when they spot their prey, they extend a long tube called a proboscis, almost like a built-in draw. So they basically spear their prey and inject the venom all in one go? Yep, it's incredibly efficient and deadly. And get this, some species have evolved to mimic the sex pheromones of certain worms. Whoa, what? That's some next-level trickery. I know, the worm thinks it's about to meet a mate and then bam, dinner is served. So sneaky. Okay, let's dive into the venom itself, those conotoxins. What exactly are they and what makes them so different from, say, snake venom? What's fascinating about conotoxins is that they're not just one single toxin. They're complex mixtures of hundreds of different compounds called peptides. And here's the key. Each peptide has a very specific target in the body. Some block signals between nerves and muscles, others interfere with the way our bodies transmit pain signals. It's incredibly precise. So each type of cone snail has basically tailored its venom to be super effective against its preferred prey. Exactly. They've evolved over millions of years to create this incredible arsenal of chemical weapons. It's really remarkable. So it's like a personalized pharmacy of toxins, each one designed for a specific purpose. That's a great way to put it. You mentioned different types of conotoxins and their effects. Can you break it down a little further? What are some of the main players in this venom cocktail and what do they actually do? Well, there are a bunch of different families of conotoxins. They're named after Greek letters, which makes them a bit easier to keep track of. For instance, there are alpha conotoxins, which block signals between nerves and muscles. Then you have the delta conotoxins, which mess with the way sodium channels work in nerves. And the kappa conotoxins, which go after potassium channels. So alpha, delta, kappa, it's like a fraternity of toxins. Haha, I guess you could say that. And those are just a few examples. There are plenty more where those came from. Okay, so we've got alpha, delta, and kappa. What other important conotoxins should we be aware of? Well, there's mu conotoxin, which specifically targets sodium channels in muscles. And perhaps the most interesting one for us humans is omega conotoxin. Interesting for us? Why is that? Because omega conotoxin blocks calcium channels that are involved in transmitting pain signals. So it could potentially be used as a painkiller. Exactly. And as we'll discuss later, it actually already is, but we'll get to that in a bit. For now, let's talk about the dangers of cone snails themselves. Okay, so we've established that they have this ridiculously complex venom system with all sorts of different conotoxins. But how dangerous are they really? Could a casual encounter with a cone snail on the beach actually be deadly? Well, it really depends on the species of cone snail. Some of the smaller ones that feed on worms might just give you a painful sting, kind of like a bee sting. Okay, so not too bad, just a little ouch. Right, but the larger species that hunt fish, those can be incredibly dangerous, even fatal to humans. Their venom is incredibly potent. I've heard of a cone snail nicknamed the cigarette snail. What's the story there? Ah, yes, the Conus geographus. It got that nickname because supposedly after being stung by one, you'd only have enough time to smoke a cigarette before, well, you get the picture. Yikes, that's a pretty dark nickname. It is, but it highlights the seriousness of these snails. They're not to be trifled with. Definitely a good reminder to be careful what you pick up at the beach. But here's the thing that I find fascinating. If these conotoxins are so deadly, how can they also have potential for medicine? Isn't that kind of a paradox? It is a bit of a paradox, but that's what makes this research so exciting. It's like finding a weapon that can be repurposed into a shield. The same properties that make conotoxins dangerous can also make them incredibly valuable for treating certain conditions. So it's about understanding those specific targets and figuring out how to use them for good. Exactly. Remember that omega conotoxin we talked about, the one that blocks pain signals? Well, scientists have actually developed a pain medication called ziconotide that's derived from that specific conotoxin. Wow, so they've actually harnessed the power of this deadly venom to create a painkiller. Yep, and it's not just any painkiller. Ziconotide is actually 1,000 times more potent than morphine. That's incredible. It's amazing what science can achieve when it comes to understanding and manipulating nature. It really is, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. There's so much more to discover about conotoxins and their potential applications. This is already blowing my mind, and we're just getting started. It really shows you the power of these toxins and how we can harness them for good. It's mind-blowing. So by studying these venomous snails, scientists have basically unlocked a whole new approach to pain management. What other medical possibilities are out there? The potential of conotoxins goes way beyond just pain relief. Researchers are exploring their use for all sorts of conditions, including neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Wow, those are some serious conditions. Imagine if we could use these target toxins to block the specific signals that cause tremors or memory loss. It could be revolutionary for so many people. It's incredible to think that something so dangerous could hold the key to treating such debilitating diseases. It really highlights the ingenuity of nature and the power of scientific research to find those hidden gems. Absolutely, and we can't forget the cultural significance of these creatures, too. You know, those beautiful shells have been prized by collectors for centuries. Oh, yeah, I've seen those elaborate collections. And they even play a role in traditional jewelry. Remember those puka shell necklaces? Oh, yeah, those were super popular. Those iconic pieces, especially in Hawaiian culture, are made from
