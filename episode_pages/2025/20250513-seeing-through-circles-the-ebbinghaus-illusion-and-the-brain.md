## Description

A deep dive into one of psychologyâ€™s classic visual tricksâ€”the Ebbinghaus illusion. We explore how the brain constructs size, what it reveals about perception and action pathways, and how genetics, development, and culture shape our susceptibility. From early debates about vision to cross-cultural findings that emerge in childhood, this episode shows why seeing isnâ€™t just about photonsâ€”it's about the brain guiding behavior and interpretation.

## Transcript

Welcome back to Science Corner here on The Deep Dive. Great to be here. Today we're tackling a really classic visual puzzle, one that actually tells us a surprising amount about how our brains put the world together. It's the Ebbinghaus illusion. Ah, yes, the two central circles. They're exactly the same size physically, but they certainly don't look it, do they? Not at all. The one surrounded by tiny circles looks, well, bigger. And the one next to the large circle seems to shrink. It's also known as Titchener's circles. And yeah, it seems simple, maybe just a fun visual trick, but it's been incredibly useful for scientists trying to understand perception. Exactly. So today we're going beyond just what it is. We've got some fascinating research lined up that looks at, you know, how our brains handle this, how it changes as we grow up, even how it differs across cultures. It really gets into the nuts and bolts of how we see, doesn't it? We're not just passively receiving images. Our brain is actively constructing what we perceive. So let's get started. Where does this illusion fit into the bigger picture of neuroscience research? Okay, well, one of its most significant roles, historically anyway, was in the big debate about how vision guides our actions versus how it shapes our conscious perception. You mean the idea that there might be separate brain pathways for like seeing an object and actually reaching out to grab it? Precisely. The famous two streams hypothesis. The Ebbinghaus illusion became a key testing ground for this. Right. Because the question was, okay, the illusion clearly fools our eyes, our perception of the size. Yeah. We see one circle as bigger. But does it also fool our hand when we go to pick it up? Exactly. And there was some really influential work by Melvin Goodale and his colleagues suggesting that remarkably, it often doesn't fool the hand. Really? Yeah. They found that when people reached out to grasp the central circle, the way they shaped their hand, their grip aperture actually matched the real size of the circle, not the size it appeared to be because of the illusion. Wow. So it's like one part of the brain sees the illusion, but another part, the action part, somehow knows the truth? That was the interpretation, yeah. It was strong evidence for these two separate visual streams, one for conscious perception, easily fooled by the illusion, and another for guiding action, which seemed more resistant. But is it really that clear-cut? Is the science settled on that? Well, like a lot of things in neuroscience, it's become a bit more nuanced. While Goodale's findings were groundbreaking, other studies came along suggesting that actually sometimes our actions can be influenced by the illusion too. It might depend on the exact task or the timing or other factors. So the relationship between those perception and action streams, it seems it's probably more interconnected and complex than a simple split. It's definitely still an active area of research. So the illusion is still a really useful tool for probing these kinds of questions. Let's shift focus a bit to the brain itself. What happens inside our heads when we're looking at this? Have brain imaging studies given us any clues? They have, and some really interesting ones too. Neuroimaging work using fMRI, for instance, has found a rather surprising correlation. It seems there's an inverse relationship between how strongly someone experiences the Ebbinghaus illusion and other similar size illusions like the Ponzo illusion and the physical size of their primary visual cortex. That's the area called V1. Wait, hang on. Inverse. So people with the bigger V1, more brain area for initial visual processing, are less fooled by the illusion. That's what the evidence suggests, yeah. It feels a bit backward at first glance, doesn't it? It really does. You'd think more processing power would make you more susceptible, or at least not less. The thinking behind it, though, is that maybe a larger V1 allows for a greater separation, neurologically speaking, between the representation of the central target circle and the surrounding context circles that cause the illusion. Okay, like more neural real estate keeps them further apart. Sort of. That increased separation might reduce the influence of the context on how the size of the central circle is perceived. So more space might mean less interference from the surroundings. That's a neat idea. Almost like better focus. Is it just about the brain's structure, or are there other biological factors involved? What about genetics? Good question. There's definitely a suggestion of genetic influence, too. Fairly recent work has actually identified something like 70 different genetic variations that seem to correlate with how strongly individuals perceive the Ebbinghaus illusion. 70 variants. So our susceptibility isn't just random. It might be partly baked into our DNA. It certainly points that way. It suggests there's likely an inherited component influencing just how much this visual trick affects our perception, alongside brain structure and, of course, environmental factors. Right, it's always that mix, isn't it? Nature and nurture. Okay, so we've got brain structure, genetics. What about development? How does our experience of the illusion change as we grow up? This brings in a really important concept, context sensitivity. How much attention do we pay to the surrounding context when we're looking at something? Developmental research suggests that our susceptibility to the Ebbinghaus illusion is tied pretty closely to how context-sensitive our visual processing is. And how does that change with age? Do we get more or less sensitive to context? Generally, we seem to become more sensitive to context as we mature. There was a key study, Doherty and colleagues back in 2010, I think. They compared university students with children aged 10 and under, and they found the students, who tend to be highly context-sensitive, were much more fooled by the illusion than the younger kids were. Really? So little kids might actually see the circles more accurately? Often, yes. The study concluded that the illusion strongly deceives adults but often doesn't trick children under 10. That's wild. Why would that be? Are younger kids just not processing the surrounding circles in the same way? That's one leading idea. Perhaps their visual system is more focused on processing individual objects or elements in isolation, rather than integrating everything into a whole scene quite as readily as adults do. As we get older and better at that integration, we become more susceptible to illusions that rely on that contextual processing. So developing that sophisticated visual integration makes us, ironically, more likely to be fooled by certain tricks. Fascinating. Now, does everyone develop this way? Does culture play a role here? Ah, now we get to some really groundbreaking stuff. Cross-cultural studies have thrown up some truly unexpected results when looking at the Ebbinghaus illusion. How so? Well, researchers compared people in the UK with the traditional Himba people in Namibia. The Himba live in a very different environment with much less exposure to, say, Western urban visual culture, things like carpentered corners, straight lines, pictorial representations. Right, a very different visual world. So what did they find? Did the Himba perceive the illusion differently? Dramatically differently, especially in childhood. The study found that traditional Himba children showed almost no susceptibility to the illusion until they were about 9 or 10 years old. No illusion, while UK kids are seeing it. Exactly. UK children in the same study showed a strong, robust illusion effect much earlier, starting around 7 or 8 years old. Wow, that's a huge difference. It really points to culture or maybe environment shaping perception very early on. It really does. And interestingly, this difference wasn't just a developmental lag. The greater susceptibility seen in the UK kids compared to the traditional Himba kids, once it emerged around age 9 or 10, seemed to remain stable right through to adulthood. So the pattern gets set early and sticks. Did they only look at traditional Himba or did they compare them with Himba living in more urban settings? They did that too, which is crucial. They included Himba children and adults living in nearby urbanized areas in Namibia. Did the urban environment make a difference? It absolutely did. Those living in the urban environment showed a greater susceptibility to the illusion compared to their traditional counterparts. And this was true across all the age groups they tested. So even within Namibia, urbanization seemed to push perception towards the pattern seen in the UK. That's what it looked like. The urban environment seemed to exert a consistent influence, nudging perception towards greater context sensitivity or at least greater susceptibility to this specific illusion. Okay, so the conclusion seems to be that these cross-cultural differences pop up early and are strongly linked to the environment, particularly urban versus traditional environments. Precisely. The researchers argued that how we process visual context differs across cultures. These differences emerge in childhood and the urban environment plays a significant role. So what's the mechanism behind that difference? Is it that different cultures are just fundamentally wired to perceive context differently? Or is it more about attention? Like, can some groups filter out the distracting context better than others? That's the core debate. The two main ideas are a perceptual bias versus attentional filtering. Explain those a bit. Okay, so perceptual bias suggests there's an inherent difference in the tendency to process context. Some cultures might be more holistic, focusing on the whole scene, while others are more analytic, focusing on the central object. Attentional filtering is more about the ability to consciously or unconsciously ignore the irrelevant stuff, the surrounding circles in this case. Right, one's about basic processing style, the other's about focus. Which way does the Ebbinghaus data point? Well, the developmental findings, the fact that these cross-cultural differences are already clear by age 9 or 10, seem to lean towards the perceptual bias account. Why is that? Because sophisticated attentional filtering abilities, the kind needed to actively ignore distractors, generally tend to mature a bit later
