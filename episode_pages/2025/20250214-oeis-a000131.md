## Transcript

Welcome back. We're diving back into the OEIS today. Back into that amazing online encyclopedia of integer sequences? You number theory fans out there. You're really going to like this one, I think. This one is sequence A000131. Oh yeah, A000131. What have we got? It's a classic, a classic sequence. It takes a familiar geometric polygon triangulation and kind of adds that layer of complexity with a combinatorial twist. So we all know how to divide polygons into triangles, right? Draw some non-intersecting lines between the vertices. But a 000131, this sequence, it's not interested in all those triangulations. No, it's much more selective than that. Okay. This sequence counts the asymmetrical triangulations of a polygon. Okay, so like if we had a square, there's only one way to divide it into two triangles. Right, and that's symmetrical. So the square doesn't actually contribute anything to A000131. This sequence actually starts at N equals 7 with the heptagon. And there are only two ways to asymmetrically triangulate a heptagon. Five ways for an octagon, and the numbers quickly climb from there. Now you mentioned combinatorial. Yeah. The description mentions Catalan numbers. Are we going to see those? Oh, absolutely. Catalan numbers are like the celebrities of the combinatorial world. They just pop up everywhere. And the formula for A000131 uses this really, really clever combination of Catalan numbers to account for all those symmetrical triangulations that we need to exclude. Now I know Catalan numbers from like balanced parentheses and binary trees. How do they relate to cutting up polygons? Okay, so think of it this way. Imagine we're trying to triangulate a pentagon. Right. We pick one side to be the base of a triangle, right? Right. So what we're left with are two smaller polygons on either side of that base. Yeah, I see the two smaller polygons that also need to be triangulated. That also need to be triangulated, and here's the really neat part. The ways to triangulate those smaller polygons are also counted by Catalan numbers. So we have that recursive structure going on. We do. And that's where the Catalan numbers come in. Exactly. We're breaking down this larger problem into smaller, self-similar problems. Wow. And that's a hallmark of where Catalan numbers appear. So this seemingly simple geometric problem of cutting up polygons leads us to this really complex area of combinatorics. It really does, and this particular connection was made clear by mathematician Richard K. Guy back in 1958. Wow. His work kind of laid the foundation for understanding this sequence and the formula. Speaking of that formula, I got to say, it looks a little intimidating. Yeah. Is there a way to understand what's going on without getting too lost in the math? Absolutely. At its core, the formula is this sophisticated counting machine. It starts by calculating all possible triangulations of a polygon, and then it systematically subtracts out the ones that have symmetry. So it's like a sieve. Yeah, like a sieve filtering out the symmetrical cases and leaving us with just those unique asymmetrical gems. That's a great analogy. So the way it does this sieving is through a clever manipulation of Catalan numbers. You got it. And then adjusting for the types of symmetries. This has been a really fascinating journey already. It has. We've gone from triangles and polygons to Catalan numbers. Pretty cool. Before we get too deep into the formula itself, I think it's time for a short break. Sounds good. So before the break, we were talking about how this sequence, A000131, acts as a filter, sifting out the symmetrical triangulations and leaving us with the asymmetrical ones. Right. But I'm curious about the numbers themselves, 252161. They seem to grow pretty quickly. Yeah, you've hit on a key observation. The rate of growth of a 000131 is really fascinating. Okay. And it's intrinsically linked to the growth of the Catalan numbers. Right, because those appear in the formula. So it's not like a simple linear increase. No. Is there something about these combinatorial problems that leads to this rapid growth? That's a great question. What's fascinating here is the growth reflects the increasing complexity as the number of sides in our polygon increases. Right. So with each additional side, the potential number of triangulations just explodes. Okay. And even though we're carefully subtracting those with symmetry, the remaining asymmetrical ones still increase at a remarkable rate. It seems counterintuitive. You'd think imposing this constraint of asymmetry would limit the number of possibilities, but it doesn't seem to at all. It really speaks to the power of combinatorics. Yeah. Even with seemingly restrictive conditions, the number of ways to arrange and combine elements can become astronomical. Now, we talked about how the formula for A000131 uses Catalan numbers to account for those symmetries. Right. Is there a way to kind of get an intuitive grasp of why Catalan numbers appear here? Absolutely. Let's go back to our example of choosing a base for a triangle within a polygon. Okay. When we make that choice, we're essentially dividing the larger polygon into two smaller ones. Right. And here's the crucial point. Okay. The number of ways to triangulate each of those smaller polygons is, you guessed it. I'm going to guess. Also counted by a Catalan number. Oh, so it's that recursive structure again. It is. Breaking down the complex problem into smaller, self-similar subproblems. Exactly. And that recursive nature is precisely what Catalan numbers are so good at capturing. So they're ubiquitous in combinatorics. They really are. They appear whenever we have problems that can be broken down this way. So it's like a mathematical fractal. It is like a mathematical fractal, the same pattern repeating at different scales. It's amazing how this simple act of dividing a polygon leads to such a profound concept. It is. And I love this idea of Catalan numbers as these hidden patterns. Yeah. Underlying so many seemingly unrelated problems. Yeah, it's like a secret code just waiting to be deciphered. So we've established that A000131 grows rapidly. Yes. And that growth is connected with Catalan numbers. Uh-huh. But we've been kind of dancing around this formula. We have. I know it looks intimidating. It can be a little bit. But I think our listener is ready. Okay. For the closer look. All right, let's do it. All right, I'm ready to be impressed. You got it. Okay, let's tackle this formula. I'm ready to be impressed. I want to see how it manages to count all these asymmetrical triangulations. All right, so it's all about this clever interplay of inclusion and exclusion. Okay. Remember, we start by counting all possible triangulations, right? Right. And the Catalan numbers provide that foundation. Yeah. But then we have to subtract out the triangulations that exhibit symmetry. So conceptually, I get that. But how does the formula actually do that? Well, let's think about the types of symmetry a polygon can have. Okay. We have rotational symmetry where you can rotate it by a certain angle and it looks the same. And then we've got reflectional symmetry where you flip it over a line. Right, like a mirror image. Exactly. So how do we account for those symmetries mathematically? Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. Well, that's where the formula gets a bit more intricate. Okay. It uses this combination of Catalan numbers and then these clever adjustments to account for all the ways a polygon can be rotated or reflected. So it's almost like the formula has to know about all the possible symmetries. It does. And then subtract accordingly. Exactly. It's like this precise surgical tool carefully removing those symmetrical triangulations from our count. Okay. And that leads us to those precise values in A000131. That's incredible. So even though the formula itself might seem really dense. Yeah. It's really just a very sophisticated way of performing this very specific counting task. It is. And the beauty is in how it leverages those fundamental combinatorial concepts like Catalan numbers and symmetry principles. Now we've been focused on this very strict definition of asymmetrical triangulation. Right. But what if we kind of relax those rules? Okay. What if we allowed some symmetries but not all? That's a great question. And it takes us to this fascinating frontier in this area. Okay. You're absolutely right. Relaxing those symmetry rules opens up a whole universe of related sequences. So instead of just A000131, we could have this whole family of sequences based on different levels of symmetry allowed. Exactly. We could have sequences that count triangulations with only rotational symmetry or only reflectional symmetry or maybe even specific combinations. Wow. And each of those sequences would likely have its own unique formula, likely still building on those Catalan numbers but with further modifications. It's like we've opened a door to a whole new area of mathematical exploration. And that's the beauty of mathematics, isn't it? There's always another layer to uncover. Another connection to make. Exactly. A journey of endless discovery. Well, I think we've done a great job dissecting A000131 today. We covered a lot of ground. We went from polygon triangulation to Catalan numbers. Yeah, and even glimpsed this exciting world of related sequences based on varying degrees of symmetry. It really shows how integer sequences can reveal these hidden connections. They really do. It's fascinating. I'm sure our number theory enthusiast out there has plenty to think about. Lots to ponder. Maybe they'll even discover a new sequence or two. You never know. Until next time, keep exploring and keep those mathematical minds engaged.
