## Description

A spirited dive into Plutarch's Parallel Lives. We pair Greek and Roman figuresâ€”from Alexander the Great to Julius Caesar, Demosthenes to Ciceroâ€”to explore how temperament, choices, and leadership shape destiny. Weâ€™ll examine the biographerâ€™s craft, the historical gaps, and the timeless question: what can these ancient portraits teach us about human nature today?

## Transcript

Welcome back everyone. We're diving into something pretty epic this time. Plutarch's Parallel Lives. Oh, this is a good one. Yeah, it's not just any history book. It's like who's who in the ancient world, Greeks and Romans matched up. We'll be using Plutarch, of course, but also the Wikipedia entry on Parallel Lives to get the full picture. Mixes. See what Plutarch himself says. How folks have viewed the work over time. Exactly. So we're talking famous pairings like putting Alexander the Great side by side with, say, Julius Caesar. Oh, that's classic Plutarch. He didn't just lay out the facts. He wanted to explore how these figures' characters, good and bad, shaped their destinies. So less about dates and battles, more about how personality drove their paths. You got it. Like were they ambitious, reckless, virtuous? How did that play out? Compared Demosthenes, the incredible orator, with Cicero on the Roman side, Plutarch illuminates what they had in common, their weaknesses, and ultimately their legacies. And Plutarch himself was more than just a biographer, wasn't he? Oh, way more. This guy was a philosopher, a historian, even an Apollonian priest. Now that one sounds intense. What did that even entail back then? Good question. Serving Apollo, the god of reason and order, probably had a huge impact on how Plutarch saw the world. That emphasis on character and destiny, you can see it woven all through his work. And what's interesting is Parallel Lives wasn't even his first set of biographies. Oh, really? What came before? He actually did a set on Roman emperors before this. Only problem is only two of those lives have survived, Galba and Otho. Ah, so we're lucky to have so much more to work with in Parallel Lives. Exactly. And the structure is so cool. Each pair has one Greek, one Roman folks with similar paths, and Plutarch gives us a comparison. It's like he's setting up a historical matchup. Makes you want to scorecard it. Who wins in terms of virtue or lasting impact? Right. But even with what we have, there are still some gaps. Like the lives of Epaminondas and one of the Scipio Africanuses are lost, and some others are incomplete. Always makes you wonder what else is out there, hidden away somewhere. Totally. But even with that, what we do have is praised for its lively writing. Plutarch didn't just give us dry facts. Yeah, I've heard that his Life of Alexander is a prime example. Super engaging, with anecdotes you won't find anywhere else. A must-read if you really want to get Alexander the Great. Totally agree. And that personal touch is everywhere, even in his Life of Caesar. That's one of the main sources we have on Caesar's achievements, and it's packed with gripping stories about Caesar and the soldiers under him. Oh, and speaking of those soldiers, there's this passage about their loyalty and bravery. Just incredible. I mean, was this typical, or was Plutarch trying to make a point? I think Plutarch definitely used these stories to show the power of Caesar's leadership. He created incredible bonds with his troops, like crazy devotion. I could imagine, you know, like the stories of Silius. This soldier, he lost his hand in a naval battle. Yeah, but get this, he kept fighting. Wait, seriously? He used his shield to keep enemies away, and he even helped capture their ship. Plutarch was showing the kind of men who served Caesar, their character. He lost a hand and still kept going. I mean, that's some serious dedication. Was that typical for Roman soldiers, that resilience? Or was this guy just superhuman? Well, this guy was definitely courageous. And then you have Cassius Scaeva at the Battle of Dyrrachium. Arrow to the eye, javelin to the shoulder, another to the thigh. Plus, over 100 missiles hit his shield. Okay, now this guy sounds superhuman. And he still outsmarted two enemies. Cut off one guy's shoulder, sent the other one running. Finally, his comrades rescued him. Plutarch wasn't just sharing battle stats. He was highlighting these soldiers' incredible characters. Yeah, painting a very specific picture of the Roman military for sure. And did he have any other examples to illustrate this? Oh, yeah. There's the scene from the campaign in Britain. Some of Caesar's centurions were trapped in a marsh, surrounded. And right in front of Caesar, this soldier, he just charges in to save them. No way. That's crazy brave. Was this like a common thing, soldiers risking it all to impress Caesar? Or was there something more to it? Well, the soldier fought like crazy, routed the enemy, saved the centurions. But it's what happens next that really shows you what the Roman military was about. He goes back to Caesar totally distraught, begging forgiveness because he lost his shield. Ah, right, right. Losing your shield was a huge disgrace. It meant abandoning your comrades, like failing your duty. Exactly. And to show you just how seriously the Romans took this, Plutarch gives us another example. Granius Petro, a quaestor. Scipio captured him in Africa and offered him his life. Granius refused, said Caesar's soldiers offer mercy, not receive it. And he took his own life rather than surrender. That's intense. Talk about a code of honor. But Plutarch didn't just focus on military figures, right? He compared all sorts of people. Oh, absolutely. He saw parallels everywhere, like Lycurgus of Sparta, the lawgiver, paired with Numa Pompilius of Rome, who also established laws and religious stuff. Plutarch was fascinated by how individuals, no matter their field, could really shape society. It's like he's saying, hey, we can learn from these guys, even if they lived centuries ago. Totally. He pairs people from different cultures, different times even, and shows us their ambitions, struggles, triumphs. It's a reminder that being human goes beyond time and place. So if we're talking about these iconic pairings, which ones are, like, the most famous? A few jump out right away. You've got Theseus, the mythical founder of Athens, matched up with Romulus, Rome's legendary founder. Then there's Alcibiades, the Athenian general, brilliant but flawed, paired with Coriolanus, who had that same ambitious but ultimately exiled trajectory. And, of course, the big one, Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. Now, those are some heavy hitters. It's like watching an epic historical drama unfold. And we can't forget about Demosthenes and Cicero, right? The masters of public speaking going head to head. It's funny, though, how opinions differ on which lives are considered Plutarch's best. Oh, absolutely. Those pairings are popular, but the cool thing about parallel lives is that every reader finds their own favorites. Some folks love the life of Antonius. Some think the life of Caesar is the top one. I even read that some scholars call Plutarch's depiction of Alcibiades a masterpiece of characterization. Makes you want to go back and read it with fresh eyes. Totally. The depth and richness of Plutarch's writing means there's no one best life. People find their own personal connections. Sounds like Parallel Lives is one of those works you can keep coming back to throughout your life, always discovering something new. But it's more than just a bunch of interesting stories, right? There's a bigger message here. Oh, for sure. At its heart, Parallel Lives is about the human condition, those things that stay the same no matter the time period. He shows us that even these figures who led ages ago dealt with stuff we still deal with today. So it's not just about ancient history. It's about gaining insights into human nature, period. Precisely. Looking at the choices and consequences of these figures, it gives us a new perspective on our own lives. It's like Plutarch's holding up a mirror saying, hey, look at these guys, their virtues, their flaws. Think about the paths you choose. I like that, the mirror analogy. It's like he's saying, these were real people dealing with issues we still face. Can we learn from their wins, avoid their mistakes? But is that a bit, I don't know, presumptuous? Can we really apply lessons from ancient times to our modern world? That's a great question. I bet Plutarch himself thought about that. He wasn't saying to just copy the past blindly, but he believed that by studying those who came before us, we gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the challenges we face. Parallel Lives isn't just a history book. It's a timeless look at human nature and how powerful it is. So for our listeners who are itching to dive into Parallel Lives, where would you recommend they start? I'd say pick a pairing that grabs your attention. Maybe one with a historical figure you already admire or a period that you're interested in. There are so many amazing stories to uncover, so many insights to gain. You might even learn something new about yourself in the process. That's what I love about these deep dives. There's always something new to learn, something to explore. Thanks for taking us through Plutarch's Parallel Lives with us. My pleasure. Always happy to dive into these fascinating topics. It really does make you think, doesn't it? The lasting impact of these stories, the insights they give us. But I've heard some folks say that Plutarch sometimes, you know, stretched the truth a bit for a better story. Like he wasn't always super accurate historically. Yeah, that's a common criticism of Plutarch. And it's true that he
