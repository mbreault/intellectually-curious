## Description

A practical tour of FVAâ€”the framework that separates value from noise in forecasting. We break down the basics, compare it to naive benchmarks, and explore real-world use across retail, manufacturing, healthcare, finance, and supply chain. Learn how to identify which steps truly add predictive value, uncover biases, and apply data-driven decisions to improve forecasts and business outcomes.

## Transcript

All right, so you sent over a whole stack of stuff on forecast value added or FVA. And when I first saw it, I was like, okay, is this going to be a little dry? But I have to say, once I started digging in, it really got interesting. There's so much more to it than I expected. It really is. It's one of those concepts that seems kind of basic on the surface, but when you get into it, there's a lot there. And I think it's, you know, a lot of what we're trying to do in forecasting generally is just trying to figure out how to make better decisions. And how to kind of figure out what works and what doesn't. Exactly. And that's what I think you're looking for here, right? You really want to understand this FVA thing. Right. Not just get a quick definition. We're going to really dig into what it is, why it's become so popular in so many different fields. Yeah. And maybe even, you know how you can use it in your own work? A lot of people have this kind of intuitive sense that, you know, there's things we do when we forecast that are valuable and things that aren't. And I think what FVA gives you is it gives you a framework to actually measure that and make data-driven decisions about where to focus your efforts. Because, you know, gut feels one thing, but being able to actually show, you know, this is adding value or this is not adding value is really powerful. Yeah. It's like having a magnifying glass for your predictions, right? We can really zoom in and say, okay, this part of the process, this is adding value. This part's just noise. Maybe even this part is actually hurting our accuracy. And sometimes the answer isn't what you think it's going to be. Yeah. You know? Yeah. I think there was one study that showed that sometimes sales teams' really detailed forecasts were less accurate than just saying nothing's going to change from last month. Wow. So you think all that effort, all that expertise would lead to a better forecast. Yeah. But it was actually just adding bias. Yeah. It's counterintuitive, right? You think more information is always better. Right. But in this case, it wasn't. So I think, okay, let's start with like the real basis. What is FVA in a nutshell? It's essentially a way to measure how much each step in your forecasting process changes the accuracy of the final forecast. Got it. So it's really trying to break down and say, okay, we're doing all these things. What's the incremental value of each piece? Okay. So I'm getting that, but can we make it a little more concrete for people? Sure. What's a simple example? So think about it maybe like A-B testing, you know, in marketing. You're probably familiar with that concept where you have two different versions of a web page or something like that, and you want to see which one performs better. FVA is kind of like the A-B testing of forecasting. You're comparing different approaches and measuring which one leads to the most accurate prediction. Okay. I like that. So if I add a step where I consult with a panel of experts, FVA would tell me, like, did that actually improve my forecast? Exactly. And that's where this idea of a naive forecast comes in. That's a simple baseline prediction that we use as a benchmark in FVA. So you're setting a low bar and saying, like, can you beat even this super basic prediction? Exactly. A common naive model is the no-change model, where you just assume the future is going to be the same as the present. So, for example, if you sold 100 widgets last month, your naive forecast would be to sell 100 widgets this month. That seems so simple. Like, why would you even bother doing anything more complicated? You'd be surprised. Sometimes those simple naive forecasts work really well. And that's kind of the point of FVA, is to say, like, are we actually adding value with all this extra stuff we're doing? Right. Or would we be better off just sticking with something simple? Like we're cutting through the clutter, right? Exactly. Getting to what really matters. I'm starting to see why this has gotten so popular. And, you know, I think what's really interesting, too, is that FVA isn't just about improving accuracy. It's also about understanding why certain steps are valuable and what's driving those improvements. And so I think, you know, the insights you get from that can go beyond just forecasting and help you make better decisions across your organization. Right. It's like a deeper understanding of your business. Exactly. Not just, you know, a number. Right. So you mentioned before that FVA has applications across, like, a ton of different industries. Like, I think you said retail manufacturing, health care, finance, even supply chain management. Yeah. I mean, really, it's pretty ubiquitous at this point. We're seeing it across all kinds of different organizations. So give us a little taste of that. Like, how is this actually being used in the real world? Let's start with retail. I think that's something everyone can kind of relate to. Sure. So, you know, think about those apparel retailers, for example, the ones with these massive supply chains. They're forecasting demand. You know, they want to make sure they have the right clothes in the right stores at the right time. And a lot of times you have, you know, planners who are really experienced and they're making adjustments to these statistically generated forecasts based on their knowledge of trends. Right. Their gut feel for what's going to sell. So it's like data plus that human intuition. Exactly. It's kind of blending those two things together. Yeah. But what some retailers are finding is that those manual overrides, those adjustments, even from seasoned professionals, they don't always add value. Yeah. In fact, in some cases they've found that those adjustments actually decreased forecast accuracy. So they would have been better off just sticking with the data. Right. That's surprising. It is. And it highlights the importance of questioning our assumptions, even those that seem like common sense. You know, FBA gives you the data to really back up your decisions. Yeah. That's a great example. What about manufacturing? I imagine forecasting is huge there too. Absolutely. So manufacturers, they need to forecast demand for their products so they can make sure they have the right materials and production capacity in place. And, you know, a lot of times there's multiple layers of input to the forecasting process. You have sales, you have marketing, you have operations, all kind of feeding into that final forecast. It sounds like it could get pretty complicated. It can be. And that's where FBA could be really helpful because it allows you to say, okay, we've got all these different people, all these different steps. Are any of these actually adding value? One automotive parts supplier, they found that while management overrides sometimes improve the forecast slightly, the gains were so small that they didn't justify the time and effort involved. Interesting. And so it was actually more cost effective to just stick with that initial statistically generated forecast. So it's like FBA helps you find that sweet spot between complexity and efficiency. Exactly. What about healthcare? That's not an industry I immediately think of when I think about forecasting. You might be surprised. I mean, healthcare providers, they need to forecast patient demand so they know how many beds, how much staff, how much equipment they need to have available. And then you've got pharmaceutical companies. They're using forecasting to predict drug demand managed inventory. One medical equipment company, they used FBA to analyze their sales forecasts. And they found that their sales team had a systematic bias towards being overly optimistic. Oh, wow. Which was leading to all sorts of problems, excess inventory, lost revenue. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you know, we really helped them identify a blind spot in their process. It's like uncovering these hidden biases. Right. That are affecting our predictions that we're not even aware of. Right. And then finance. Oh, yeah, finance, of course. I mean, financial analysts, you know, they live and breathe forecasts, right? From revenue projections to budget planning to risk assessment. Yeah. And FBA can help them determine whether all these, you know, adjustments that get made to those forecasts. Right. Are they actually adding value? Are they just adding noise? There was one article you sent over about a company that was using FBA to evaluate their revenue forecasts. Oh, right. Yeah. So they were doing this analysis. Yeah. And what they found was that the initial statistically generated revenue forecast was often more accurate. Wow. Than the versions that had been adjusted by, you know, regional sales managers. Yeah. These managers were trying to hit their targets. Right. And so they were, you know, subconsciously inflating their projections. Yeah. And it was actually hurting the accuracy of the company's overall forecasting. That's so interesting how sometimes like even well-intentioned human intervention can backfire. It's a classic case of bias creeping into the process. Yeah. And FBA helps you identify that. Okay. So we've seen how FBA is being applied across all these different industries. But what about supply chain management? That's kind of where it can start, right? That's right. I mean, FBA has really become essential in supply chain management. I mean, it's used to identify the most accurate forecasting methods for different types of products. Right. To evaluate the impact of promotional activities. Yeah. To assess the value of collaboration with suppliers. Right. I mean, it really touches on so many different aspects. And I know you mentioned some big names like Intel and Cisco. Yeah. I think Nestle, Yokohama Tire. Right. Those are just a few examples. I mean, there's tons of companies out there. Right.
