## Description

We explore A000028 from the OEIS: the number of equivalence classes of binary strings of length 2n that repeat with period 2n, where each period contains an even number of 1s. Two blocks are considered the same if you can cyclically rotate them (translate around the circle) or swap 0s and 1s (complement). Weâ€™ll unpack what 'even' means in this context, what 'period 2n' means, and why counting these patterns matters. Weâ€™ll walk through simple examples, discuss the kinds of formulas and references the OEIS entry provides, and connect these ideas to the broader notion of binary necklaces and symmetry.

## Transcript

Ever find yourself noticing patterns, like everywhere, maybe tiles on a floor or, I don't know, music? Oh, absolutely. Humans are pattern-seeking machines, aren't we? Totally. And today, we're diving into a really specific mathematical kind of pattern. We're using the amazing online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS. A fantastic resource. Isn't it? We're focusing on one entry, 00020. Right. 00028. It sounds maybe a bit dry, the number of even sequences with period 2n, but there's some really neat stuff packed in there. That's the plan. We want to unpack what these even sequences with period 2n actually are. What's the even part mean? What's period 2n? And, you know, why count them? Exactly. The OEIS entry itself is our guide here. It gives us definitions, examples, formulas, the works. So let's start with the basics. What kind of sequences are we talking about? Okay, so first off, these are binary sequences. Just zeros and ones. Like computer code at its most fundamental. Zeros and ones. Got it. And the period 2n part? That means the sequence repeats itself after a certain length, and that length is always twice some integer n. So if n is, say, 3, the period is 2 times 3, which is 6. Okay, so a block of 6 digits made of zeros and ones, that just repeats over and over. Like 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, and 0. Precisely. That block of 2n elements is the fundamental period. All right, now the crucial part. What makes one of these sequences even? It's not like the number 4 is even, right? Yay, no, not quite like that. It's about the contents of one period. An even sequence is one where, within that single repeating block of 2n elements, there's an even number of ones. So an even number of ones, zero, hmm. Okay, and because the total length of the period, 2n, is always an even number, well, if you have an even number of ones, you have to have an even number of zeros, too. Ah, okay, so it's balanced in terms of parity. Even ones, even zeros. Like if the period was 4, so n2, then 1100 works. Two ones, two zeros. Exactly, that's an even sequence. But something like 1,000 wouldn't be because it has 1, 1, and 3 zeros. Odd counts. Correct, that fails the even test. Now, there's another layer here mentioned in the OEIS, this idea of equivalence. Sequences being the same if you can translate them or swap the ones and oos. Yes, this is key to understanding what A00028 actually counts. We're not counting every single sequence that fits the criteria. Right, so what does translation mean here? Think of it like a cyclical shift. Imagine your sequence is written in a circle. If you have 0, 0, 0, 11, shifting it one step gives 1, 1, 1. Shift again, 11, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0. Precisely, that block of 2n elements is the fundamental period. All right, now the crucial part. What makes one of these sequences even? It's not like the number 4 is even, right? Yay, no, not quite like that. It's about the contents of one period.
