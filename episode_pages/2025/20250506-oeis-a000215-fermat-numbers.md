## Description

An accessible tour of Fermat numbers F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 (A000215): from Fermatâ€™s prime guesses to Eulerâ€™s disproof with F5 = 4294967297 = 641 Ã— 6700417. We discuss why any prime factor must satisfy special congruence conditions, the pairwise coprimality of Fermat numbers, and the big open questions about infinitely many Fermat primes and related arithmetic curiosities.

## Transcript

Welcome to this deep dive. As part of our ongoing series for number theory students exploring the OEIS, today we're tackling sequence A00215. Ah yes, the Fermat numbers. Exactly. Defined by that, well, really elegant formula 2^10 + 11, they're a fantastic way into some really deep number theory ideas, I think. They really are. It looks so simple, 2^10 + 11, but the amount of mathematics it's generated is quite remarkable, still fascinating. Right. So the first few are 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537. And looking at those, Pierre de Fermat back in the 17th century, he guessed, didn't he? He conjectured that all numbers from this formula would be prime. A very natural conjecture to make, seeing that sequence, 3, 5, 17, they're all prime. Seemed like a solid pattern. But as we'll get into, the story isn't quite that straightforward. Not at all. And to help us unpack all of this, we're very fortunate to have a Fields Medal winning mathematician with us today. Welcome. It's a real pleasure to be here. Fermat numbers, they're just a classic example, really. How simple formulas can lead you down some very, very deep and tricky paths. Okay, so let's maybe start with some of the basics. The patterns within the numbers themselves, there are these recursive definitions, aren't there? Yes, several interesting ones. They give different perspectives on how the numbers grow. Like Fn-1, 1, 12 plus 11, 1. That's for 1-1. That's 1, yes. It shows how each one sort of squares up from the previous one, roughly speaking. Then there's 101 times F1 times dots times M1 plus 22, also for 1-1. Ah, that one really, it connects each number to all the ones before it. It does, and it's incredibly useful. It highlights the structure. And there are others too. I think I saw 101 plus 201, two dots, 002. That's another one, yes. And if 101, M1, 2 for 101, 2, they all reveal different aspects of this internal structure and just how fast these numbers grow. That rapid growth, it leads to something quite striking about their factors, doesn't it? Goldbach's theorem. Not the conjecture everyone knows, but a different one. Right, related to Christian Goldbach. It states that any two distinct Fermat numbers are co-prime. They don't share any common factor greater than one. Okay, so how does that work? Well, it hinges beautifully on that second recurrence relation we mentioned. 5Nya, C dots, 5N1 plus 22. Suppose you have two Fermat numbers, 5i and 5j, with ijj. And let's assume they share a common factor, call it A, where ijj1. So A divides 5 dollars. Now look at the formula for 5 dollars. Since ijj, so follow the terms in that product, co dots, fj1. So A must also divide that whole product. Right, because it divides one of the factors. Exactly. But then A must also divide the difference between 5 dollars and the ad product. And what's the difference? Just 2. From the formula. Just 2. So A must divide 2. But all Fermat numbers, 5i for $1, are odd. 2 dollars is always even, so adding 1 makes it odd. Ah, so A can't be 2. And it has to be greater than 1. And it has to be odd because it divides an odd Fermat number. So it can't divide 2. That's the contradiction. It must be pairwise co-prime. That's very elegant. And this co-prime property, it has that amazing consequence, doesn't it? Another proof for the infinitude of primes. It does, yes. It's a lovely argument. Just pick one prime factor, say pd dollars, for each Fermat number for quarters. Since all the pb dollars are pairwise co-prime, all these chosen prime factors, p dollars, p1, p2, dots, must be distinct. So you have an infinite sequence of distinct prime numbers right there. Precisely. A beautiful connection. Are there other sort of basic properties? I remember reading something about the last digit. Ah, yes. A small curiosity. If you look at the decimal representations, apart from fd dollars and 3, 3 and 5, every other Fermat number, 4 rolls for n dollars, 1, 0 ends in the digit 7. Really? Why 7? It comes down to the powers of 2 modulo 10. The exponents 2n dollars for 1 dollars, quarter was multiples of 4, 2, 2 dollars, 2, 9, 3, 3, so 16, 16 dollars. And 2 dollars raised to a power that's a multiple of 4 always ends in the digit 6, like 24, 16, 28, 2356, 18, etc. So 2 ends in 6 for the 1. Ah, and 6 dollars plus 1 equals 17. Okay, that makes sense. A neat little pattern. And there's one more property worth mentioning. Perhaps Solomon Galam showed in 1963 that the sum of the reciprocals, 1f dollars plus 1f1 plus 1f2 plus dots, adds up to an irrational number. So not a simple fraction. Interesting. It connects them to, well, a different class of numbers entirely. It does. It just hints at the depth hidden in this sequence. Okay, some really nice structural properties. But the main event, historically speaking, is really about their primality, isn't it? Fermat's original idea. Absolutely. That's where the main story unfolds. And Fermat was right about the first few. F3, F155, 2277, then F3, 2577, and 46553, 76. These five are indeed prime numbers. We call them Fermat primes. And famously, these are the only ones we know, right? That is correct. Still, after nearly 400 years, those are the only confirmed Fermat primes. Fermat himself believed the pattern continued. But it didn't. No. The very next one, 5, 5, Y, turned out to be composite. It was Leonhard Euler in 1732 who showed this. Euler again. And he found the factor, didn't he? 641. Yes. He calculated 5 dollars, which is 2 to the 1, or 4 billion, 294 million, 967 thousand, 297. And he found it equals 641, 4770. That must have been quite a shock, overturning Fermat's conjecture like that. It shows you can't just rely on the first few terms of a sequence. A classic lesson in mathematics. And Euler did more than just factor 5, 5 dollars. He proved a crucial theorem about the form of any potential prime factor of Fermat number 4 dollars, 22. Oh, what kind of form? He showed any prime factor must be of the form 2l plus 1 plus dollars for some integer k. This was later improved slightly by Lucas to k out to 2n plus 2 plus dollars. So for 5 dollars, the factors must be of the form 2n plus plus dollars plus 2 plus dollars, which is 5 dollars, 2 plus 7, 1, which is 128 plus 11. 1 plus 2 equals 5 dollars plus 2 plus dollars number, or k out 128 plus 1 is, yeah. Let's check 641. Is it like that? 641 modulos is 5 times 128 plus with a lower... Yes, it is. 25 dollars. That's amazing. It really restricts the search. It does significantly. It tells you not just any prime could be a factor. Can we see quickly why 641 divides 5 dollars? I know modular arithmetic is involved. Yes, it's a rather neat argument. The trick is to notice two things about 641. First, 641, 2 equals 5 times 27 plus 1 point. And second, 641, 2 plus 24, 2. From the first equation, 5 dollars times 27 equiv m1, p1, and 641. Right, just rearranging. Now raise both sides to the fourth power. You get 5 dollars times 27, 4, p1, and 641. So 54 dollars times 2, 1, p1. Okay, following so far. Now use the second equation. 641 dollars plus 24 dollars. This means 54 dollars and 24 dollars. This means 54 dollars equiv 1, p1, 641. Ah, substitute that in. Exactly. Substitute 244 dollars for 544 dollars in the congruence we just got. So 24 dollars does 2 equiv. Which is 291 p1. 4, 200 dollars, 41. And 5, 5 is 2 plus 11. So 5, 5 dollars for p1, p4, 20. Precisely. It shows 641 must be a factor. It's elegant. It really is. Okay, so Euler blew Fermat's original idea out of the water with 5, 4 dollars. What are the big questions now? What don't we know? Oh, several fundamental ones remain wide open. Maybe the biggest is, is it open to composite for all 1
