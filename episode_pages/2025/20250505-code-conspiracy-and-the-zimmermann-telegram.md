## Description

A deep dive into the 1917 Zimmermann telegram: how a secret German proposal to Mexico, intercepted and decoded by Britain, helped pull the United States into World War I. We'll unpack the prewar tensions, the daring routes and codes, the key players, and the lasting impact on history.

## Transcript

Okay, get this. World War I is just ripping through Europe, right? The US is desperately trying to stay out of it. Neutrality. Exactly. And then, bam, this secret message pops up. Seriously, like something from a spy movie. It really does sound like fiction, doesn't it? Totally. And it's aimed right at, well, at us. Yeah. At the US. So this time, we're diving deep into historical timelines in encyclopedic info. Basically trying to unpack this wild true story. The Zimmerman Telegram. That's the one. And it was, I mean, fundamentally, it was this coded message sent January 1917. Germany proposing this, well, radical alliance with Mexico. Radical is putting it mildly if the US jumps into the war. Then Mexico should join Germany, attack the US, and Germany would help them get back Texas, Arizona, New Mexico. Just like that. Unbelievable. So our mission today for you listening is to sort of break down the key events, figure out the why behind it all. And really understand the consequences. Why this one telegram became so incredibly significant. Why are we still talking about it? Let's figure that out. Okay, so before this telegram bombshell hits, what's the vibe? Germany, Mexico, the US. Things were already a bit tense, weren't they? Not exactly smooth sailing. Oh, definitely not. There's a history there, well before 1917. You had German activity in Mexico going back years. Remember the Ipiranga incident in 1914? Germans caught shipping arms. Right, I remember reading about that. And that same year, President Wilson sends US troops into Veracruz, trying to influence things. Which didn't exactly make Mexico eager to side with the US later, I imagine. Well, it certainly complicated things. That intervention plus some later peace talks involving South American nations probably pushed Mexico more towards neutrality, actually. They were wary of, you know, more US interference. And it wasn't just guns, was it? Germany was actively trying to stir the pot. Oh, absolutely. In 1915, you have this German agent, Francois Rintelin, naval intelligence sends him over. And he gives the Mexican president at the time, Huerta, something like $12 million. Huge sum back then. $12 million. Just to start a war with the US. Pretty much. To try and ignite a conflict, keep the US busy. Then, fast forward to July 1916, the Black Tom explosion. New Jersey, massive sabotage. I've heard of that, sabotage, right? Widely suspected to be German work, possibly linked to an agent, Lothar Witzke, operating out of Mexico City. So yeah, they were definitely pushing boundaries. Sounds like Germany was really desperate to distract the US. How was Mexico reacting? Was President Carranza tempted by any of this German attention? Well, Carranza, who was president by then, he did seem somewhat pro-German, especially after the whole US chase for Pancho Villa fizzled out in 1916. Maybe made the US look a bit less intimidating. But, and this is a big but, Carranza should have seen a red flag in June 1916. Germany basically told him, sorry, we can't even stump up the gold you need for a national bank. So big promises, but maybe not much cash to back him up. Exactly. It hinted they couldn't really deliver. Still, those earlier efforts, plus the US looking maybe a bit ineffective after the Villa thing, it probably made Germany think, okay, maybe this big telegram idea, maybe it'll work. Okay, so the stage is set. Now, the telegram itself, this famous message, when did it actually go out? And who was supposed to get it? Right, so it was sent January 17th, 1917. Arthur Zimmerman, he was Germany's foreign secretary, sends it to their ambassador down in Mexico City, Heinrich von Eckert. And crucially, the British knew. Almost immediately. British intelligence intercepted it pretty much straight away. The Germans had no idea. And the way it was sent, that's almost as wild as the message itself, isn't it? The routes it took were just... Wow. They really were. See, the British had cut Germany's direct undersea cables early in the war. Standard practice. So Germany had to get creative. Very creative. One main route was radio, through a German-owned telefunken plant in New York. In New York. Yep. And get this, because of the war situation, the plant was actually being operated by the US Navy on behalf of the American subsidiary. You're kidding. So the US Navy was unknowingly helping transmit a plot against itself. Basically, yeah. The irony is incredible. It also went via diplomatic cables of neutral countries. The US, again, and Sweden. How did that work? Yeah. Through US cables. Yes. Some routes involved US diplomatic lines. The Swedish route, for example, went via British cables from Stockholm to Buenos Aires, then used an American company's network to get to Mexico. It was complex. Just staggering. Using American lines. And I read somewhere that the US initially said messages had to be in plain text, no codes. How did Zimmerman get around that? That was the rule at first, yeah. Clear text only. But it got relaxed. And literally the day before Zimmerman sent his telegram, January 16th, the US ambassador in Berlin, James Cherar, actually accepted a note from Zimmerman asking permission to send messages in code to keep diplomatic channels open, you know? Oh, wow. So perfect timing for Zimmerman. Unwittingly perfect timing. It created the loophole he needed. So the Germans sent it off thinking it's all secret and secure. But then there's Room 40. Tell us about them. Sounds very hush-hush. Room 40. Yeah, that was the British Admiralty's top secret code-breaking department. Absolutely vital during the war. Like something out of, well, a spy novel, as you said. So who were the key players there cracking this specific message? For the Zimmerman telegram, you're looking at Nigel de Grey. He got a partial decode pretty quickly, around January 18th. And William Montgomery worked with him to finish it off by mid-February. Okay. And the big boss overseeing it all was Admiral Sir Reginald Hall, Blinker Hall, head of Room 40. These guys were the best minds Britain had, working in total secrecy, cracking codes gave them a huge advantage. How did they manage it, though? German codes must have been tough. Did they just get lucky? Well, there was a bit of luck, actually, combined with skill. Earlier in the war, there was this failed German expedition to Afghanistan, the Niedermeyer-Hentig expedition. Okay. One of the German agents involved, Wilhelm Vossmus, basically the German Lawrence of Arabia, had to abandon his luggage, including a German codebook. The Allies recovered it. Ah, a captured codebook. That's a game-changer. It certainly helped. Plus, the specific code used for the Zimmerman telegram, diplomatic code, what, year 40, wasn't brand new. They'd been using it for years. So Room 40 already had some experience with it. Exactly. They'd intercepted lots of messages using 3030, so they'd already done a lot of painstaking work figuring parts of it out. They weren't starting completely cold. They also had other codes, like 3512, though maybe not directly useful for this one. And there's even a story they got a copy of the coded text from the telegraph office in Mexico itself, maybe through an agent, this mysterious Mr. H. That would have definitely helped confirm things. Okay, so the British cracked the code. Yeah. They have this message. What exactly did it say? What was the offer to Mexico, point by point? Right. The contents were, well, explosive. First off, it stated Germany was resuming unrestricted submarine warfare on February 1st. Full stop. Which they knew would likely bring the U.S. in. They absolutely anticipated that. So the core offer was, let's make a military alliance, Germany and Mexico. We fight together. We make peace together. And the reward for Mexico? Germany offers substantial financial support and, crucially, backs Mexico in reconquering its lost territory, namely Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Wow. Just offering up huge chunks of the U.S. Exactly. The instructions to the ambassador were clear. Approach the Mexican president, but only in secret, and only once war with the U.S. looked certain. Any other parts to the plan? Yeah, it also suggested Mexico should try and get Japan on board. Invite Japan into this new alliance against the U.S., and even offer to mediate between Germany and Japan. Okay, ambitious. And finally, Zimmerman added this bit about how they expected their U-boats, their submarines, to force Britain to sue for peace within months. That was the German thinking at the time. The sheer audacity. Offering another country parts of its neighbor. It wasn't just strategy. It felt like a direct slap in the face to the U.S., didn't it? Absolutely. For a country already angry about submarine attacks, this was adding serious insult to injury. A real sense of betrayal. So the Brits have this. Admiral Hall in Room 40. What's their first reaction? They must know how huge this is. Oh, they knew. But Hall, he was hesitant. Really reluctant at first to release it. Why? It seems like the perfect weapon against Germany. Because revealing it meant admitting two massive secrets. One, that they'd broken top-level German diplomatic codes. Right, you don't want the enemy knowing that. Exactly. And two, it would reveal they were eavesdropping on neutral countries' communications, including the U.S. diplomatic traffic used to
