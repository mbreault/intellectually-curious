## Transcript

Welcome to our deep dive, everybody. Today, it's all about the history of Microsoft Flight Simulator. Oh, yeah, Flight Simulator, a classic. We're gonna use some excerpts from Wikipedia to go through it all, but honestly, this story is surprisingly fascinating. I mean, it spanned decades, right? It kind of reflects how both personal computers and gaming have changed over time. Exactly, and by the time we're done, you'll see this whole franchise in a different light, promise. I think people will be surprised, for sure. Flight Simulator is way more than just a game. Right, it shows how technology has advanced, how dedicated its community is. Yeah, and it lets people experience the wonder of flight, you know, without leaving their chair. Okay, so let's set our course for the past and rewind all the way back to the mid-1970s. Whoa, way back. Before IDM PCs were even a thing. Really? Yeah. It all starts with this guy, Bruce Artwick, the true pioneer in computer graphics. Okay. He was writing these articles about 3D graphics, specifically for flight simulation. Huh, interesting. And these weren't just like basic guides either. He was getting into some really complex theoretical stuff. So he was basically asking, like, what if we could make flying feel real using computers? Yeah, pretty much. And that sparked something amazing. What's really cool is the people who read his articles, they didn't just think they were neat. No. They wanted in. They were contacting the magazine, asking to buy this flight simulator software, even though it didn't really exist yet. Wow, that's wild. So like he created a demand without even meaning to. Exactly. Sometimes the best ideas kind of create their own market. People didn't even know they wanted this until Artwick showed them. That's a good point. So with all this unexpected demand, Artwick starts the Sublogic Corporation in 1977. Okay. And get this, they were selling these early flight simulators through mail order. Really? No app stores or anything? Nope, just floppy disks showing up in your mailbox. That's crazy to think about. And these first versions, they were running on platforms most people haven't even heard of today. The 8080, the Altair 8800. Oh wow, those are some like real vintage computers. Right, these are the pioneers of personal computing. And Flight Simulator was right there at the forefront. It's almost like the software was a test to see how powerful these new computers actually were. Huh, that makes sense. Then in 1979, things shift a bit when Flight Simulator is released for the Apple II. Ah, the Apple II, now that's one I know. Right, that opened it up to way more people. It really planted the seed for what it would become. Definitely. The Apple II helped make personal computers something everyone could have so more people got exposed to Flight Simulator. For sure. Then in 1982, Microsoft comes into the picture. They see the potential in this software, you know. Yeah, they were smart to pick it up. So they licensed Flight Simulator for the IBM PC, which was quickly becoming the standard computer. I mean, that partnership makes sense. Microsoft had the platform, they knew how to market things, and Artwick had this amazing, innovative software. Perfect match. And here's a little fun fact. In those early days, Flight Simulator was used as a kind of unofficial test for new PCs. Like, would it run on this new machine or not? Oh, really? Yeah. Along with Lotus 1-2-3, which was this super popular spreadsheet software. If your PC could run those, it was a solid machine. So even back then, Flight Simulator was pushing the limits of what computers could do? Totally. And it just kept pushing those boundaries, you know, with every new version they released. In 84, Flight Simulator 2.0 came out. It was a big leap because they expanded the scenery to cover the entire United States. Wow, the whole country? The whole US. And they added support for joysticks and mice. Oh, right. So that's when it started feeling more like you were actually controlling the plane. Exactly. Those might seem like small additions now, but they made a huge difference back then. Yeah, I bet. And Flight Simulator kept evolving, right? Oh, absolutely. It was like it was growing alongside the computers themselves. As the computers got more powerful, Flight Simulator used that power to become more realistic, more detailed, and add more features. I can see how people would get hooked on that. It was always getting better. Right. Like with Flight Simulator 3.0 in 88, more aircraft, more airports. But the real change was, you could finally see your plane from the outside. Oh, wow. So you weren't just stuck in the cockpit anymore? Nope. It was a huge step toward making it look more realistic. You could actually appreciate the three-dimensional nature of it all. It set the stage for even better graphics down the line. Cool. But before we get too far ahead, wasn't there another important change that happened around then? Oh, yeah. Flight Simulator 4.0 in 1989, it brought in dynamic scenery. So for the first time, you had moving traffic both on the ground and in the air. That's huge. I must have felt so much more real with other things happening around you. It did. And let's not forget, they also added the option to design your own aircraft. Really? So people could build their own planes in the game? Yep. And that's become a big part of what makes Flight Simulator so appealing, being able to customize it, tinker with it, make it your own. Yeah, I can see that. That's way ahead of its time, especially with all the modding communities we see in games now. But there was something else that happened in the early 90s, right? Something about textures. Oh, man. Textures. Flight Simulator 5.0 in 93, it was a complete game changer. What was so different about it? No more flat, boring landscapes. They added textures. Everything suddenly looked so much more real. It's hard to describe how big of a difference it made. It must have been mind-blowing at the time. Oh, it was. Flight Simulator was often at the forefront of pushing those graphics boundaries. And Flight Simulator 5.0 did something else that was really smart. They introduced the BGL scenery format, which, believe it or not, they still use today. Wow, they were thinking ahead. Seriously. They created a system that was flexible enough to last for decades. And they didn't stop there. In 95, Flight Simulator 5.1 came out, and it kept pushing the visual realism further. They added scenery libraries, satellite imagery, and a whole bunch of weather effects. Storms, 3D clouds, fog. The virtual skies were getting serious. You know, it's interesting to think about how that changed the whole experience. Before, it was mostly about, you know, learning how to fly the plane. But with those visual improvements, it became more about experiencing the world, feeling how dynamic everything was. That's a really good point. It shifted from just simulation to something more like virtual exploring. You weren't just flying. You were immersed in this dynamic world. Right. And then Windows came along, right? So did Flight Simulator change with it? Oh, yeah. In 1996, they released Flight Simulator for Windows 95, which made everything run smoother, improved the haze effects, and even added the extra 300 aerobatic aircraft. So now you had even more options for flying. It's amazing how far it had come in, what, like 15 years? From those mail-order floppy disks to a full-blown Windows application. Crazy, right? And the innovation just kept going. Flight Simulator 98 added a helicopter, the Bell 206B3 Jet Ranger. That was a big deal because it opened up a whole new way to fly. It's cool how they weren't content to just, like, stick with what they had. They always wanted to add something new to challenge people to learn new things. Absolutely. And they were always pushing the technical limits. Flight Simulator 98 also had a better interface, and for the first time, it supported 3D graphics cards through DirectX. DirectX. I've heard of that, but I don't really know what it is. It's basically a set of tools that lets games talk to your computer's hardware better, especially the graphics card. So you get smoother visuals, better performance, and a more enjoyable experience overall. Ah, okay. So Flight Simulator was using some pretty advanced tech even back then. Oh, for sure. And speaking of advanced, Flight Simulator 2000 came out in 1999, and man, they went all out. 3D elevation, a GPS system, even more detailed scenery, and the Concorde. Whoa, the Concorde, the supersonic jet. The one and only. This era was just incredible for Flight Simulator. Every new version felt like a giant leap forward. This feels like a good place to pause for now. We've covered a lot, but the story of Flight Simulator doesn't end here. Oh, I know. There's so much more to come. I can't wait to dive into the next chapter. All right, we're back, ready to continue our flight through Microsoft Flight Simulator history. You bet. We left off just as things were really heating up. Right, like we were talking about how each new version felt like a massive leap forward. Yeah, yeah. And Flight Simulator 2002 definitely kept that trend going. Oh, absolutely. That one came out in 2001, and it brought out some features that, honestly, we take for granted in flight sims today. You
