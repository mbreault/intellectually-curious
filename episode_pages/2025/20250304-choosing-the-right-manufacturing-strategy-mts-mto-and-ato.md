## Description

In this episode of Deep Dive, we break down the three core manufacturing strategiesâ€”Make to Stock (MTS), Make to Order (MTO), and Assemble to Order (ATO). We define each approach, examine their strengths and weaknesses, and connect them to real-world demand patterns, push vs. pull dynamics, and key business considerations like capacity, capital investment, and lead times. Youâ€™ll leave with a practical framework for selecting the right strategy for your product, market, and operational strengthsâ€”and concrete examples you can apply today.

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. Today, we're diving into something really critical for any supply chain professional. Oh, yeah. Definitely a big one. Choosing the right manufacturing strategy. Right. You know, our listeners have shared some great resources on make to stock MTS, make to order MTO, and assemble to order ATO. We're going to unpack all of those approaches. Absolutely. But what we're really going to focus on today is how to choose the one that's right for you. Yeah. I think what's really interesting here is that each one of these strategies is kind of like a different philosophy. You know, it's a different way of thinking about how you manage your demand, how you manage your inventory, what your customers expect. So we're going to look at each one. We'll look at the strengths and weaknesses. Right. We'll get into why choosing the right one can have a huge impact on your company's bottom line. Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's definitely not just some, you know, theoretical exercise. This has real world implications. Yeah. But before we get into all the details. Right. Let's start with the basics. Can you just give us like a clear definition of what each one of these is? Like what is MTS? What is MTO and what is ATO? Absolutely. So let's break them down one by one. So make to stock or MTS is your classic mass production model. You know, think about it as you're trying to anticipate what customers are going to want. OK. You forecast demand. You produce those goods ahead of time and you're storing them. You have them ready to go. So they're ready to be shipped out as soon as that order comes in. Right. Good examples would be kind of like everyday consumer goods like, you know, your shampoos or your snacks or, you know, those bulk packs of, you know, pens and pencils we see in like office supply stores. Those are products where demand is generally stable and predictable. OK, that makes sense. So MTS is all about efficiency, having product ready to go. So what about make to order then? So make to order or MTO really flips that script. Here, production doesn't even begin until that customer order is in hand. It's all about customization. It's about being really responsive to those specific needs. Imagine if you were building a house or a car. Right. Every order is unique. It's tailored to exactly what they want. That's MTO. So if MTS is about anticipating demand, then MTO is about reacting to demand. Absolutely. So it seems like with MTO, there's less risk of ending up with like a bunch of, you know, unwanted inventory. You're exactly right. It minimizes that risk, but it often comes with higher production costs. Sure. And also longer lead times because you're not drawing from pre-made stock. So there is a trade-off there. Yeah, that makes sense. So where does assemble to order fit into all of this? So assemble to order or ATO is really a cool hybrid approach. It tries to kind of strike a balance between that efficiency of MTS and that flexibility of MTO. Think of it as a middle ground. So you pre-manufacture sub-assemblies in advance. You hold those in inventory. And then when a customer order comes in, you assemble the final product according to what they choose. Okay. I'm starting to see how this is kind of a blend of the two approaches. But can you give me like a real-world example? Like how does this actually play out? Sure. So a perfect example and something I think many of your listeners will be familiar with is like a personal computer distributor. Okay. Yeah. They'll typically have like pre-made components, you know, motherboards, hard drives, RAM. Right. But the final configuration, you know how much memory, the type of graphics card, that's all assembled after the customer chooses what they want. Okay. That's a great example. I see how that lets them offer some customization. Right. Without having to literally build every single PC. Yeah. You know, like totally from scratch. Exactly. So, okay, we've got MPS focusing on efficiency. MTO is all about flexibility. Yep. And then ATO is trying to find that kind of sweet spot in between. Yeah. But how do all of these strategies connect to that like bigger idea of push versus pull manufacturing? I hear those terms a lot. That's a great question. And it's a really important distinction. So MTS is a classic example of a push strategy. You're pushing products out into the market based on what you anticipate that demand is going to be. You know, it's like a bakery making dozens of loaves of bread first thing in the morning. And then they push them out onto the shelves, hoping that customers will buy them. So in that bakery analogy, MTO would be like taking custom cake orders. Exactly. You only bake what is specifically requested. Demand pulls production. You only make what's been ordered. Think of it like a made to measure tailoring service. Okay. You wouldn't start cutting fabric and sewing until you have that client's measurements. Right, right. ATO, on the other hand, is kind of like a restaurant that has like a fixed menu. Okay. But they also have a specials board that changes based on, you know, ingredients they have and what people seem to be asking for. I like that. So they have their standard dishes ready to go, but they offer some flexibility and customization. So it blends push and pull. And that gives it a unique advantage. Yeah, I love those analogies. Those are really good. It really clarifies it for me. But with all these different approaches, how do you actually choose the right one? Like what are some of the things that companies need to think about? I think one of the most critical factors is understanding your demand patterns. There's a source we both looked at. It's called Supply Chain Strategies for Variable Demand, and it outlines five distinct demand patterns. Okay. And it kind of gives you a framework for deciding which manufacturing strategy is the most suitable for each one. So let's take a look at those patterns. Okay, let's do it. All right. The first demand pattern is what they call turn volume. This is where you have stable and predictable demand for a product. A lot like those classroom consumables we talked about earlier, like pens and pencils, notebooks. MTS is a natural fit for that kind of situation because it's all about maximizing efficiency and keeping those inventory costs low. Yeah, it's like that steady drumbeat of orders. You can pretty much set your watch to it. Exactly. Then you have short cycles. These are products with highly unpredictable demand, maybe because they're new or innovative or they're samples or pilot products. Forecasting is really tough in those situations. So the flexibility and responsiveness of MTO really shine there. You're not making anything until you have that confirmed order. So it's about minimizing risk in situations where you just you can't really get a good read on what the demand is going to be. Precisely. Now think about seasonal demand patterns. This is where you have those predictable peaks and valleys throughout the year, back to school supplies, holiday decorations, even certain types of clothing. It requires a little bit more finesse. You might use MTS, but you need to carefully plan production and potentially build up inventory ahead of those peak seasons to make sure you can meet that surge in demand. So you're trying to strike that balance between having enough product on hand without getting stuck with a warehouse full of unsold goods after the season ends. Sounds like accurate forecasting is really key there. Absolutely. Then you have product launches, which are always a bit of a wild card. With a new product, you're never quite sure how the market is going to respond. Agility is paramount there. So being able to quickly adapt to those early sales signals is really essential. You might use MTO initially to gauge demand and then transition to MTS or ATO once you have a better sense of what the market really wants. So it's like dipping your toe in the water before you like dive headfirst. Exactly. And finally, you have intermittent demand patterns. So demand is sporadic, but there's usually some degree of predictability. A hybrid approach like MTO or configure to order, often backed by some sophisticated forecasting techniques, works well there. Think of specialized durables or industrial equipment that's only purchased when there's a specific need. Okay. So it sounds like matching your manufacturing strategy to your demand patterns is really like the cornerstone of making the right decision. It's one of the most important factors for sure. But remember, it's not the only piece of the puzzle. There are other things to consider, like your production capacity, how much capital investment you're willing to make, and of course, what your customers expect in terms of lead times and customization options. Let's dive into those a little bit further. Okay, let's talk about capacity then. How does that influence the choice between MTS, MTO, and ATO? Well, if you have a high volume production facility that's really geared towards efficiency, MTS might be the most logical choice. You know, you can crank out those standardized products at scale. But if your strength is in customization and flexibility, then MTO might be a better fit, even if it means lower production volumes. ATO, as you can imagine, requires a bit of both. You need to be able to efficiently produce those sub-assemblies while also having the systems in place to handle final assembly based on customer specifications. So it's about aligning your manufacturing strategy with your operational strengths. Exactly. And then there's the question of capital investment. MTS often requires a significant upfront investment in inventory. You're essentially fronting the cost of those goods before you even know for sure if they'll sell. MTO, on the other hand, has less upfront inventory risk. But you might need to invest in more flexible production equipment and
