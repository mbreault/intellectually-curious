## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive, where we explore fascinating corners of mathematics. Today, continuing our journey through the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, the OEIS, we're setting our sights on a sequence with a, well, a rather evocative name, 000183, the Discordant Permutations. Indeed. Discordant Permutations. It was previously catalogued as M2121N0838. It offers us a glimpse into the subtle world of combinatorial arrangements. The initial terms, you know, 00012344, they already kind of hint at a structure that's, well, more intricate than it might initially appear. Right. So our goal today is to really understand what makes a permutation discordant in this specific sense and maybe uncover some of the interesting places this concept leads us within combinatorics. Okay, so a permutation, as we know, is just a rearrangement of elements. If we're talking about a set of n numbers, say 1 through n, a permutation is one specific order they can be written in. Now, what twists things? Makes it discordant. Well, a discordant permutation of length as defined for A000183 is one where none of the numbers appear in their original position. Think of it like this. If we start with 1, 2, 3, a discordant permutation would be something like 2, 3, 1. See, 1 isn't first, 2 isn't second, 3 isn't third. Uh-huh. But 1, 3, 2 wouldn't be discordant because the 1 is still in its original first position. Got it. Fixed points are forbidden. Exactly. So at its heart, the study of discordant permutations is about understanding permutations when fixed points are forbidden. It's a fundamental constraint that, you know, pops up surprisingly often. This is directly linked to the classic idea of a derangement, which is exactly a permutation with no fixed points. The probl√®me des rencontres, a classic puzzle. Mismatched letters and envelopes. Oh, wait. That's essentially asking for the number of derangements. Berman and Fryer's work from 72 goes into more detail on derangements if you want to dive deeper there. That makes perfect sense. It's about everything being displaced. Now, the OEIS description also mentions... The scenario with diners, yes, around a circular table. Right, that sounds like it adds another layer of complexity. It does, yeah. The combinatorial interpretation given in the OEIS presents A, N as the number of ways to reseat N diners at a circular table, such that no one ends up in their original seat or in a seat immediately adjacent to their original one. Oh, okay. So not just not in your original seat, but also not next to it either. Exactly. That additional restriction, not being next to where you started, distinguishes this specific type of discordance from a simple linear derangement. The circular arrangement introduces neighbors, making the conditions more stringent. So those initial zeros in the sequence for N1, 2, and 3, those probably make sense under this circular table rule, right? Precisely. Yeah, think about it. One diner, any other seat is still adjacent. Two diners, if they swap, they're now next to where they began. And for three diners, well, if one moves one seat over, they'll be next to their original spot, left or right. It's not until we have at least four diners that it actually becomes possible for everyone to move so they're neither in their original chair nor a neighboring one. That clarifies the start of the sequence nicely. Now, for N5, the sequence gives away A5 equals 2. An example. Original 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 leads to 3, 4, 5, 1, 2 and 4, 5, 1, 2, 3. Looking at those, it's not immediately obvious why only those two work under the circular condition. You're right. It requires a bit of careful checking. Take 3, 4, 5, 1, 2. If we look at the original positions, 1 has moved two places, right? So if 2, 3, 4, and 5 all shifted two places cyclically, so no one's in their original spot or next to it, and the same logic holds for 4, 5, 1, 2, 3. Everyone shifted by two again, just the other way. Okay. If you try to construct other permutations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, satisfying this no original seat, no neighbor rule, you'll pretty quickly see why there are only these two. It highlights that even for small numbers, these constrained counting problems can get quite subtle. It certainly underscores that this isn't just a trivial counting exercise. Now, I recall seeing a mention of concordant and discordant pairs in statistics. Is that related? It uses the word discordant, which, yeah, might suggest a link, but it's actually a different concept. In statistics, when you analyze pairs of data points for two variables, a discordant pair means the relative order of values in one pair is opposite to the relative order in another. Like if person A is taller and heavier than B, but person C is shorter but heavier than D, that involves a discordance between height and weight. Right, I see. So if we viewed a permutation as pairs, i.e., a discordant pair of permutations in that statistical sense would involve elements changing relative order between them. It's about the relationship between permutations, not the internal property of one permutation relative to its start, which is our focus with A000183. Good distinction. So same word, different mathematical job. Exactly. It's a good reminder, you know? That's an important distinction to make. Thanks for clarifying. The outline also mentions the probl√®me de m√©nage, the married couples problem. That sounds like a classic headache of a combinatorial problem. It is indeed a classic. And yes, a headache sometimes. The m√©nage problem asks for the number of ways to seat married couples around a circular table, such that men and women alternate, and crucially, no one sits next to their spouse. Oh boy. Yeah. The elegant solutions pioneered by folks like Lesanne Moreau-Taylor, they crucially rely on the concept of discordant permutations, specifically in that circular arrangement context with forbidden adjacencies, the no spouse sitting next to each other constraint. When you look at it from one gender's perspective relative to the other, it becomes equivalent to finding a permutation where certain neighbors are disallowed. It's a form of discordance. Wow. So this seemingly specific idea of discordant permutations is actually a key ingredient in solving a much more complex and frankly relatable problem like seating arrangements. Exactly. There's even a recurrence relation and a closed form expression, Tushar's formula for the solutions of the m√©nage numbers, n. The first few are 0, 1, 2, 13, 80. That's OEIS A000179 if you're keeping track. A000179, got it. The number of valid seatings for the couples is directly tied to these m√©nage numbers, which are built on these principles of circular discordant permutations. It's really remarkable how these abstract objects have such concrete applications, even indirectly. Now shifting gears slightly, four discordant permutations from Whitehead's work, how does that fit in? Right, so four discordant permutations basically takes the idea of displacement a step further. In a four discordant permutation, one, chi, an element i can't be equal to i, i plus 1, i plus 2, or i plus 3, and those indices are mod n for the circle. So even more restrictions, not just the spot or the neighbors, but the next two spots after that too. Exactly. Not original, not next, not two away, not three away. The permutations in A000183 are less restrictive, just forbidding the original spot and immediate neighbors. By exploring these stricter conditions, like four discordance, we can, you know, uncover even more refined structures within permutations. It sounds like by increasing the discordance level, we're imposing stricter constraints. The abstract mentioned rook polynomials and hit polynomials. Are those the tools for analyzing these? Yes, rook polynomials and hit polynomials are powerful tools here, especially for permutations with restricted positions. Think of a rook polynomial like a generating function. It counts ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board where some squares are forbidden. In the permutation context, the board represents possible positions, i, and forbidden squares are the disallowed placements based on the discordance rule. The hit polynomial is related. Its coefficient of u specifically gives the number of permutations with zero hits, meaning zero elements land in forbidden spots. Yes, so for discordant permutations, we want zero hits according to the rule. Precisely. Whether it's the A000183 rule or the four discordant rule. And there was also mention of a Tribonacci sequence related to four discordant permutations. That's like Fibonacci's cousin. That's correct. Fibonacci is sum of the previous two terms. Tribonacci is sum of the previous three. Yamamoto observed the fascinating thing where Lucas numbers closely related to Fibonacci appear as leading coefficients in rook polynomials for three discordant permutations. Then Whitehead's work showed that for four discordant permutations, circular, the leading coefficients of their rook polynomials form a Tribonacci sequence. Wow, okay. That suggests a really deep connection. It does. A potential structural relationship between the level of discordance and these fundamental recurrent sequences. It hints at underlying patterns as restrictions get more complex. That's a beautiful illustration of how different math areas intertwine. Getting back to our main focus, A000183, does the OEIS give general formulas or recursions for larger n? Those initial terms jump quite
