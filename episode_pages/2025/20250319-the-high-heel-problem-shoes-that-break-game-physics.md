## Description

We unpack the infamous high heel problem in game developmentâ€”how changing a characterâ€™s shoe height cascades into animations, hitboxes, and interactions. From Dragonâ€™s Dogma 2 to IK-based solutions and clever workarounds, we explore techniques, trade-offs, and why this tiny detail matters in modern games.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our series on computer science and software engineering. You know, we like to dig into these surprising challenges that developers face. And today we're tackling one that might raise a few eyebrows. The high heel problem in video game development. Oh yeah, this one's fun. It sounds a little, well, frivolous at first glance, right? Right. But trust me, the technical stuff behind those stylish shoes, it gets really complex. Oh yeah, and it's deep. We're going to be looking at an article by Simon, a game developer. He really breaks down the nuts and bolts of this issue. And just to be clear, strictly from the technical side, no ethical debates here. Yeah, it's a perfect example of how even like a tiny detail can turn into a huge headache for developers. Exactly. So let's break it down. The high heel problem, it's not just about how things look. No. When you change a character's shoe height, even a little bit, it messes with tons of stuff in the game. Animations, interactions, you name it. For sure. Simon talks about how these height differences can cause all sorts of problems. And he uses Dragon's Dogma 2 as like a case study. Yeah, in Dragon's Dogma 2, they have to figure out how to make characters with different heights kiss. Oh, interesting. So they use a bunch of little animation tweaks and some really clever camera work to make sure their lips actually meet, no matter how tall they are. Wow, I never even noticed that while I was playing. It's subtle. But it makes you think about all the other interactions, right? Like, what about something as basic as pushing a button? Well, that's where it gets really tricky. Yeah. If a character's hand is in the wrong place because of their shoes, they might miss the button entirely. Oh, right. Or do something totally weird. And in games where every millisecond counts, you know, competitive games, even a tiny change in height from shoes can mess with their hitboxes. Their hitboxes. Like those invisible shapes that decide if they get hit or run into things. Right. Yeah, so that can be a huge deal. So how do developers even begin to fix this? Simon talks about two main ways they approach it. One is to adjust the character's height itself. Yep, and there are a few ways to do that. Some games, like Infinity Nikki, they just kind of cheat and make the character taller. Okay. And it kind of works because the interactions in that game aren't super precise. But even Infinity Nikki has problems sometimes, you know, like clipping issues during certain animations when the character's wearing heels. Ah, so it's like the hope for the best method? Pretty much, yeah. But what if you need it to be really, really precise? Then it gets way more involved. Developers have to create unique animations for every single shoe height. Oh, wow. And that's a ton of work. Imagine animating like every movement, every interaction, multiple times, just because the shoes are different. Yeah, that sounds like a nightmare. It's super time consuming. Plus, wouldn't that make the game feel kind of inconsistent? Like if different shoes have totally different animations. Oh, totally. Simon brings up GTA Online, and there's this one golf animation that only works if you're wearing flat shoes. Really? Yeah, it just shows how hard it is to keep things consistent when characters could look so different. Okay, so manual adjustment is one way. What's the other option? The other big one is using dynamic systems like IK, inverse kinematics. IK. IK. Yeah, it's basically a way to adjust the position of a character's limbs in real time so the animations are more flexible and look more realistic. Okay, I'm trying to picture this. Think of it like this. IK is what lets a character's feet move naturally on, like, bumpy ground or reach for something realistically. Yeah, I've got it. It adapts. So with IK, the hand positioning problem we talked about could be solved. Exactly. No matter what shoes you're wearing, your hand could reach that button thanks to IK. It can also handle even more complex stuff, like characters holding hands when they're different heights. Oh, wow. IK can make their hand positions look right no matter what. That's pretty amazing. It's powerful, but it's not perfect. Since it relies on, you know, complex calculations happening all the time, it can cause glitches. Or, like, sometimes you get these weird unintended animations, especially in really fast-paced action scenes. So it's a trade-off, like most things. Yeah, definitely. So we talked about adjusting the character's height, which seems like a ton of work. Are there any other ways that developers tackle this problem? Oh, yeah. There are some clever workarounds out there. Instead of actually changing the height, they try to make it look like the shoes are different heights. One trick is to just hide the feet inside the shoe design. Makes the legs look shorter without messing with the character model. Ah, sneaky. Right. Most players wouldn't even notice. What other tricks do they have? Another one is shortening the lower leg mesh of the character model. The mesh? Yeah, it's like the 3D model of the leg. Games like Sims 4, Watch Dogs Legion, and Cyberpunk 2077 use this. Okay. But wouldn't that make the proportions look weird, especially around the ankles? It can, since the ankle stays where it is, shortening the lower leg can make it look kind of distorted, especially when the character's moving. I see. Final Fantasy XIV has this sometimes. Characters in certain high heels, their legs look a little warped. Right, right. It's a tough balance between getting the right height and keeping things looking natural. Nier Automata is interesting, though. They have a character who always wears heels. Oh. Yeah, so since the model was built with heels from the start, the proportions look a lot more normal and you don't get those weird distortions. That's a really clever solution. Yeah, it shows how the character design can actually influence the technical stuff. Totally. Are there any other workarounds that you've come across? Oh, yeah, for sure. Some games, let's just say they get a little creative. Creative how? For instance, 3D Sex Villa 2, they just bend the character's legs during kissing scenes to make their heights match up. They what? It sounds silly. It does. But it actually works surprisingly well and it saves them a ton of animation time. But you gotta do what you gotta do sometimes. Exactly. So, we've been focusing on height, but it's not just about how tall the character is. What about their posture? High heels change how you stand, right? You're absolutely right. High heels change everything. They tilt the pelvis, arch the spine, make the calf muscles work harder. Right, right. It's a whole body transformation. And to make it look real, the character model needs to reflect that. So it's not just about longer legs, it's about those subtle changes and how they hold themselves. Exactly. Simon actually did this experiment where he added these postural details to an existing zombie walking animation. A zombie. Yep, a zombie. And it worked. He gave the zombie the tilted pelvis and arched spine, like someone wearing heels, and it made a huge difference in how realistic it looked. That's amazing. You know, it's those little details that really pull you into a game. For sure. And speaking of details, Simon also pointed out this thing in Cyberpunk 2077 where the foot pose actually changes when you switch between different types of shoes. Seriously? It's tiny, but it shows how much effort they put into making the characters believable. That's impressive. But speaking of believable, what about the animations themselves? I mean, walking in high heels is different, right? So do they make separate walk cycles for characters in heels? Most of the time, no. It's just not practical to create custom walk cycles for every single shoe. Right. So even if your character's rocking stilettos, they're probably using the same walk animation as they would in sneakers. So it's all about creating an illusion that's good enough without getting bogged down in the tiny details. Exactly. There are some exceptions, though. Simon found a Skyrim mod that actually adds unique high-heel animations, and it makes the walk much more exaggerated and stylized. Interesting. But it shows how much work goes into making those custom animations. So it's a lot of effort for a subtle effect. It can be. And the funny thing is, normal walking in high heels isn't as different as people think. Really? Yeah. Everyone walks differently anyway, even in flat shoes. So it's not like everyone suddenly turns into a runway model when they put on heels. That's a good point. So they're trying to find a balance between realism and practicality when it comes to these animations. Exactly. A good example is Infinity Nikki. They don't have separate walk cycles for different shoes, but they do have a bunch of idle poses that change subtly based on the shoes. Okay. It's a simple way to add some variety without going overboard with custom animations. That's smart. But all of these animations, all these detailed models, they must take a toll on the game's performance, especially with those high-polygon shoe designs. Yeah, that's where optimization comes in. It's all about making things run smoothly. So do they just make the high heels lower resolution, like fewer polygons? It's a little more complicated than that. One common trick is to hide the polygons that are covered up by the shoe. Makes sense. If you can't see them, why waste processing power on them? Yeah, it's like a little virtual shoebox hiding all the extra stuff. Exactly. Some games, like Saints Row, they actually build the leg in pieces that can be hidden or
