## Description

In this episode we explore A000225, the sequence 2^n âˆ’ 1. Its binary form is n consecutive 1s, and it appears in many corners of combinatorics and CS. Weâ€™ll see how A000225 counts nonempty subsets of an n-element set, how A_{n+1} counts certain disjoint subset pairs (equivalently, pairs where at least one is empty), and how this ties to Gaussian binomial coefficients at q = 2. Weâ€™ll also connect to Stirling numbers, Pascalâ€™s triangle, and the Tower of Hanoi minimum moves, as well as the length of the longest path in the n-dimensional hypercube. Finally, weâ€™ll place A000225 in the broader family An = A^n âˆ’ 1 for A â‰¥ 2 and discuss what these patterns reveal about how simple formulas reappear across mathematics.

## Transcript

Welcome to this deep dive into, well, a really fascinating corner of mathematics. Today, we're venturing into the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, the OEIS. It's such a vital resource if you're exploring number theory. Think of it maybe as a meticulously curated map of numerical patterns. Our focus today is sequence A000225. Yes, the OEIS. It's truly a remarkable collaborative effort, isn't it? A place where, you know, seemingly disparate mathematical ideas often, well, they converge. And A000225 is a prime example, really. It's a sequence that just pops up in some very surprising places. It really does. So for those of you maybe with the OEIS open, you'll see A000225 is defined by this quite elegant formula, An equals 2n1. That gives us the sequence 0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, and so on. Interestingly, it's also sometimes called Mersenne numbers, though usually that term's more reserved for A000348. So what's the sort of initial spark, the first thing you notice when you look at this sequence? Well, the first thing that strikes you, I think, is the fundamental relationship with powers of 2. Each term is just one less than a power of 2. Second, minus 1. And this simple connection, it unlocks a really powerful visual understanding through binary representation. Ah, yes, the binary connection. Right. Here's where it starts to feel, well, really fundamental. Can you elaborate on that a bit? Absolutely. Take any term in the sequence, say 7. It's 2 cubed minus 1. Now, if you look at its binary form, 111, three 1s, or consider 15. That's 2 to the power of 4 minus 1. Its binary is 1111, four 1s. It's quite a direct mapping. The nth term, An, is simply a number represented by n 1s in binary, which makes it incredibly relevant in computer science where binary is just the bedrock. That's such a clear and immediate link, yeah. Now, looking at the OEIS entry, it reveals the sequence isn't just a binary curiosity. It has some pretty fascinating interpretations in combinatorics, starting with subsets. Yes, that combinatorial interpretation regarding subsets is, well, it's quite beautiful. If you have a set containing, say, n distinct elements, the total number of subsets you can possibly form is 2 to the power of n. Now, if we exclude just one of those subsets, the empty set, the one with nothing in it, we're left with exactly 2n1 non-empty subsets. That's precisely An. Right. So, for example, if you have a set with three elements, ABC, it has 2 cubed, which is 8, total subsets. Remove the empty set, and you're left with 7, and that's a 3. It's a direct consequence of how power sets work. That's a lovely connection. It really is. Then the OEIS introduces another one, maybe a slightly more intricate combinatorial view involving pairs of subsets. This one took me a moment to fully get my head around. It's intriguing. What's intriguing here is the interpretation of An plus 1. It counts the number of pairs of subsets, let's call them X and Y, that you can pick from the power set of a set A that has n elements. But there are two specific conditions. First, X and Y must be disjoint. They can't share any elements. And second, either X has to be a subset of Y or Y has to be a subset of X. Okay. Yeah, that's quite a mouthful. Is there a more maybe intuitive way to picture this? There is, thankfully. The OEIS points out a simpler equivalent condition, which helps a lot. It's the number of pairs, XY, where at least one of X or Y is the empty set. Oh, okay. Let's think about why this works. If one of the sets is the empty set, then they are automatically disjoint, right? And the subset condition is trivially true because the empty set is a subset of everything. So if you have an n-element set, its power set has 2n elements, 2n possible subsets. If we choose the empty set as our first element, X, we have 2n possibilities for the second element, Y. Now, if we pick any of the two un-subsets as the first element, X, we have only one choice for the second element, Y. To satisfy this simplified condition, the empty set. But hang on. We've counted the case where both X and Y are the empty set twice. Ah, right. Double counted. Exactly. So we have 2n possibilities plus another 2n possibilities minus the one we double counted. That gives us 2n plus 2n1, which simplifies nicely to 2n1, or 2n plus 1, 1. And that, of course, is An plus 1. That simpler explanation really does clarify it. Okay. Now shifting gears just slightly. The OEIS mentions a connection to Gaussian binomial coefficients. For our listeners who might be diving into more advanced number theory, what's the significance of that particular link? Well, the fact that An is the Gaussian binomial coefficient, often written N1Q, with the parameter Q set specifically to 2, it provides a fascinating bridge, connects to catalogs and combinatorics. You can think of Gaussian binomial coefficients as a sort of generalization of standard binomial coefficients, but they incorporate this variable, Q. When Q takes a specific value of 2, this more general structure collapses precisely down to our familiar 2n1. It really highlights how this sequence isn't just some isolated phenomenon, but actually fits within these broader frameworks in combinatorial algebra. It's amazing, isn't it, how this seemingly simple sequence turns out to be just a specific instance of these more abstract concepts. Now for something maybe a bit more tangible, the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. It seems our sequence plays a starring role there, too. It does indeed, a classic. The minimum number of moves required to solve the standard Tower of Hanoi puzzle with n disks. It's exactly An equal to 2n1. Think about the puzzle with just two disks. You need three moves, right? Move the small disk, move the large disk, then move the small disk back on top. Three moves. And A2 is indeed 2 squared minus 1, which equals 3. It's a really beautiful demonstration of the exponential growth that's just inherent in the problem's recursive structure. That's a perfect concrete example. Yeah, the OEIS also points out that our sequence, A000225, is just one member of a larger family. Precisely. The formula An 2n1 is, you could say, a specific case of the more general form, An1, A1, where A is some integer greater than or equal to 2. Our sequence is just the case where A equals 2. And the OEIS helpfully cross-references related sequences for other values of A, like A03462 for A3, or A02450 for 4, and so on. This shows how A000225 sits within a broader landscape of sequences with similar underlying multiplicative structures. It's like seeing the template, yeah, for a whole family of sequences. Now let's look at another seemingly unrelated area, Pascal's Triangle. Yes, another elegant connection there. So the sum of the elements in the nth row of Pascal's Triangle, if we start counting from n0 at the top 1, is 2 to the power of n. Consequently, if you sum up all the elements in a Pascal's Triangle down to the nth row, so including row 0 up to n1, the total sum is 2n1, which is our sequence, An. And again, it's a nice interplay between binomial coefficients and powers of 2. The connections just keep unfolding. It's quite remarkable how this basic formula keeps popping up in different mathematical domains. Okay, so the OEIS then introduces Stirling numbers of the second kind. For our audience, what do those generally describe, and how do they tie into our sequence, A000225? Right, Stirling numbers of the second kind, they're usually denoted Smnk. Basically, they count the number of ways you can partition or divide up a set of n objects into exactly k non-empty unordered subsets. The OEIS highlights that our sequence term An is equal to Sm plus 1 to 2. Okay, Sm plus 1 to 2. Yes. So in simpler terms, 2n1 represents the number of ways you can divide a set containing n plus 1 elements into precisely two non-empty groups. The example given for n3 is quite illustrative. We know A3 is 7, and S4 to 2 is also 7. It represents the seven distinct ways you can split a four-element set into two non-empty parts. That provides a deeper understanding of the combinatorial richness of this sequence. From subsets to partitions, these fundamental counting principles are really at play. And the OEIS keeps going. It mentions relevance to the frogs problem. Ah, the frogs problem. Another classic puzzle. You typically have, say, n brown frogs and n green frogs on lily pads in a line facing each other with one empty pad in the middle. The goal is to get the brown frogs to where the green frogs started and vice versa, following certain jumping rules. And the minimum number of moves required to interchange these n frogs on each side turns out to be, guess what? An equals 2n1. Another puzzle neatly solved by our sequence. It's incredibly versatile. Then venturing into graph theory, the OEIS states that An is the length of the longest path in an n-dimensional
