## Transcript

Buckle up, everybody, because today we're taking a deep dive into a world of speed and spectacle. Yeah, we're talking chariots. But not just the races themselves. Right. We're going deeper. Behind the scenes. Into the engineering and the construction that made these ancient speed machines possible. The tech that made them go. Exactly. We've got some great sources lined up for this deep dive, too. Oh, yeah. We're looking at Wikipedia articles on chariots and chariot racing. Classic. And to get really technical, we've even got a scientific paper analyzing a chariot wheel from the early Iron Age. That's going to be interesting. So get ready to uncover the ingenuity behind these ancient marvels. Maybe bust some Hollywood myths along the way. Who knows? Sounds fun. Okay, so we all know chariots were used in warfare and racing. Right. But let's start with the basics. Okay. What innovations made chariots such effective vehicles? Well, you can't talk chariots without talking about the spoked wheel. Ah, the spoked wheel. Seems simple now. But back then, revolutionary. I can only imagine what it was like before that. Solid wheels. Yeah. Heavy and slow. Must have been a real workout to move those things. Absolutely. So the spoked wheel. Yeah. Lighter. Okay. More agile. Faster chariots. Easier to navigate rough terrain. Makes sense. So is that why we see the rise of chariots around 2000 BC? That's around then, yeah. With the Sintashta culture. That's right, the Sintashta. They were early doctors, weren't they? Oh, yeah. Modern-day Russia. Yeah. Among the first to use spoked-wheeled chariots extensively. Interesting. And there's even evidence they were buried with their chariots. We found that, yeah. Wow, that says a lot about how important those chariots were to them. Hugely important. Almost like an extension of themselves. You could say that. And this also makes me think about the horses. The horses? Yeah. Weren't the Sintashta also connected to the ancestors of modern horses? Oh, absolutely. Fascinating. The Domintou horse population. Those are considered the ancestors of our modern domestic horses. So we've got this brand-new wheel design. Revolutionary. And horses bred for power and endurance. Perfect combination. No wonder chariots became so dominant. It was a game-changer. Speaking of which, one of our sources mentioned the Hittites. The Hittites, uh-huh. Using chariots to sack Babylon in 1595 BC. Oh, yeah. Must have been terrifying. Can you imagine? An army of chariots charging towards you. Thundering hooves. Dust clouds billowing. Archers raining down arrows. It must have been quite the sight. And strategically so effective. Mobile platform. Right. Cover ground quickly. Disrupt formations. That strike from a distance. It's like the ancient world's version of a tank. Pretty much. But chariots weren't just limited to warfare. No. No. They became central to another form of competition. Oh, yeah. Chariot racing. The races. And when it comes to chariot racing, we have to talk about the Romans. They were the masters. Took it to a whole new level. Absolutely. All right, picture this. Okay. You're in the Circus Maximus. The grandest of them all. The grandest chariot racing stadium in Rome. Packed. Over 250,000 screaming spectators. Electric atmosphere. All eager to see their favorite teams compete. It was a spectacle. More than just a sport, right? Oh, much more. It was a cultural phenomenon. Yes. So these different chariot teams. Factions, they were called. Okay, the factions, they represented different social groups. Absolutely. Even political ideologies. You could say that. And their colors. Ah, the colors. Red, blue, green, and white. More than just colors. They were symbols. People rallied behind them. So it was like a sporting event. Yeah. A political rally. Uh-huh. And a rock concert all rolled into one. All in one. Wow. Yeah. And at the heart of it all. Yeah. These incredibly engineered chariots. Of course. Let's talk design. Design. Specifically, the Roman racing chariot. Okay. The big model. The biga. So the biga was a two-horse chariot, right? Two-horse, that's right. And what's interesting is, from what we can tell from archaeological finds, like the model in the British Museum, they were surprisingly small and lightweight. Yeah, very much so. So the chariot's body. Yeah. It was basically an open frame. Simple construction. Primarily made of wood, leather, and rawhide. That's right. That's interesting. It seems almost minimalist. Minimalist, yeah. Compared to the image of elaborate war chariots we often see. Yeah. So why the focus on being lightweight? Well, think about it. Yeah. Speed was everything in chariot racing. Right. Every pound mattered. Okay. The lighter the chariot, the faster it could go. Gotcha. And more agile on the track. And those turns in the Circus Maximus. Don't forget the turns. Yeah. They were tight. And dangerous. Very dangerous. So maneuverability and speed were crucial. Absolutely crucial. This brings us to another interesting detail about Roman chariot design. What's that? The wheels were removable. Oh, yeah. Removable wheels. Not something you see every day. I've never heard of that before. Why would they do that? It's all about the materials. The materials. And the physics. So the wheels, usually wood with a tension rim. Okay. They could warp over time if left under constant pressure. I see. So removing them after each race helped maintain their shape and integrity. Brilliant. It's simple. Yeah. But effective. Preventative maintenance. Exactly. Goes to show how much thought went into even the smallest details of chariot construction. They thought of everything. Amazing. And speaking of details, there's a specific chariot wheel. Oh. It reveals a remarkable understanding of physics and engineering. You've got my attention. It's called the Mercuryago wheel. The Mercuryago wheel. And it dates back to the Iron Age. Okay. Tell me more. What's so special about this Mercuryago wheel? Well, unlike typical chariot wheels, this one had an iron rim on just the right wheel. Just the right wheel. That's right. That wasn't a mistake, was it? No, no. Deliberate? Engineering decision. Absolutely. You see, Roman chariot races were always run counterclockwise. Counterclockwise. So that means... What does it mean? The right side of the chariot would be under a lot more stress. A lot more stress. Especially during those turns. The right wheel specifically. Right wheel, exactly. Wow. So adding that iron rim... Yeah. It reinforced that wheel. Made it less likely to collapse. Under pressure. Under pressure. It's like they understood the concept of stress points and targeted reinforcement centuries before modern engineering. They were ahead of their time. It wasn't about making the chariot faster. No. It was about reliability. Reliability. Durability. Durability. Making sure that chariot could withstand the punishment of the race. Strategic advantage. Oh, yeah. Way to outlast the competition. That's fascinating. Makes you wonder about the charioteers themselves. A charioteer? The person behind the reins of these incredible machines. What was it like to be them? Yeah. What was it like? That's a great question. And one we'll explore in our next deep dive. All right, everyone. Stay tuned. We'll be right back. All right. So last time we talked about the chariots themselves. The engineering marvels. Exactly. But now let's talk about the people. The people who made them go. The charioteers. The daredevils behind those breakneck speeds. And risking their lives. Yeah. Out there on the track. And you know. Yeah. We may not have detailed biographies for every charioteer. Of course not. But we do have inscriptions. Okay. And some historical accounts. And those give us... They give us glimpses. Glimpses into their world. Exactly. And it's interesting, right? What's interesting? This contrast. Contrast between... The adulation they received from the crowds versus their actual social standing. Ah, yes. Especially in Roman society. Interesting point. So they weren't exactly treated like, say, star athletes. Not quite. More like, what, gladiators? Yeah. I think that's a good comparison. Popular? Sure. Yeah. But occupied a lower social rung. Really? Often slaves or freedmen. Wow. Necessary for the spectacle? I guess so. But not truly respected. That seems a bit unfair, doesn't it? You could say that. I mean, they were the ones out there facing the danger. Head on. Incredible skill and bravery. It was a strange dichotomy. It really was. So under Roman law, they were classified as infamis. Infamis. That's right. Same designation as actors and gladiators. So their profession carried a certain stigma. Definitely. But at least they were well compensated for the risks. Well, that's one way to look at it. I mean, I recall reading that some charioteers, they earned a fortune. Some of them, yes. Even more than wealthy lawyers? That's true. Wow. The most successful charioteers. Yeah. They could amass incredible wealth. So like Gaius Apulius Diocles. Gaius Apulius Diocles. Oh, yeah.
