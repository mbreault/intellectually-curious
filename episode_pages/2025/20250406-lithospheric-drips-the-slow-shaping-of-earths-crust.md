## Description

In this Deep Dive episode, we unravel lithospheric drippingâ€”the slow, gravity-driven ooze of the lower crust into the mantle. From Turkey's Central Anatolian Plateau to the American Midwest (and even the Andes), we explore how advanced seismic imaging, satellite data, and lab analogs are revealing a process that subtly reshapes landscapes over millions of years. Discover how multi-stage dripping can uplift broad regions and then trigger localized subsidence, challenging and expanding our view of plate tectonics. Youâ€™ll leave with a clearer picture of how Earth evolves, one slow drip at a time.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone, to the Deep Dive. Are you ready to delve into some pretty fascinating Earth science today? Always ready to dig deep. Well, great, because today we're going to be talking about lithospheric dripping, which I know it sounds a bit like something out of a sci-fi movie, maybe, but it's a real thing, a geological process. Oh, it's very real, and it's prompting a lot of scientists to kind of rethink what they thought they knew about, you know, how our planet works, how it evolves over these vast time scales. Right, and it's kind of changing how we look at plate tectonics, which is, you know, the big picture of how continents move and, you know, mountains form. Yeah. So before we get into the, you know, the nitty gritty, can we just sort of, for those who are hearing this for the first time, what exactly is lithospheric dripping? I mean, the name itself is pretty evocative. Yeah, it does conjure up a certain image. Maybe a good way to think about it is, I don't know if you've ever seen those demonstrations of like a pitch drop experiment, where you have this material that seems completely solid, right? Like you could tap on it and it would feel hard. But over many, many years, it slowly drips like a very, very viscous fluid. Right. And so that's kind of what we're talking about with lithospheric dripping. Imagine that same kind of slow, almost imperceptible flow happening, but with the Earth's lithosphere. And the lithosphere is that outer rigid shell of our planet. Okay, so the whole, like the Earth's crust and the very uppermost part of the mantle. Exactly, yeah. So it includes the crust and that uppermost part of the mantle. They kind of behave as a single unit. Okay. And so what happens is you can have portions of that lithosphere, especially the lower part of the crust, that can heat up and become less viscous, more like, you know, a very thick syrup or honey. And then because it's denser than the surrounding material, it can start to slowly ooze downward into the mantle, driven by gravity. Right. Yeah, the scientists at the SHLeds put it like they said that the lower crust heats up and becomes gooey. Yeah. And then, yeah, it slowly oozes down where it's like honey or syrup. Yeah, that's a great way to visualize it. And it's that gooeyness that's really key because it's not like a, you know, a solid block just breaking off and falling. It's more of a, you know, a slow deformation and sinking. Right, like a very slow motion drip. Exactly. Yeah, it's over geological timescale, so we're talking millions of years. Yeah, millions of years for maybe like a single drip to sort of work its way down. Right. So this isn't just a theory, right? I mean, scientists are actually seeing evidence of this happening in different parts of the world. Yeah, it's not just hypothetical anymore. We're actually observing this in action. And there are two really fascinating examples that have been in the news recently. One is beneath Turkey in the central Anatolian plateau. Right. And the other one, which is maybe even more surprising, is right here beneath the American Midwest. Yeah, that's the one that really kind of caught my eye because you think of the Midwest as being like geologically stable, not much happening. Right, yeah. You don't think of the Midwest as a hotbed of tectonic activity. But it turns out that even these seemingly stable regions can be undergoing some pretty interesting changes beneath the surface. Right, and there were some articles that I came across, you know, suggesting that this might be even more widespread than we initially thought. Like there was one in Life Science that said that it could happen wherever mountains form. And then Science Alert mentioned that they found evidence of it under the Andes Mountains, too. Yeah, it's becoming increasingly clear that this is not just a, you know, a freak occurrence in a couple of places. It seems to be a more fundamental process that could be happening in many different tectonic settings around the world. Wow. So it's kind of changing the way we look at how those surface features that we see, you know, mountains and basins and things like that, how those are formed. Absolutely. And the reason we're starting to understand this better now is because of advances in technology. Like we have much better seismic imaging techniques now, which are kind of like giving us an x-ray vision into the Earth's interior. And we also have much more precise satellite data that can detect these subtle changes in the Earth's surface elevation. So as our tools get better, we're able to see these things that we couldn't see before. And as we're kind of getting more attuned to what those signatures of lithospheric dripping look like, we're starting to find evidence of it in more and more places. Yeah, exactly. And what's really exciting is that these different locations seem to be showing us different stages or styles of dripping. So we're getting a more complete picture of how this process works and all the different ways it can manifest. So what we're really trying to do today is to understand this new kind of plate tectonics, right? It's not just about those big horizontal movements of plates that we learn about in school. It's also about this slow downward movement, this dripping that's shaping the Earth's surface. And we want to see what the implications are, what it means for, you know, how our planet evolves. So let's start with Turkey. What's going on there? What's the evidence that they're seeing? So the Central Anatolian Plateau has really become a kind of a textbook example of lithospheric dripping. Okay. And there were some really great articles about it in the Ice Age Floods Institute, Science Alert, and the University of Toronto. They all had some good coverage. Okay. And what's really interesting is when you look at the surface of this plateau, you see these unusual features like these crinkles and divots. Okay. And in particular, there's this big depression called the Konya Basin. Right, right. That sits right in the middle of this plateau that's generally being uplifted. So it's kind of counterintuitive. You've got this area that's sinking while everything around it is rising. And that's one of the clues that something unusual is happening beneath the surface. So what have the researchers kind of pieced together about what happened? What's the sequence of events? Well, they think that there was a two-stage process. Okay. So first you had this primary drip event, which was happening on a larger scale beneath the whole plateau. And as that denser material in the lower crust detached and sank into the mantle, it caused the whole region to uplift. Okay. So it's kind of like if you imagine a heavy weight on a trampoline. Yeah. And then you suddenly remove that weight, the trampoline is going to spring back up. Exactly, yeah. It's like the land is rebounding after losing some of that dense material beneath it. And according to the Ice Age Floods Institute, they estimated that this uplift has been about a kilometer over the past 10 million years. Wow. So it's a very slow process, but it's had a huge impact on the landscape. Okay. But then what's really interesting is that after this initial uplift, you had this secondary smaller drip that developed specifically beneath the Konya Basin. Okay. And this second drip is causing the basin to subside, to sink, and it's happening relatively quickly too. Okay. Science Alert mentioned it was about 20 millimeters per year. Wow. So while that might not seem like a lot, geologically speaking, it's a pretty significant change, especially when you consider that the rest of the plateau is still uplifting. Right. So it's like you've got this one area that's sinking while everything around it is rising. Exactly. Yeah. It's very strange. And it really highlights the complexity of these processes. I mean, you have this initial drip that triggers this broad uplift. And then that same initial drip can also spawn these smaller secondary drips, which can then cause localized subsidence. It's like one geological event can beget another. Yeah, it's a chain reaction. Right. And one of the scientists involved in this research, Russell Fischoeck from the University of Toronto, he said that this initial drip could have set the stage for these subsequent daughter events, as he called them. Interesting. So to really kind of visualize how this might work, scientists have been using these laboratory models, right? Yeah, they're called analog models. Yeah. And they're really cool. Basically, they're trying to recreate the conditions of the Earth's interior in a lab setting. Okay. So they'll use materials like PDMS, which is this kind of silicone polymer. That simulates the more fluid-like mantle. And then they'll use things like modeling clay or ceramic spheres or even silica sand to represent the more rigid crust. And then they'll apply forces to these materials to see how they deform over time. Right. It's kind of like playing with Play-Doh, but on a much more sophisticated level. Exactly. But the results can be really insightful. I mean, the University of Toronto and Science Alert both had articles describing some of these experiments. Right. And what they found was that they could actually reproduce these multi-stage dripping events. They could create both the uplift and the localized subsidence, just like what we see in Turkey. Okay. And they could do it all without any significant horizontal movement of the crust. Right. So it's really distinct from those classic plate tectonics where you have those plates colliding and sliding past each other. Exactly. This is a completely different mechanism that's driving these changes in the Earth's surface. So these models really kind of lend weight to the idea that what we're seeing in Turkey is actually caused by lithospheric dripping. Absolutely. And it's not just
