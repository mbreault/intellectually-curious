## Description

A deep dive into how the multi-objective Escaping Bird Search (MOEBs) algorithm can optimize transformer models to forecast stock trends. Weâ€™ll explore why single-objective optimization can miss important factors, how MOEBs is benchmarked (ZDT, DTLZ, WFG), and how a MOEBs-tuned transformer was tested on real-world data from Amazon, Google, and Uniqlo. Along the way we discuss market drivers, sentiment, black swan events, and the promise and limits of AI-driven investing.

## Transcript

Hey everyone and welcome back for another deep dive. Today we're going to be looking at something. Pretty cool. Yeah pretty wild actually. It's about how algorithms that are inspired by birds escaping predators can actually be used to predict the stock market. It's really fascinating stuff. Yeah I know right. We've got some research excerpts here to guide our deep dive from a nature paper. Okay. So get ready because we're going to be talking about some pretty complex ideas. Yeah. Like multi objective optimization. The escaping bird search algorithm. The EBS. Yeah EBS. We'll probably just call it that. And even how all of this connects to the super powerful transformer model that's used in AI. Yeah the transformer is a really game changer. For sure for sure. Okay so before we get too deep into the algorithms let's just like take a step back and think about the stock market itself. I mean it's influenced by so many things. It is. It's practically a force of nature in and of itself. Yeah it really is. I mean the paper even mentions factors like global economic growth, government policies, even just the general mood of the market. Oh yes sentiment, market sentiment. That's one. Like how are people feeling? Yeah exactly. Yeah and it's crazy how all those things can just change like that. Yeah. Completely throw off any predictions you might have had. I mean and then on top of that you have unexpected events that like nobody could have predicted. Like a black swan event? Yeah a black swan. So like natural disaster, political scandal, even a viral tweet can send the market into like a frenzy. Yeah I mean we've seen it happen haven't we? Oh all the time. With you know Elon Musk and all sorts of folks. Yeah for sure. So it's really no wonder that people are always trying to find an edge you know. Right. Like some way to try and predict what's going to happen next. Absolutely. And that's where machine learning comes in. That's exactly where it comes in. Machine learning is completely changing the way we analyze financial data. These days we're seeing really advanced models like neural networks being used to you know really try to decode the stock market's patterns. Oh yeah yeah. And you know one model in particular that seems to be making waves is the transformer. Yeah. What makes it so special? So the transformer is unique because it's really good at handling these long sequences of data. Okay. And the way it does that is by using something called an attention mechanism. Okay. Which allows it to you know focus on the most important parts of the data. Okay. Kind of like how we as humans pay attention to certain details while ignoring others. Yeah. So this ability to kind of see the big picture is super important for understanding the stock market. Makes sense. But even with these powerful tools it sounds like there's always a catch right? Yeah there's always a catch. So traditional machine learning often relies on something called single objective optimization. Okay. And what that means is it's focused on maximizing just one metric. Like accuracy. Okay. But isn't being accurate the whole point? Well yeah you'd think so right. But imagine if you were training for a marathon and you only focused on speed. Okay. You might be super fast. But if you haven't you know built up your stamina you're not even going to finish the race. Right. Yeah. It's kind of the same with these models. If they're only optimized for accuracy they might miss other important factors. Which could make them you know less reliable in the long run. Okay so it's like a trade-off. You might get accuracy but you lose out on other important aspects of the body's performance. You got it. And that's where this idea of multi-objective optimization comes into play. It's all about finding the best possible balance between these different objectives. Not just focusing on one. Okay and that's where our feathered friends come in right? Right. Birds escaping predators. How on earth does that help us predict the stock market? Well it's a surprisingly elegant connection. It all starts with the escaping bird search algorithm or EBS. Okay. Which was inspired by you know birds in a flock evade predators. A real classic life or death scenario. So picture like a hawk swooping down on a flock of I don't know starlings let's say. And they just scatter in all directions. Yeah. It's amazing how they manage to avoid collisions. It is remarkable and EBS draws inspiration from those like swooped and unpredictable movements. So in the algorithm these movements are actually represented by two different types of maneuvers. Okay. You've got level maneuvering which is where the birds change direction horizontally. Okay. And you've got vertical maneuvering where they're adjusting their altitude. Okay so I can kind of picture the birds like dodging and weaving in my mind. Yeah. But how does this translate into an algorithm that can like handle something as complex as the stock market? Well think of the birds as like potential solutions to a problem. And they're moving through this like search space looking for the optimal solution. So these maneuvers allow them to explore different areas of this space. Okay. Trying out different combinations, different approaches. So the birds are like little explorers. That's a great way to put it. Trying to find the best path through a complex landscape. Yeah and it's like a bird trying to survive. The algorithm is trying to find the best solution. The one that best balances all the different objectives. Okay so that's EBS. But we were talking about multi-objective optimization. How does EBS make that leap? Well EBS gets a pretty big upgrade. Okay. It becomes MOEBs. MOEBs. Multi-objective escaping bird search. It's like EBS. But with a supercharged engine. Okay. And a GPS system. So EBS uses an archive to store the best solutions it finds along the way. Okay. And it uses a grid system to like map out the search space. So it's making sure it's thoroughly exploring all the possibilities. So it's not just randomly flying around anymore. It's like systematically searching for the best solution while keeping track of the good one it's already found. Exactly. And that systematic approach is really key. Because it helps MOEBs avoid getting stuck in dead ends. And it ensures that it's finding truly robust solutions. That's pretty impressive. But before we unleash MOEBs on the stock market, how do we even know if this algorithm is any good? Like how do we measure its success? That's a great question. So to really test MOEBs, the researchers put it through a series of various benchmark tests. Okay. Think of them like standardized tests for optimization algorithms. Okay. And they're designed to challenge them with a variety of difficult problems. Okay. So they used standard benchmarks like ZDT, DTLZ, and WFG. Basically obstacle courses for our bird-inspired algorithm. Sounds like a real trial by fire. It is. So how did it do? Did it soar through these tests? It did. MOEBs consistently outperformed other established multi-objective optimization algorithms in these tests, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in tackling complex challenges. Okay. So what that means is we can be confident that it's not just a one-trick pony. It's a reliable tool that can handle a wide range of problems. That's amazing. It sounds like Robax is ready to take on the stock market. But how do we actually apply this bird-inspired algorithm to something as intricate as predicting stock prices? Well, that's where things get even more interesting. Okay. And we'll dive into the specifics of how MOEBs was used to optimize a transformer model for stock prediction after a quick break. So we know MOEBs is good at solving these complex problems, but how do we actually use it to predict, you know, stock prices? Yeah, I'm really curious about that. Like, how do those birds help us navigate the world of investing? It sounds almost too good to be true. Well, it's not about, you know, like finding some guaranteed path to riches or anything. Remember, the stock market is incredibly complex, influenced by so many things, a lot of which are impossible to predict with like 100% certainty. But what MOEBs can do is help us build more sophisticated and reliable models that can identify trends, assess risks, and potentially, you know, lead to more informed investment decisions. Okay, so it's more about like having a smarter approach rather than expecting the algorithm to tell us exactly what to buy and sell. Right, it's not a crystal ball. So to answer your question about how MOEBs is applied to stock prediction, the researchers took that powerful transformer model we talked about. Okay. And they used MOEBs to fine-tune it. Okay. Think of MOEBs like a personal trainer for the transformer, you know, pushing it to reach its full potential. So MOEBs helps the transformer make sense of all the data and make more accurate predictions. That's the idea. Specifically, MOEBs was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the transformer model. Okay. These are basically the settings that control how the model learns and makes predictions. Okay. Think of them like the knobs and dials on a sophisticated machine that need to be adjusted just right. Okay. So MOEBs found the optimal settings for things like the learning rate, the number of attention heads, and the regularization coefficient. Okay. All very technical, behind-the-scenes stuff. It sounds complicated, but I guess that's what makes MOEBs so valuable. It can handle all that complexity and find the best possible configuration for the model. That's right. And to make sure the model was really up to the task, they trained and tested it on real-world stock data from three very different companies. Okay. Amazon, Google, and Uniqlo. Interesting choice of companies. What was the thinking behind that? Well, they wanted to test the MOEBs-optimized transformer on a diverse set of stocks. Okay. You know, Amazon and Google are tech giants,
