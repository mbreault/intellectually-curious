## Description

In this episode we explore A000135, the number of ways to write a positive integer n as a sum of distinct terms of the form m^(2/3) (the two-thirds power of integers). We unpack what it means to partition with non-integer powers, why the terms must be distinct, and how this unusual rule leads to connections with statistical mechanicsâ€”modeling energy levels E_m = m^(2/3)â€”as discussed in the Agarwalâ€“Alok line of work. Weâ€™ll cover why there isnâ€™t a simple closed-form formula for A000135, how recursive descriptions and asymptotic techniques help us understand its growth, and what hints it might offer about deeper links to analytic number theory and primes. Along the way weâ€™ll outline the combinatorial questions that arise and point to open problems and directions for further exploration.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing exploration of fascinating integer sequences from the OEIS database. Today we're diving into A000135, titled Number of Partitions into Non-Integral Powers. As number theory students, I think you'll find this one particularly interesting. It is a sequence that might seem a bit complex at first glance, but it leads to some intriguing mathematical ideas, especially when we start connecting it to other fields. So let's break it down. What exactly is A000135 counting? I know we're dealing with partitions, but what makes these partitions unique? So you're right, it all starts with the concept of partitions. As you know, a partition of a positive integer is simply a way of writing as a sum of positive integers. Where A000135 gets interesting is the type of powers involved. Instead of using whole number exponents, we're using fractional powers. Specifically, we're raising integers to the power of 2 thirds. So we're essentially squaring the cube root of integers. Yes. That sounds a bit unusual. Yeah. What's the motivation behind choosing this specific exponent? That's a great question. And honestly, the beauty sometimes lies in the unexpected. Choosing this specific exponent leads to some fascinating connections, particularly with statistical mechanics. But we'll get to that later for now. Let's focus on what the sequence actually counts. A000135 tells us how many ways we can express an integer as the sum of these unique non-integral powers, always using distinct integers. Okay, I think I'm following. So for example, if n is 3, the sequence considers all the possible sums we can create using distinct integers raised to the power of 2 thirds, ensuring each sum is less than or equal to 3. Precisely. The OEIS entry gives us six solutions for n 3. It starts with 1 raised to the power of 2 thirds, which is less than 3. Then it considers 1 to the power of 2 thirds plus 2 to the power of 2 thirds, and so on, up to 5 to the power of 2 thirds. Each of these sums is less than or equal to 3, giving us six possible ways to partition 3 using this specific rule. So the sixth term in the sequence, A000135, would be 6. Correct. This is fascinating. But why would mathematicians choose to study partitions with this specific exponent? That's where it gets really interesting. While the choice of exponent might seem arbitrary at first, it turns out that A000135 has a surprising connection to statistical mechanics. Oh, wow. A branch of physics that deals with the behavior of systems with a large number of particles. Now that you mention it, I vaguely remember encountering something called partition functions in statistical mechanics. Right. Could there be a link? Absolutely. The link lies in a paper by Agarwal and Alok titled Statistical Mechanics and Partitions into Non-Integral Powers of Integers. They discovered that this type of partition problem, where we use non-integral powers, can be used to model and understand how energy is distributed within a physical system. So the way we can break down a number into sums of non-integral powers has implications for how energy is spread out in a physical system. Yes. That's remarkable. It might seem like a stretch, but the underlying mathematical principles are surprisingly similar to understand with connection better. Let's imagine a system where the energy levels are integers raised to the power of 2 thirds. Okay, I'm picturing it. So if we have a fixed amount of total energy to distribute among particles in this system. Exactly. And each particle can only occupy these specific energy levels, which are defined by integers raised to the power of 2 thirds. The question then becomes, how many different ways can we distribute this total energy among the particles, ensuring each particle occupies one of the allowed energy levels? I see where this is going. A000135 comes into play here. Because it essentially tells us how many ways we can partition our total energy into these specific energy levels. You got it. Okay. The sequence provides a way to quantify the different energy configurations available to the system. It's like using the sequence as a tool to count the possible states of a physical system based on these specific energy levels. Wow. This is a powerful link between number theory and physics. This is truly mind-boggling. Yeah. I wouldn't have guessed that a number sequence could have such a direct connection to physics. Right. But I'm also curious about the mathematical properties of A000135 itself. Yeah. We mentioned earlier that it grows quite rapidly. Are there any patterns or formulas we can use to predict its terms? That's a question mathematicians have been exploring for decades. Unfortunately, unlike some sequences with simple recursive formulas, A000135 doesn't have a straightforward closed-form formula to calculate the nth term directly. So it's not as simple as the Fibonacci sequence? Right. Where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones? Not quite. Okay. However, there are recursive formulas and asymptotic approximations that provide insights into the sequence's behavior. Okay. These methods involve more complex techniques. Right. And delving into them would take us a bit deeper into advanced mathematical territory. I understand. Okay. It's fascinating to know that mathematicians are actively working on unraveling the mysteries of A000135. Yeah. This deep dive is already revealing so much more about this sequence than I initially anticipated. It's a testament to the fact that even seemingly simple mathematical concepts can lead to profound and unexpected connections. Right. And we've only just begun our exploration. Yeah. There's still much more to uncover. Okay. It really highlights the interconnected nature of mathematics and how exploration can lead to unexpected discoveries. Yeah. So we've touched upon this connection to statistical mechanics. Right. But I'd love to delve a bit deeper. For our number theory students listening. Yeah. Can you give us a more concrete example? Sure. Of how A000135 applies to this field. Absolutely. Okay. Let's consider a simplified model. Okay. Where we have a system with a fixed amount of energy. Okay. Say 10 units. Right. And let's say the particles in this system can only exist at energy levels that are integers raised to the power of 2 thirds. Okay. So our energy levels would be 1 to the power of 2 thirds. Yes. 2 to the power of 2 thirds. Uh-huh. 3 to the power of 2 thirds and so on. Exactly. Okay. Now the question is how many different ways can we distribute these 10 units of energy among the particles given these specific energy levels? So one way could be to have one particle at the energy level of 10 to the power of 2 thirds. Right. Or we could have two particles, one at 5 to the power of 2 thirds and another at 5 to the power of 2 thirds. Exactly. And so on. Precisely. And this is where A000135 comes in. Okay. The sequence helps us count these possibilities. Right. It tells us how many ways we can partition our 10 units of energy into sums of distinct integers raised to the power of 2 thirds. So in essence, A000135 gives us a way to quantify the number of possible energy configurations in this system. Yes. That's a pretty neat application of a seemingly abstract number sequence. It really is. It shows how a mathematical concept from number theory can have tangible implications in understanding physical phenomena. This connection is fascinating. Yeah. But I want to come back to A000135 as a sequence itself. Okay. We've talked about how it doesn't have a simple closed-form formula. Right. But are there any notable properties or patterns that mathematicians have observed in its behavior? That's a great question. Yeah. While a simple formula remains elusive, mathematicians have discovered interesting properties through recursive formulas and asymptotic analysis. Okay. For instance, they found that the growth rate of A000135 is closely related to the growth rate of another fascinating mathematical function called the Riemann zeta function. The Riemann zeta function? Yes. I remember encountering that in my complex analysis class. Uh-huh. It's known for its deep connections to prime numbers, right? Exactly. And this connection between A000135 and the Riemann zeta function hints at a possible link between this partition problem and the distribution of prime numbers. Wow. Which is a really exciting avenue for further research. So exploring a seemingly simple sequence like A000135 could potentially lead to insights into one of the biggest mysteries in number theory? It could. The distribution of primes. Yeah. That's incredible. It truly shows how interconnected different areas of mathematics can be. Right. Exploring one concept can unexpectedly illuminate other areas and lead to new discoveries. This deep dive has certainly highlighted that. Right. We started with a sequence defined by a peculiar partitioning rule. Yeah. And we've uncovered connections to statistical mechanics, advanced mathematical functions, and even hints at potential links to the distribution of primes. It's pretty fascinating. It's amazing how much depth lies beneath the surface. It's a reminder that in mathematics, even seemingly simple concepts can harbor profound secrets waiting to be uncovered. Yeah. And often the most exciting discoveries come from exploring those unexpected connections between different areas of study. Speaking of exploring. Yeah. Are there other areas of mathematics behind statistical mechanics? And potentially prime number theory? Right. Where A000135 or similar sequences might have applications? That's a great question. And it's one that researchers are actively exploring. Right. One promising area is combinatorics. Okay. The branch of mathematics concerned with counting and arranging objects. I could see how artitions, the foundation of A000135, would naturally connect to problems in combinatorics, which often involve counting different ways to arrange or select items. Exactly. Right. And the specific constraints of A000135 using distinct integers raised to a specific fractional power could potentially model unique combinatorial scenarios. Okay. For instance, imagine you're designing a system where you
