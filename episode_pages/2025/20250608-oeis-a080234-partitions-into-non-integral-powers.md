## Description

We explore A080234, the counting function for the number of nondecreasing sequences of positive integers (psi1, psi2, ..., psik) with psi1 â‰¥ 1, k â‰¤ n, and sum of psi_i^23 â‰¤ n. Through concrete examples (like a3 = 8) we see how this generalizes ordinary partitions by replacing summands with non-integral-power weights. Weâ€™ll trace the historical thread from mid-20th-century physics, where partition-like counts appeared in studies of energy levels and statistical mechanics, to modern work that uses these generalized partitions to probe asymptotics, generating functions, and connections to analytic number theory. This episode highlights how a seemingly niche sequence opens doors to physics, combinatorics, and deep analysis.}

## Transcript

Welcome back to The Deep Dive. We're continuing our journey through the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS. We're digging into some really interesting sequences, connecting them to the wider landscape of number theory. Hopefully useful for you students really getting into the field. That's right. And for this particular deep dive, we've gathered quite a bit of material. We have the OEIS entry itself for sequence 080234, but also some foundational historical papers and even some recent research. It all comes together to show how this one sequence touches on some pretty surprising areas. Yeah. So our mission today is to really unpack 080234. It's listed as partitions into non-integral powers. We want to figure out, okay, what does that actually mean? Where did it come from? And then how does it connect to these other fascinating, maybe even slightly counterintuitive ways people generalize partitions and counting based on the sources we have? Exactly. It's actually a perfect example, I think, of how a sequence that looks maybe a little niche at first glance can lead you down paths connecting to physics, of all things, and some really deep analytic techniques in number theory. Okay. Let's dive right in then. A000234. The OEIS entry, authored by Neil Sloan himself, defines it as counting the number of solutions to a specific inequality. Right. The inequality is the sum of psi raised to the power of 23 for i equals 1, 2, and so on. That sum must be less than or equal to n. Okay. Sum i equals n. But there are rules for the tocs, aren't there? Yes, crucial rules. The tocs values themselves have to be integers, and they have to form a non-decreasing list starting from 1. So 1 equals by 1, by 2 equals by 3, and so on. Good non-decreasing integer. And the list has to have at least one term by 1, but it can't have more than n terms in total. Right. So this is quite different from the standard partition function Pn, where you're just summing integers to get exactly n. Here, the bases are integers, but you raise them to this non-integral power, 23, and you're counting lists where the sum of those results stays below or equal to n. Precisely. That's the key difference. You're not partitioning directly. You're counting the allowed lists of integer bases psi, whose transformed values psi of 23 sum up correctly according to the inequality. It's a subtle but important distinction. Okay. The OEIS entry gives the first few terms, 1, 3, 8, 18, 37. Let's maybe look at that example for a3 equals 8. How do we get 8 solutions? Yeah, that example really helps clarify things. We need some psi i less 3. Let's break it down by the number of terms in the list by 1 by 2. Okay. One term first. Right. If we have just one term up by 1, we need by 123, a03, since by 1 must be an integer, by 1 by 1, we just check. 123 is 1. That's less than or equal to 3. So 1, 1 is one solution. 223 is about 1.587, still 3. So by 1, 2 is another. 323 is about 2.08, still good. By 1, 3, 423 is about 2.52, still good. By 1, 4, 523 is about 2.92, still good. By 1, 5. Almost there. Yeah. But 623 is about 3.30. That's greater than 3. So we stop. The single term solutions correspond to the bases 1, 2, 3, and 5. That's 5 solutions right there. Okay. 5 down, 3 to go. What about 2 terms? The list is by 1 by 2 with 1 by 1 at Ls by 2. Right. We need i 123 plus by 2, 23 equals 3. Let's try starting with the smallest possible by 1, which is 1. If by 1 was 1, the inequality becomes 123 plus by 2, 23 equals 3, or 1 plus by 2, 23. That simplifies to by 2, 23 equals 2. And by 2 must be greater than or equal to by 1, so by 2 will 2 equals 1. Exactly. So which integers by 2 equals by 2, s plus 1 set of 5 by 2, 23 equals 2. Well, by 2 to 1 works. 123 equals 1 is 2. So the list 1, 1 is the solution. Its sum is 1 plus 1, 2. By 2 equals 2 works. 223 is about 1.587, which is up close to 2. So the list 1, 2 is another solution. Its sum is about 1 plus 1.587, which is greater than 2. So no more solutions 1 and 1, 1. Okay, so 1 and 1, 2. Are there any others? What if by 1 is bigger than 1? Let's try by 1 equals 2. We need 223 plus by 2, 23. We know 223 is about 1.587. So 1.587 plus by 2, 23. That means by 2, 23. That means by 2, 23 equals 1.583, which is about 1.413. And we need by 2, by 1, so by 2 equals 2. Right. Is there any integer by 2 equals 2 such that by 2, 23 is less than or equal to 1.413? Well, no, even 223 itself is already too big, 1.587. So no solutions start with 1, 2 or anything larger. Ah, I see. So the only two-term solutions are 1 and 1 and 1 and 2. That makes two solutions. Correct. So five single-term plus two two-term, that's seven. We need one more. Must be a three-term solution then. By 1, by 2, by 3 with 1, by 1, by 2, by 2 equals by 3. Yes. We need i 123 plus by 2, 23 plus by 3, 23. The smallest possible value for each psi is 1. So 123, 1. What if 8, 1, by 2, 1, by 3, 1? The sum is 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 to 3. Is that 3? Yes, it is. So 1, 1, 1 is our 8th solution. Can there be any others with three terms? Well, if we tried to increase any of the psi values, say by 1, 1, by 2, 1, by 3, 2, the sum becomes 1 plus 1 plus 223, which is 2 plus 1.587. Clearly bigger than 3. Any other combination will also be too large. Just 1, 1, 1, 1. Just 1, 1, 1. And that gives us our total. 5 plus 2 plus 1 equals 8 solutions for a3. Got it. That makes the definition concrete, but it still feels, well, a bit arbitrary. Why 23? Where did this specific way of counting come from? Ah, now that's where the story gets really interesting. We turn to that Agarwala and Oluk paper from 1951. It provides crucial historical context. See, the study of partitions, you know, going back to Euler and then Hardy and Ramanujan, it started as pure number theory. Right. Just counting ways to break up integers. Exactly. But then, around the mid-20th century, physicists and mathematicians started realizing that the mathematics of partitions was actually incredibly relevant to problems in physics. Specifically, statistical mechanics. Statistical mechanics, like thermodynamics, dealing with large systems of particles. Precisely. Think about atoms, molecules, energy levels. The Agarwala and Oluk paper mentions work by Bohr and Kalkar, who were pioneers in using partition theory to estimate something quite physical. The density of energy levels in heavy atomic nuclei. How does that work? How do integer partitions relate to energy levels? Well, in quantum mechanics, energy often comes in discrete packets or levels. So if you have a total amount of energy in a system, like a nucleus, the number of ways you can distribute that energy among the available levels or components, that looks a lot like partitioning an integer. Counting the partitions gives you a way to estimate the number of possible states, the density of states. I see. So the mathematical structure fit the physical problem. It did. And this sort of physical approach, as they called it, led researchers like Oluk and Kothari to explore the connection further. They started looking at statistical systems or assemblies that naturally corresponded to known partition functions. And then they asked the natural next question. What if we generalize partitions? What if the parts or the rules for combining them aren't just simple integer sums? And that's where the non-integral powers came in. That's exactly where Agarwala and Oluk identified this specific generalization partitions into non-integral powers of integers as an interesting extension arising from thinking about these physical models. The 23 power
