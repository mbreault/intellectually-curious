Learn about OEIS A000097

## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. You know, it's a goldmine for anyone interested in math, especially the patterns hidden within numbers. Today we're going to be looking at sequence A000097, and it's a fascinating one. Oh, it is fascinating. It might seem a bit peculiar when you first see it, but I think you'll find it draws you in. I'm ready to be drawn in. So, what is the definition we are working with today? Well, A000097 is defined as the number of partitions of n if there are two kinds of ones and two kinds of twos. Okay, now we've talked about partitions before, breaking a number down into smaller numbers that add up to the original, but what's this about two kinds of ones and twos? Yeah, so think of it this way. Usually we have partitions with just ones and twos. Now imagine we have two different types of each. Let's call them one and one, two and two fenne. This twist really changes the possibilities. So instead of just say two plus one plus one, we could also have two plus one plus one, or two plus one plus one. You got it. And A000097 counts all these different partitions for each number n using the special rule. Can you give me a specific example, just to make it a little clearer? Absolutely. Let's say n is three. With two types of ones and twos, we get nine distinct partitions. Three, two plus one, two plus one point, two plus one, plus one, one plus one, plus one plus one, plus one plus one, plus one plus one, and one plus one, plus one plus one. And one plus one, plus one plus one. So A000097 for n equals three is nine. Wow. Nine ways to partition just the number three. Okay, this is getting interesting. But what makes this sequence stand out from all the others in the OEIS? Well, one thing is it has other interpretations. It's not only about counting partitions with different types of ones and twos. Oh, really? I'm curious now. What are some of these other interpretations? Okay, well, one way to think about it is through transitions. Between partitions of n plus two, you can replace two parts of a partition with their sum. That's a transition. A000097 counts these transitions. Wait, how could a sequence about partitions with two types of ones and twos be related to transitions between different partitions? I know it's not obvious, but the math works out. Think of it like this. Each of those different types of ones and twos allows for a different way to make a transition. It's a subtle but powerful connection. Okay, that is a lot to process. Are there any other ways to think about this sequence? Yes, and they get even more interesting. So A000097 also represents the number of pairs of partitions of n plus two that differ by just one box. You can visualize it. Imagine a picture of the partitions where each number is a row of boxes. Some pairs of partitions will only have a single box difference. So the sequence is counting how many of these nearly identical twin partitions exist for n plus two. Yes, exactly. That is a really cool way to think about it. And there's more. A000097 also counts partitions of n with two marked parts. Partitions of 2m plus 1 with an alternating sum of 2. And even the number of edges in a distance graph of partitions of n. Hold on, you said a distance graph. Like a map of partitions where their distances measured mathematically. You're on the right track. We'll get into that more later. Okay, now I am hooked. It's amazing how one sequence can have so many different meanings. I'm ready to unpack all of this and see what other secrets A000097 holds. Trust me, there is much more to discover. Okay, so before we get to the distance graphs, you mentioned some formulas connected to A000097. What can we learn from them? Well, these formulas give us different ways to look at and understand the sequence. We have the Euler transform, generating functions, and recurrence relations. Each one offers a different perspective. Okay, let's start with the Euler transform. What is that, and how does it relate to our sequence? The Euler transform is a tool that lets us change sequences. So when you apply it to A000097, it connects it to a simpler sequence. 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, and so on. So this complicated sequence with all these interpretations is connected to a repeating pattern. Yes, it shows how complex things can be made from simpler parts. Amazing. Now, what about generating functions? You talked about them before. Right, generating functions can represent a whole sequence in one math expression, like the sequence's DNA in a formula. For A000097, the generating function is an infinite product, which hints at its complex structure. I see. So if we study the generating function, we can learn more about the sequence, like its patterns and properties. That's right, like having a blueprint of the sequence. And you mentioned recurrence relations too. What are those? Well, recurrence relations show you how to calculate a term based on the terms before it. They're like a recipe for the sequence. Oh, so instead of going back to the definition and counting partitions every time, we can use these relations to quickly calculate the terms. Yes, exactly. Recurrence relations are very efficient, and they reveal the patterns within the sequence itself. So of all these interpretations, which one do you find the most interesting? Hmm, it's hard to choose just one. But the one with the distance graph, that one is really mind-blowing. It's a perfect example of how different areas of math can connect in unexpected ways. Okay, so let's talk about that distance graph. What is it exactly? So think of a network. Each point is a partition of n. The distance between them is determined by a special function. It's defined in another OEIS sequence, A366156. This function measures how different two partitions are by looking at the sizes of their parts. So it's not real distance, but a measure of how different the partitions are. Exactly, and here's the cool part. If we connect partitions that are a distance of two apart, the number of connections in the graph corresponds to A000097. Wow, that is an incredible connection. This idea of distance between partitions is reflected in our sequence. And it raises more questions, like why is the distance of two so important? What happens if we change the distance? There's a lot to explore here, and it shows how math is all connected. I feel like we've only just started with A000097. We went from a simple definition to all these different interpretations, formulas, and even graph theory. You're right. This is just the beginning. Each connection opens up new things to explore. It's clear that this sequence, like many in the OEIS, opens up a whole world of math. It's exciting to think about what we might discover next. It is. That's the beauty of the OEIS. Always more to learn and explore in math. You know, it really is amazing that all of this complexity comes from such a simple definition about partitions with two types of ones and twos. That's what I love about the OEIS. You start with something simple and end up down a rabbit hole of math connections. I think some of our listeners might be feeling a little lost with all this complex math, but I want to assure you, you don't need a PhD to appreciate this stuff. Yeah, you can appreciate it on different levels. Even if you don't understand all the formulas, you can still see how beautiful it is, all the different interpretations, and how it all connects together. I like that. Before we finish up with A000097, I want to go back to the distance graph. You mentioned that the distance function is defined in another OEIS sequence, A366156. Can you tell us a bit more about how this distance function works? Okay, so it's a little technical, but basically it compares the sizes of the parts in two partitions. For example, let's take the partitions 3 plus 2 and 2 plus 2 plus 1. The distance function looks at the differences in the sizes of those parts. It gives us a way to measure how far apart the partitions are. So it's like comparing two recipes based on how many ingredients they share. Yeah, that's a great way to think about it. The more ingredients in common, the closer the recipes are, the smaller their distance. And then we build a graph using this distance function and connect partitions that are a distance of two apart. And the number of connections matches A000097. Exactly. It's a crazy connection between the idea of distance and the numbers in our sequence. It makes me wonder, why is the distance of two so special? What if we tried different distances? Does the sequence still show up? I bet mathematicians are still working on that. Oh, definitely. There's so much more to discover. So to wrap up, what's the main thing you want our listeners to take away about A000097? I think the biggest takeaway is how deep and interconnected math really is. This one simple sequence leads to so many different things, different interpretations, formulas, and even connections to graph theory. It shows that even in numbers, there's a hidden order. Exactly. And the OEIS lets us see that. Well said. As we finish up our deep dive into A000097, I encourage everyone to go to the OEIS website and check out this sequence for yourselves. You might be surprised by what you find. Who knows? You might even start your own math journey. That's a great point. That's all the time we have for today. Until next time, keep exploring the OEIS. Keep diving deep into
