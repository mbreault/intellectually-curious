## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone, to our deep dive into the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. We're continuing to explore all the really fascinating connections that these sequences have across math. Yeah, it's always amazing to me how these really simple patterns can unlock really complex math ideas. Absolutely. So today we're going to focus on sequence A00096. It's defined by this formula, A of n equals n times n plus 3 divided by 2. And, you know, might not look like much at first glance. Yeah, but as we get deeper into it, you'll see just how much the sequence can really do. I'm excited. So, okay, let's break down this formula. A of n equals n times n plus 3 divided by 2. What kind of sequence does this actually give us? Well, if we just plug in the first few values of n, starting with 0, we get 0, 2, 5, 9, 14, 20, and it just keeps going. Each term is, you know, the result of plugging in the corresponding value of n into the formula. Gotcha. So it's just a sequence that grows steadily. But here's where it gets really interesting. The OEIS website lists one of the first applications of A00096 as cutting an annulus. Now, for those who may not know, an annulus is basically a donut shape. That's right. And what's really cool is that this sequence tells you the maximum number of pieces that you can get by slicing a donut with n cuts. Wait, so there's a formula for how to cut a donut into the most pieces? Like that just seems counterintuitive. It might seem that way, but think about it visually. You know, you can imagine drawing lines across the donut and each new line can intersect all the previous lines. And those intersections create more pieces. And the formula captures how that intersecting maximizes the number of pieces that you can get. Okay, so let me make sure I'm understanding this. So if I make like three cuts across a donut, the maximum number of pieces that I could get is, okay, plugging in three to the formula. We get three times the quantity 3 plus 3 divided by 2, which is nine pieces. Exactly. And you know, if you go to the OEIS website, they actually have a visual representation of this. It's surprisingly intuitive when you see it. That's awesome. I love when things are visualized. Okay, so we've talked about donuts. What else does this sequence pop up in? The OEIS lists a ton of other applications for A00096. Well, let's go from donuts to something a bit more familiar geometrically speaking, diagonals of a polygon. Diagonals. Okay, so those are the lines that connect non-adjacent vertices of the polygon. So how does this sequence connect to that? With a slight tweak to our formula, A00096 gives us the number of diagonals in any polygon. Instead of n times n plus 3 over 2, we use n times n minus 3 over 2. Gotcha. So if I have a pentagon which has five sides, I plug five into our modified formula, and that gives me 5 times the quantity 5 minus 3 divided by 2, which equals five diagonals. Exactly. You can verify this yourself if you want by just drawing a pentagon and counting the diagonals. Same underlying sequence, just a slight adjustment, and we can solve this completely different geometric problem. Interesting. It just goes to show that seemingly different math concepts can share these really unexpected underlying structures. Okay, what else can A00096 do? I'm ready for another challenge. Let's step into the world of polyominoes. Think of them as generalizations of dominoes. Ah, okay, so like those little rectangular tiles. Yes, but a polyomino can be any shape formed by connecting squares edge to edge. A good visual is Tetris pieces. Those are polyominoes. Okay, I'm picturing it. So how does this sequence fit into the world of Tetris shapes? There's this special type of polyomino called a prime polyomino, and a prime polyomino can't be formed by sticking together smaller polyominoes. The only exception is a single square, of course. So a single square is a prime polyomino, but if it's made up of two or more squares, it's not. Exactly. And get this, A00096 gives us the number of prime n-dimensional polyominoes. It's wild how this simple formula can handle such a complex combinatorial idea. So you're saying there's a connection between how many squares make up a shape and whether it's prime. That's fascinating. I'm really starting to see how this one sequence can pop up in so many different parts of math. And we've only just begun. It also has applications in game theory. Oh, okay, what kind of game? Well, it can help us calculate the number of possible checkmate positions in chess, the number of ways to checkmate with a king and rook versus just a lone king. There's a formula for figuring that out that's really cool. There is. On an n by n chessboard, the number of checkmate positions is 8 times a of n minus 2, where a refers to our sequence. The 8 accounts for rotations and reflections of the board, and the a of n minus 2 part reflects the shrinking space the lone king has to move in before being trapped. So on a standard 8 by 8 chessboard, that would be 8 times a of 6. Let me see, that's 216 different checkmate positions? Exactly, and that includes all the rotations and reflections of the board. I never realized there was so much math hidden in a game of chess. Yeah. What else can A00096 do? Let's shift gears to binomial coefficients. You probably remember them from high school, the numbers in Pascal's triangle. Binomial coefficients, yeah, combinations. So how does A00096 connect to Pascal's triangle? It can help us identify sets of three consecutive binomial coefficients that form an arithmetic progression, meaning they increase by a constant difference. So if I'm looking at a row in Pascal's triangle, A00096 can help me find those instances where three numbers in a row have the same difference between them. Precisely. Any such arithmetic progression in Pascal's triangle is linked to our sequence A00096. Hold on, so we've got donuts, polygons, tetrasheps, chess, and now Pascal's triangle all connected to this one sequence. It's amazing how much ground A00096 covers. And we're really just scratching the surface. There are many more applications and connections to explore with this sequence. Yeah, it really is remarkable how one sequence can just weave its way through so many different parts of math. It really is. It's like A00096 is this hidden thread connecting everything. So what else does this sequence have in store for us? Well, let's shift our focus to something you might find in computer science. Rooted trees. Rooted trees. Are those like those family trees with branches that represent relationships? Yeah, you can kind of think of it like that. In math, a rooted tree is a hierarchical structure, like a family tree. It has a root node that branches out into child nodes, and those can branch out even further. Okay, I'm picturing it. So how does A00096 connect to these math trees? It turns out that A00096 can enumerate certain types of rooted trees. Imagine a tree where only the leaf nodes have a valence of 1, meaning they have one connection. And let's say there are exactly two other nodes in the tree that branch out. Well, A00096 tells us how many different ways we can structure these types of trees. So it's like A00096 is giving us a blueprint for building these very specific trees. That's really interesting. Exactly. And this is a recurring theme with A00096. It just shows up in these unexpected places. Let's move from trees to sets. Okay. How does A00096 relate to sets? Okay, so imagine you have a set with n elements, and you pick a specific subset with two elements. A00096 can tell you how many subsets of size n-2 exist that have at least one element in common with your two-element subset. Let me see if I've got this. So if I have a set of five elements, and I pick two, A00096 can tell me how many three-element subsets will share at least one of the two elements I chose. Precisely. Like it's a way of quantifying the overlap between subsets. That's pretty cool. So from donuts to trees to sets, A00096 can quantify things. What else can it do? Let's talk about permutations, which are basically ways to arrange a set of objects in a specific order. Oh, yeah, okay. I remember permutations from math class. How does our sequence fit into this? Well, A00096 counts something called distinct shuffles. Imagine you're shuffling two sets of playing cards, one with n plus 1 cards and the other with just 2. You're interleaving them, but there are some rules about how you do it. And the number of distinct shuffles you can create is given by A00096. So it's like a very particular way of shuffling cards. Exactly. It's a bit technical, but the key is that A00096 gives us a way to quantify the ways to combine these two sets of cards. That's pretty neat. It's crazy how this simple sequence connects to such a specific concept. There's more, right? Oh, yeah, absolutely. This is just the beginning. Remember when we talked about sequences where each term is defined by the previous term? Recursively defined sequences? Yeah, I remember that, like a chain where each link depends on the one before
