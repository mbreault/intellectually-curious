## Transcript

Hey everyone, ready for a deep dive into a real head-scratcher? We're tackling the monkey and the coconuts problem today. Oh yeah, classic. Five sailors, a monkey, and a pile of coconuts that keep dividing up. You think it's simple, but... It's anything but. Yeah. Figuring out how many coconuts they started with? Well, let's just say it's tougher than it sounds. Deceptively tricky, that's math for you. Right. And it's been around forever. Lewis Carroll even wrote about it in his diaries. And in tons of old math textbooks. Oh, and remember that Saturday Evening Post story? The one where readers demanded the solution. Practically rioted. But before we crack this coconut, can you explain the two versions of the problem? The original and the one Ben Ames Williams made famous? Ah, good point. So the original, the really old one, the monkey gets a coconut, even in the very last division. Yeah. Williams, he changed it up. His version has the sailors splitting the pile evenly in the morning, no leftovers for the monkey. Hmm. Seems like a small change. It is, but it makes the problem a whole lot harder to solve. Gotcha. So, we've got our sailors, coconuts, a monkey who likes his share, and this little twist that really ramps up the difficulty. Absolutely. But how does all this connect to something called Diophantine analysis? That sounds pretty intimidating. Ha ha, it does, doesn't it? But think of it like building with Legos, but you've got to use whole bricks, no cutting allowed. I like that analogy. So, Diophantine analysis. We're looking for solutions to equations, but the answers have to be whole numbers. So, no fractions of coconuts allowed. Exactly. And in this coconut problem, the unknowns are, well, the original number of coconuts, right? And then how many each sailor gets in the final split. Makes sense. We've only got one equation for all the dividing and subtracting. So, that whole numbers-only rule is key. It is. It helps us narrow down the possibilities. Like a missing puzzle piece, but you know it's got to fit a specific shape. A whole number shape, you got it. Now, there are a bunch of ways to actually solve this coconut puzzle. Some more intimidating than others, I bet. Maybe a little, but they each have their own charm. There's trial and error, of course. The brute force method. You could say that. It works with the original version, the one where the monkey gets the coconut at the very end. Okay. You just keep guessing numbers until you find one that, you know, fits the pattern. But for Williams' version. Oh, you'd be guessing for ages. So, trial and error shows us how tricky this problem is. It does. But it's not really a practical solution for the one we're interested in. What about this sieve method? I've heard that one's kind of clever. The sieve. It's all about narrowing things down strategically. Like sifting flour, you know, to get rid of the lumps. Okay. We know that final number of coconuts each sailor gets, that's got to be divisible by five, right? Right. So we start there and work backwards. Keeping in mind the monkey's coconut. The repeated divisions. Anything that doesn't fit the divisibility rules, well, we toss it out. So no more blind guessing. Exactly. Logic and divisibility rules help us zero in. Now, this blue coconuts approach, that one's got me curious. The name itself sounds, well, fun. That one's all about making it visual, easier to wrap your head around. Imagine we add four extra coconuts, blue ones, to the original pile. Blue coconuts, okay. Each sailor, when they divide the pile, makes sure each blue coconut ends up in a different pile. They take the pile without the blue ones, all combined back together. So those blue ones, they're like placeholders. Exactly. To make the divisions work out neatly. And since the whole pile with the blue coconuts was divided evenly five times, we know it had to be a multiple of five to the fifth power. Okay. Subtract those four blue coconuts and boom, we have our original number. Okay. I'm starting to see how these different approaches can really unlock this problem. Each one sheds light on a different aspect. But before we get too deep into the math weeds, I got to admit, base five numbering and modulo congruence, those sound a little intimidating. I can see why, but they're not as scary as they sound, I promise. Let's hope so. Take base five. It might seem weird, but it makes perfect sense for this problem. How so? Every time those sailors divide the coconuts, it's all about groups of five, right? So if we use a number system where each digit represents a power of five, things get a lot simpler. Instead of fighting the divisions by five, we embrace it. You got it. We start speaking the problem's language. Pretty clever. And modulo congruence. That helps us analyze the remainders after each division. Each sailor gives a coconut to the monkey, right? Yeah. So the remaining pile, it's always going to be one less than a multiple of five. I see a pattern. A pattern that modulo congruence can express mathematically. We're looking for a number that, after all that dividing by five, always leaves a remainder of four. Okay. I think I'm starting to get it. It helps us see the problem's structure and often a solution that wasn't obvious at first. This is fascinating. We've gone from trial and error to imagining blue coconuts to different number systems and remainders. And I hear there's even more advanced stuff, like Diophantine equations. Oh, yes. And the Euclidean algorithm. Maybe those deserve a deep dive all their own. They certainly do. Another time, perhaps. But for now, I think we've got a good foundation for understanding this classic coconut problem. Definitely a good starting point. And there's always more to explore. There always is. But you know what I'm really curious about? A generalized solution. Like, is there a formula that works for any number of sailors? Not just five. Ah, now you're talking. That takes us even deeper into the heart of number theory. I'm ready if you are. We'll tackle that in part two, so stay tuned. Back again for more coconut craziness. I'm still trying to wrap my head around all the different ways to solve this problem. It is a lot to take in. But now I'm really hooked on this idea of a generalized solution. Can we actually find a formula that works for any number of sailors? Not just five. We can. And that's where things get really interesting. It's like we've climbed to the top of that coconut tree and now we see the whole mathematical landscape. Ooh, I like that. But how do we even start making a formula that works for, you know, an infinite number of sailors? By looking for patterns, just like we did with the five-sailor case. Instead of using the specific number five, we imagine we have, let's say, sailors. For mystery sailors. Uh-huh, sure. Each sailor does the same thing. Dividing into m piles, giving one to the monkey, hiding their share, the whole routine. So instead of those powers of five we talked about, now we're dealing with powers of them. Exactly. And if we follow the same logic as the five-sailor version, but swap m everywhere, we get something called a recurrence relation. Recurrence relation, that sounds... It basically describes how the number of coconuts changes after each sailor takes their turn. Okay, so we've made it more general by using m instead of a fixed number. But how do we go from a recurrence relation, which is like a step-by-step recipe... To an actual formula for the starting number of coconuts. Good question. It involves a bit of, well, careful unpacking of that relation, applying it m times for all the sailors. Sounds complicated. It leads to a rather long expression, but thankfully it simplifies quite nicely. Math magic to the rescue. So what does this simplified, generalized formula look like? Once the dust settles, we get a Diophantine equation that connects the original number of coconuts, call it n, the number each sailor gets at the end, we can call that f, and our variable m, the number of sailors. It's actually a pretty elegant equation. Diophantine equation, just like we talked about before. So even with our mystery m sailors, we still need whole number solutions. No coconut fractions. Absolutely. And the beauty of this equation is that we can use some, let's say, clever number theory tools to find solutions for any value of m. So we can plug in any number of sailors and find a solution. That's amazing. It's like having a master key that unlocks, well, an infinite number of coconut puzzles. Okay, my mind is officially blown. From a specific puzzle to a formula for any number of sailors. Do you have an example of how this works in action? Sure. Let's imagine just three sailors instead of five. Our generalized equation will give us conditions that the solutions must meet. We can then use those to find the smallest possible starting pile for three sailors and, of course, the monkey. So we're not limited to five anymore. We can solve this for a whole pirate crew. Exactly. But hold on, you mentioned clever number theory tools. Can you tell me more about those? Uh, yes. Remember modulo congruence? Looking at remainders? That's one tool that's super useful here. It helps pinpoint specific solutions that fit our equation.
