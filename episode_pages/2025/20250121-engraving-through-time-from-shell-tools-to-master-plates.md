## Description

Travel back to the dawn of engravingâ€”from a shell tool in Indonesia 540,000 years ago to decorated ostrich eggshells in 60,000 BCâ€”and follow how the craft moved from practical ornament to fine art. Weâ€™ll explore techniques, key figures, and the rise of old master prints, the golden age of line engraving, and the shift to etching, book illustration, and music engraving, up to todayâ€™s CNC and laser methods. Itâ€™s a story about artistry, function, and the human urge to leave a mark.

## Transcript

Welcome to the deep dive. Today we're going deep, really deep into the world of engraving. Oh, this is going to be fun. I think so too. Yeah. So for our listeners out there who are interested in the history of engraving, we've got a really cool mix of sources for you. Oh, cool. We've got encyclopedia entries, timelines, even some biblical references, believe it or not. Oh. We're going to cover it all. I'm excited. And you know what's really amazing is that the earliest evidence of engraving, it's not from some like, you know, Renaissance artist or something like that. Right. It's actually a shell tool from Indonesia. Really? Dating back over 500,000 years. Wow. That's right. 540,000 years ago, somebody was already etching patterns. I mean, that is just incredible. Makes you wonder what they were thinking, doesn't it? It really does spark the imagination. And you know, that early engraving wasn't just a one-off. Right. If we jump ahead a little bit, you know, a few thousand years to 60,000 BC, we find ostrich eggshells in South Africa that are decorated with engraved patterns. And they were using these shells as water containers, but they still felt compelled to embellish them. So they were practical, but they were also... Beautiful. Beautiful. Exactly. Yeah, it speaks to this human desire to create, I think, to personalize even practical objects. To personalize. It's like they were saying, hey, even our water containers can be beautiful. Exactly. But when we think about ancient jewelry and all those intricate designs... Right. Were those really engraved? That's a great question. Yeah. And a lot of those ancient designs weren't actually engraved. They were created by chasing or casting. Okay. Not by cutting into the metal. Okay. True engraving on metal emerged a little bit later. Okay. We start seeing shallow grooves on jewelry around the first millennium BC. Okay. But it really wasn't until the first century AD that glass engraving really takes off. Glass engraving, yeah, particularly in like decorating vessels. So those stunning engraved glass vessels that you see in museums... Right. They were like the canvas for early engravers. You could say that they were using wheels for cutting at this point, which allowed for greater precision than hand tools. Right. And the designs were fascinating. I bet. Early on, you see a lot of Greek mythology reflecting the cultural influences of the time. Makes sense. Yeah. But later on, you see scenes of hunting. You see circus spectacles. You even see biblical imagery. Wow. It's like a visual record of their lives and beliefs. It makes you wonder, like if those vessels were just for, you know, everyday use... Right. Or if they had a special significance because of the engravings. That's a question worth pondering for sure. Yeah. And it speaks to a broader theme we see throughout the history of engraving, this interplay between artistry and functionality, you know? Right. Sometimes the lines blur. Yeah. Take, for instance, the role of medieval goldsmiths. Okay. Goldsmiths? Right. They were decorating metalwork, obviously, but they were also using engravings to record their designs, almost like blueprints. So they were like the original design files. Exactly. And it was a revolutionary step, really. This ability to record designs allowed for greater consistency. They were able to reproduce these designs accurately and potentially even share ideas with other goldsmiths. Ah, that's interesting. Yeah. It's a crucial link to what we now call old master prints, which emerged in the 1430s when we start seeing engraved copper plates that were specifically being used for creating images on paper. Germany kind of took the lead with this, and Italy followed closely behind. So now we're entering what's considered the golden age of engraving. Right. The 1470s to the 1530s, right? Exactly. This is where names like Martin Schongauer, Albrecht DÃ¼rer... Oh, yeah. Absolutely. These artists were masters of their craft. Right. DÃ¼rer, in particular, was a pioneer in using line engraving to explore perspective and anatomy. He was really pushing the boundaries of what was possible. Yeah. And what's interesting is that even music was being printed from engraved plates. Music? Yeah. As early as 1446. Wow. Music engraving. Yeah. So that predates sheet music as we know it, right? Right. But I'm curious, like, what kind of technical innovations were happening during this golden age of engraving? Well, there are several. Yeah. One that stands out is the introduction of stippling. Stippling. Around 1505 by Giulio Campagnola. Stippling. What is that exactly? So stippling involves using dots rather than lines to create tonal effects. So it gives a softer, more nuanced effect. So instead of lines? Yeah. Imagine creating a portrait, right? Okay. Not with lines, but with thousands of tiny dots. Wow. Each carefully placed to suggest light and shadow. That's incredible. That is pretty amazing. It seems like even within the limitations of line engraving, there was still so much room for artistic expression. Absolutely. A great example is Claude Mellan. Okay. He was a 17th century French engraver, and he created this famous engraving called Sudarium of Saint Veronica. And it's a portrait of Jesus' face, but get this, it's done entirely with a single continuous spiraling line. Wait, a single line? A single line. That's mind-boggling. It is quite remarkable. Yeah. The level of skill and planning involved is astounding. I can imagine. You know, imagine the precision needed to modulate the thickness of that single line to create the illusion of light and shadow. You know, capturing the contours of the face with such nuance. It's like the ultimate test of an engraver's skill. It really is. Pushing the boundaries of what's possible with just one line. Right. I imagine that took a while. It must have, yeah. And speaking of time, didn't etching eventually become a popular alternative to engraving because it was faster? You're right. Yeah. Etching, which uses acid to etch designs into metal plates, was considered simpler and less time-consuming than painstakingly carving everything out with a burin. Right, right. But even then, you know, masters like Rembrandt often combined both engraving and etching in their work. However, as we move into the 19th century, engraving starts to shift away from its purely artistic focus. Okay. And it becomes more about commercial applications. So it went from creating these unique artworks to more of a mass production kind of thing. Precisely. Okay. Think about all the illustrations you see in 19th century books and magazines. Right. Many of them were created using engraving techniques, especially line engraving and steel engraving. Oh, okay. It was a way to reproduce artwork, to create detailed illustrations for publications. Right. And even to produce things like letterheads and banknotes. Okay, yeah. That makes sense. You know, photography wasn't widely used for printing yet. Right. So engraving kind of filled that gap. It did. And I can see why they'd use steel for banknotes. Yeah, durable. Durable, and it could withstand a lot of handling. Yeah, exactly. But did that shift towards commercial use mean the end of artistic engraving? Not at all. Hand engraving found a niche in specific fields where people valued that unique handcrafted touch. You know, think firearms, jewelry, silverware, things like that. Right. And in the mid-20th century, there was actually a revival of hand engraving. Oh, really? Yeah, thanks to pneumatic systems. Okay. These systems made the process less physically demanding, so less strain on the engraver's hands. That makes sense. Right. And that opened it up to more people. Right. So less strain on the hands, good for the engraver. Yeah. But what about, you know, the newer technologies like CNC and laser engraving? Yeah. Have they completely replaced traditional hand engraving? They certainly have their place in modern manufacturing, especially for mass production. Right. They're faster, they're more efficient. Right. But hand engraving still holds a special place, particularly for intricate work. Right. Where that human touch and artistry are paramount. It's like comparing a mass-produced piece of furniture to a handcrafted heirloom. Right. Both serve a purpose, but the heirloom carries a different kind of value. Absolutely. There's a soulfulness to those handcrafted items that you just don't get with mass production. I agree. But you know what? We haven't talked about music engraving yet. That's right. I'm really curious about how that evolved over time. That is a fascinating story. Yeah. Remember how we mentioned the first printed music from engraved plates dates back to 1446? I do. Well, that was just the beginning. It became the dominant way to produce printed music from around 1700 to 1860. Wow. Imagine those engravers meticulously carving tiny notes, staff lines, intricate details, all with specialized tools. I'm picturing them all hunched over these plates, painstakingly carving each note. Yeah. They must have been incredibly skilled. They were true artisans. Yeah. They had five-pointed rasters for the staff lines, punches for different note shapes, and specialized burrins for finer details. And if they made a mistake, they couldn't just hit undo. Right. They would have to use a dot punch and burnish the plate to smooth out the error. The pressure must have been immense. It must have been. It's like they were writing music with a metal pen, and it must have taken years to master that level of precision. And what about those huge musical scores? Did they engrave those onto giant plates? Not quite. Okay. They typically engraved four
