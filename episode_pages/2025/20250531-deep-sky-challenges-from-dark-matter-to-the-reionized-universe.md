## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. Today we're heading out into the cosmos. For a science corner deep dive, we're tackling what we're calling deep sky challenges. Galaxies, cosmology, and reionization. It's quite a topic. We're really looking at the immense challenge of figuring out how everything went from, well, the fairly smooth early universe to the complex web of galaxies we see now. Exactly. And we've got some great material guiding us. A detailed review on cosmic star formation, brand new findings from JWST surveys like JADE's and Pearls, and insights into the core physics involved. Our goal here really is to explore these hurdles. We'll touch on the tools we use, the observational methods, the theoretical puzzles that frankly keep us up at night. I bet. And crucially, what the newest discoveries, especially from JWST, are telling us about the universe's infancy and that key event, reionization. Okay, let's dive in. You said it's a challenge. A big part of that seems to be how we model the universe. We've gotten really good at simulating dark matter, haven't we? The invisible stuff. Oh, absolutely. N-body simulations, they're fantastic. They really nail how dark matter collapses under gravity to form these halos, which are like the scaffolds for galaxies. Right. But when you try to add the normal matter, the baryons, you know, gas, stars, the things we actually see, well, it gets orders of magnitude more complex. So the visible stuff is the tricky part. Why? What makes those baryonic processes so hard to simulate accurately? It's just the physics is so much more intricate than gravity alone. You've got gas cooling down inside these dark matter halos. That's baryonic dissipation. So it's messy, turbulent. Okay. Then how does that cold gas actually condense to form stars? That depends on local density, temperature, things we often can't resolve in big simulations. Right. And forming actual structure, like spinning disks or those more rounded spheroids, another layer of complexity. Plus you have stars creating heavier elements, metals, and spreading them around the galaxy and even between galaxies. Chemical enrichment. So it's not just gravity pulling things together. It's all these localized, complex interactions. Exactly. And that brings us to a really critical idea, feedback. Feedback. Energy getting pumped back out into the system. Precisely. Think about massive stars exploding as supernovae or material spiraling into a central massive black hole. These events release tremendous energy. That energy heats gas, pushes it around, can even blow it right out of the galaxy, these galactic outflows we talk about. And this feedback is absolutely crucial because it regulates star formation. It stops everything from just collapsing into stars all at once. Okay, so if we can't simulate every star, every gas cloud, how do the big theoretical models handle this feedback? Well, that's where we rely on what's often called phenomenological treatment or more commonly subgrid modeling. Subgrid. Meaning below the resolution of the simulation. Exactly. In these huge cosmological simulations, you just can't resolve the tiny scales where feedback happens around a single supernova near a black hole. So we have to put in simplified rules, kind of like recipes. Like if this happens, then assume that effect occurs. Sort of, yeah. You insert rules that try to capture the net effect of that small scale physics on the larger simulation grid. But the challenge is these subgrid models rely on parameters that are, well, poorly determined, as the review puts it. We don't always know the exact strength or efficiency of these processes from first principles. And different assumptions give different results. They can, yes. And sometimes you have degeneracies. Different combinations of parameters might produce similar looking galaxies, making it really hard to figure out which physical process is truly dominant. I understand this leads to some classic problems in simulations, like the overcooling problem. It's a textbook example. If your feedback isn't strong enough or implemented correctly, the simulations predict gas cools way too efficiently, forms far too many stars, especially early on. You end up with galaxies that are just too massive compared to what we actually observe. Getting feedback right across all scales is, well, it's a persistent headache. Okay, so if simulating individual galaxies in detail is so tough, how do we actually piece together the history of star formation for the whole universe? That's where we often switch tactics. Instead of getting bogged down in simulating every single galaxy perfectly, we take a more empirical approach. We look at the integrated light, the total emission from the entire population of galaxies across cosmic time. By looking at different distances, effectively looking back in time. Precisely. We observe galaxies at various redshifts, which correspond to different epochs, and measure their combined light output. And different wavelengths tell you different things, right? UV versus infrared. Absolutely crucial. UV light typically traces young, hot, massive stars, so it's a direct probe of ongoing star formation. But dust, always dust. Especially at higher redshifts, galaxies can be incredibly dusty. Dust absorbs that UV light and re-radiates in the infrared. So if you only look in the UV... You miss a lot of the star formation. You can underestimate it massively. So we use techniques to correct for this. We look at the slope of the UV spectrum, or we compare the far infrared light to the far UV light to gauge how much energy was absorbed and re-emitted. Think of it like trying to see through smoke. Makes sense. And just finding a tipple patch of sky is also a challenge. Cosmic variance, you mentioned. Yes, cosmic variance is a big one. Our deepest surveys, like the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, are amazing but cover tiny areas. You might happen to point your telescope at a region that's unusually dense or unusually empty, just by chance. Skewing the average. Exactly. Especially at high redshift when structures were disforming. Wider surveys, like Cosmos, cover much larger volumes, so they average out these variations better, but they're usually not as deep. We saw this early on. Differences between the Hubble Deep Field North and South showed this effect quite clearly. Right. Despite these difficulties, though, observations have converged on a pretty consistent picture of the overall cosmic star formation history, haven't they? What does that look like? Yes, there's broad agreement. The universe's star formation rate seems to have increased rapidly at early times, maybe scaling something like inverse time cubed between redshift 8 and 3. It then hit a peak. Cosmic noon. Cosmic noon, exactly. Between redshift 1.5 and 2, when the universe was about 3.5 billion years old, that's when star formation was most intense across the universe. After that peak, it's been gradually declining down to the present day. Interesting. What's maybe a bit surprising is that the rate of star formation back at redshift 7 was roughly the same as it is locally today. Different kinds of galaxies dominating, perhaps, but a similar overall rate per volume. And how much stellar mass had actually built up by then? Well, the total stellar mass density, all the stars packed into a given volume, has obviously been growing over time. It looks like it reached about half of its current value somewhere between redshift 2 and 1. So relatively recently in cosmic terms? Relatively, yes. And looking back further, maybe only about 1% of all the stellar mass we see around us today was actually formed before redshift 6. It really emphasizes how much galaxy growth happened after the very earliest epochs. And we can also track the buildup of heavier elements, the metals. We can. We look at the cosmic metallicity. At redshift 2.5, the average metallicity of the universe was maybe only 1% of the sun's. Today, it's closer to 9% solar. Interestingly, the total amount of metals produced doesn't seem to depend hugely on exactly what kinds of stars formed first, the initial mass function or IMF. Okay. Now, galaxies don't just have stars. Most massive ones have these supermassive black holes at their centers. How do they fit into this growth picture? Ah, the black holes. There's a fascinating link. Locally, we see this really tight correlation between the mass of the central black hole and properties of the host galaxy's bulge, like the stellar velocity dispersion, the M-sigma relation. Suggesting they grow together somehow. It strongly suggests their growth is coupled. And we can actually try to trace the growth history of these black holes across cosmic time, too. How do you do that? You can't just weigh them directly at cosmic distances. No, but we can use something called Sultan's argument. It's quite clever. It basically relates the total light emitted by actively growing black holes, seen as quasars, over all of cosmic history, to the total mass that must have been accreted onto them. You sum up all the light to figure out the total fuel burned, essentially. I see. And how does that history compare to the star formation history? Well, this is where it gets really compelling. The derived growth rate for black holes seems to track the cosmic star formation history remarkably well, also peaking around redshift 2. So they peak at the same time. Roughly, yes. It suggests star formation and black hole growth are closely linked processes, perhaps feeding each other in some way across most of cosmic time. Though I should add there are still some differences between various studies trying to measure this black hole accretion history, so it's not completely settled. But the indication is strong. Coordinated growth. That's the feeling. And remember feedback. The immense energy released when black holes are actively feeding the quasar phase, that's thought to be another major source of feedback. It could drive those galactic outflows we mentioned, maybe even shut down star formation in the host galaxy eventually. Connecting
