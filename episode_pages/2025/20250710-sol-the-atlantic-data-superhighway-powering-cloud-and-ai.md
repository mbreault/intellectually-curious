## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive. For those of you who track, you know, the real bones of the internet, hearing about a new subsea cable is always, well, it's a big moment. We talk a lot about the digital age, right? But we rarely look underneath, literally beneath the ocean, to see what makes everything work. Imagine if your apps lag all the time or video calls kept dropping. Yeah, or if AI progress just hit a wall because data couldn't move fast enough. Exactly. So today we're pulling back the curtain on a huge hidden engineering project designed to stop that happening. It's the SOL Transatlantic Cable. That's right. And our mission for this deep dive is really to unpack what SOL is, where does it connect, why is this latest Google Cloud investment under the Atlantic such a big step for, well, everything from streaming movies to developing AI. And what it means for people, for businesses all over the world. This is super timely too because Google Cloud literally just announced this today, July 9th, 2025. Hot off the press. And a little detail, SOL, it means sun in Spanish and Portuguese. Sort of a nod to its landing points in warmer places. It's interesting, isn't it, how these huge sort of abstract global connections, they actually turn into really concrete benefits, things you can feel. We're talking about this massive underwater project, but ultimately it means your cloud apps run faster, your digital life feels smoother. Okay, so let's dig into that. We know SOL is a new transatlantic subsea cable, but what's really new about it compared to other projects? What's its main job? That's a key question. So yes, it's a new cable, but its real distinction is, I think, its strategic connections. SOL is specifically designed to link the US, Bermuda, the Azores, and Spain. That's its main purpose. To seriously boost capacity and crucially reliability for Google's huge global network. And when we say Google's network, we mean over, what, 40 Google Cloud regions worldwide? Wow. Yeah, like massive digital hubs processing just tons of data. So SOL is like a major new superhighway connecting key spots. It helps data travel incredibly fast to meet that rocketing demand for Google Cloud and AI services across the US, Europe, everywhere. And it's worth mentioning too, the whole cable's being made right here in the US. So clearly a big jump in just raw capacity. But like you said, the world already has a lot of cables crisscrossing the ocean floor. What's the strategic thinking behind SOL? Is it part of a bigger plan for like network resilience? Oh, absolutely. SOL is actually the final piece in what Google is calling its unique investment in transatlantic resiliency. Okay. It works together with another key cable system called Nuvem. Ah, Nuvem. Yeah. So the two systems, they interconnect on land terrestrially in the US and over in Iberia, you know, Spain and Portugal and also in Bermuda and the Azores. This pairing, this interconnection, it creates really strong network robustness. How so? Well, SOL itself has 16 fiber optic pairs. Think of that as like 16 lanes on that data superhighway. 16 pairs, that's a lot. It is. It's a huge leap in capacity carrying just mind boggling amounts of data all at once. Enough for, you know, AI demands, high def streaming, everything. It's all about building a network that's strong, fault tolerant, and just incredibly high capacity. You know, one thing that really stood out to me from the announcement materials was that SOL, when it's finished, will be the only working fiber optic cable going straight from Florida to Europe. That's right. That seems huge. Why Florida specifically? And what does that unique direct link mean strategically? Doesn't most traffic go further north? That's a really sharp point. Florida's location is definitely strategic here. Most transatlantic cables, they do land much further north, New York, maybe Canada. Right. So having a direct link from Florida to Europe, it creates a totally new geographically separate route. That's vital for redundancy. Ah, so if something happens to the northern routes. Exactly. You're less reliant on those existing paths. Yeah. And it provides, you know, potentially better routes for certain data traffic. It also really positions Florida as this critical new gateway for international data, potentially bypassing congestion points further north. It's about making entirely new pathways, not just adding more lanes to the old roads. Let's zoom in a bit. Where does this massive cable actually, you know, touch down? Where does it meet the land in specific places? Let's start with the US side. Okay, so the US landing point is Palm Coast, Florida. Google's working with a company called DCBLOX there. To DCBLOX. Yeah, they specialize in data centers and connectivity. So they're not just landing the cable. They're setting up a whole new connectivity hub right there in Palm Coast. And beyond that, they're building out a land route, a terrestrial route, linking Palm Coast up to Google's cloud region in South Carolina. Got it. And the local leaders, they're clearly thrilled. You had Florida's Secretary of Commerce, J. Alex Kelly, calling a testament to the state's commitment to tech investment. And Palm Coast's Vice Mayor, Teresa Carli Pontieri, she said it's more than just infrastructure. It's a gateway to global connectivity, attracting new industries. Sounds like a big local impact. Definitely. And Chris Gatch from DCBLOX put it nicely. He said it enhances Florida's position as a nexus for global communications. Okay, let's hop across the Atlantic then. Where does Saul surface in Europe? What's happening in Spain? So in Spain, Google is teaming up with Telxis, their big global telecom infrastructure company. And they're landing the Saul cable in Santander up on the north coast. This move really helps integrate the Google Cloud region down in Madrid even further into the global network. And the reaction there, similar enthusiasm. Very similar. Santander's mayor, Gemma Igual, talked about how vital digital connectivity is now for economic and social progress, how it attracts investment, talent, tech companies. Makes sense. And Telxis' CEO, Mario Martin, he said they're delighted to support Google, calling it a key milestone that will boost transatlantic connectivity, boosting capacity, reliability, and resilience. That word again, resilience. Yeah, resilience seems key. Now, besides the U.S. and Spain, Saul also connects to Bermuda and the Azores. They're much smaller islands. Why are they so important in this huge Atlantic network? They are incredibly significant. Think of them as crucial stepping stones or maybe strategic junctions right in the middle of the Atlantic. Okay. Or Lima, who's the vice president of the government of the Azores, he welcomed the investment, said it fits perfectly with their vision of the Azores as a really important strategic hub for digital links between Europe and North America. Right, a mid-Atlantic hub. Exactly. And similarly, over in Bermuda, Alexa Lightbourne, the minister of home affairs, she said this further establishes Bermuda as a digital hub in the Atlantic. She highlighted how it fits their strategy to make Bermuda a leading place for tech companies and even from mainland Portugal. The minister of infrastructure and housing, Miguel Pinto Luz, he stressed that expanding this kind of subsea infrastructure is essential for the government. He noted Saul will increase resilience and meet that growing demand for digital infrastructure in Portugal and Europe generally. So these islands, they're not just dots on the map, they're really vital crossroads for all this global data flying around. Okay, this all sounds technically very impressive, a huge engineering feat, but let's cut to the chase a bit. How will Saul actually impact, say, my daily Netflix watching or maybe a small business relying on cloud services? Can we really feel the difference? That's the critical question, right, for the end user. The promise is that Saul will add capacity, increase reliability, and decrease latency. Okay, latency, that's the delay, right? Exactly. Latency is that annoying little lag before something starts happening online. So cutting latency means for you personally. Those tiny frustrating pauses in video calls or online games should pretty much vanish. Oh, that sounds good. Yeah. And for businesses, it means real-time collaboration tools actually work in real time. It means processing huge global data sets for things like AI models or complex analytics happens much, much faster. So things just feel quicker, more responsive. Snappier is a good word. More immediate, definitely more reliable. Think of it like upgrading from a winding country lane under the sea to a massive multi-lane superhighway. That's kind of the scale of the improvement Saul brings. And connecting this back to Google's bigger picture strategy for its global infrastructure, how does Saul fit in there, especially thinking about the massive demands of AI that everyone's talking about? Likely. So working alongside Google's other big cable projects, you mentioned Nuvem, there's also Fermina, Equiano, Grace Hopper. It really helps cement these key locations across the Atlantic as essential connectivity hubs. Right. Strengthening that digital backbone, it directly helps local economies, attracts investment, creates high-tech jobs like we heard from the local leaders. But there's a wider, absolutely critical purpose too. It's about making sure the network is robust enough, fast enough, and has low enough latency to handle the next generation of services, especially things like generative AI. So AI needs these kinds of superhighways. Absolutely. The benefits of AI, they can only really reach people and businesses everywhere if the underlying network, the pipes, can handle the colossal data flows these technologies create. Saul is really a foundational piece for that future. So recapping then, the Saul cable, it's a huge step forward for our global digital infrastructure. It's boosting connectivity, strengthening resilience, increasing speed across the Atlantic. It's a major upgrade.
