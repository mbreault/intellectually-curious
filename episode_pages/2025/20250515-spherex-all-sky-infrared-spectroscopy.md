## Transcript

Welcome back to the science corner. This is where we really get into the details for you, our intellectually curious listeners. Glad to be here. Today we're diving deep into SPHEREx. That's NASA's new near-infrared space observatory. A really fascinating mission. Launched just this March. March 11th, 2025. Right, on a Falcon 9. Yes, exactly. And it's set for a 25-month mission to survey the entire sky. The entire sky. And its main job, measuring near-infrared spectra. That's the core of it. For about 450 million galaxies. It's a staggering number. Hundreds of millions. And the truly groundbreaking part, I think, is the detail 96 different color bands. Which is, you know, a huge leap compared to previous all-sky maps. Much, much more spectral information. It's like going from a few crayons to a massive paint set, right? For analyzing cosmic light. That's a great analogy, yes. It allows for much finer distinctions, revealing more about what these galaxies are made of, their history. And to help us understand all this, we have a Nobel laureate with us today. Bringing incredible insight into the universe and missions like this one. So, maybe let's start with the basics. SPHEREx. What does the name actually stand for? Ah, yes, the acronym. It's quite descriptive. Spectrophotometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ice's Explorer. Wow, okay. So the name itself tells you it has broad ambitions. It certainly does. And it's worth remembering, NASA picked SPHEREx as a Medium Class Explorers mission. That was back in February 2019. Meaning it beat out other concepts? That's right. It went up against Arcus and Finesse, I believe. So the scientific community saw real promise here. The principal investigator, James Bach at Caltech, has been driving this. Okay, so years of work leading up to this. How does it actually do this mapping? What's the tech inside? Well, the core instrument is surprisingly simple in concept, yet very effective. It's a single instrument, no moving parts, one observing mode. Very streamlined. No moving parts. That's interesting for a space mission. Less to go wrong, I suppose. Precisely. It uses a spectrophotometer, which is essentially designed to measure near-infrared spectra. We're talking wavelengths from 0.75 up to 5.0 micrometers. And the key piece of tech is that filter you mentioned? Yes, the linear variable filter. Think of it as a strip where the color of light it lets through changes smoothly from one end to the other. Okay. And this isn't brand new tech, actually. It flew on the New Horizons mission to Pluto on the LISA instrument. So it's space proven. Right, LISA. I remember that. So how does this filter help get the full spectrum of different colors for each galaxy? It's clever. The filter sits over the detectors. So at any one spot of the detector, only a very narrow range of wavelengths gets through. Okay. To get the whole spectrum for, say, a galaxy, SPHEREx takes multiple pictures. Between each picture, it just slightly nudges its aim. Ah, so the galaxy's light lands on a different part of the detector. Exactly. And because the filter changes wavelength response across its surface, each snapshot captures a different sliver of the spectrum. I see. You combine all those snapshots, and you build up the full near-infrared spectrum for that object, piece by piece. That's really elegant. And the telescope itself, what's collecting the light? The telescope has a 20-centimeter aperture. Now, that might not sound huge compared to, say, Hubble or ground telescopes. But it's for an all-sky survey. Precisely. It's optimized for that. It has a wide field of view, too, 3.5 degrees by 11 degrees. So it gulps down large patches of sky at once. Makes sense. And the detectors? It uses six arrays. They're 2K by 2K pixels each, made of mercury cadmium telluride, HGCDTT. Which is good for infrared. Extremely sensitive in the near-infrared, yes. And each of those arrays has one of these linear variable filters layered on top. That's how they get the spectral info. Sounds like a beautifully integrated system. So with all this capability, what are the big science questions SPHEREx is trying to answer? Oh, the goals are fantastic. Number one is classifying those 450 million galaxies by their redshift. Redshift being how fast they're moving away from us, telling us distance. Essentially, yes. By matching the spectra SPHEREx measures to known galaxy templates, we can estimate their distances very accurately. This helps map the universe's expansion. Okay, what else? It's also looking for really faint light, the intra-halo light. That's the glow from stars scattered between galaxies and clusters. Tells us about galaxy mergers and interactions. Ah, interesting. Very faint signals. Very faint. And then there's the epoch of reionization. A huge area of study. That's when the first stars and galaxies lit up and ionized the universe, right? Exactly. A fundamental shift in cosmic history. SPHEREx will probe signals from that era. That's already a lot. But you mentioned the name covers even more. It does. SPHEREx's data will help us explore what drove inflation, that incredibly fast expansion right after the Big Bang. How does looking at galaxies tell us about inflation? By mapping the large-scale structure, the way galaxies cluster together, there might be subtle patterns imprinted on that structure from the inflationary period. I see, like cosmic fossils? In a way, yes. It also helps trace the origin and evolution of galaxies over billions of years. And perhaps a bit unexpectedly, it looks at the origin of water. Water? How? By searching for the spectral fingerprint of water ice. In molecular clouds where stars are born, in disks around young stars where planets form. It's looking for ice signatures across the cosmos. That's incredible. One mission tackling inflation, galaxy evolution, and the origins of water. How does this fit with other big space telescopes, like Euclid or the Roman Space Telescope? It's actually highly complementary. SPHEREx, Euclid, and Roman are all doing spectroscopy, but SPHEREx has this unique all-sky near-infrared angle. So they work together. How? Well, think about Euclid and Roman. They'll do deep spectroscopic surveys, often looking at very distant galaxies. SPHEREx provides crucial information about the galaxies in between us and those distant targets. The foreground galaxies. Exactly. Especially their precise redshifts, their distances. This is vital for studies using gravitational lensing. Ah, where the foreground galaxy's gravity bends the light from a background one. Precisely. To really understand that bending and map the dark matter causing it, you need to know the distance to the foreground lens galaxy very accurately. And SPHEREx provides that distance measurement across the whole sky. That's the synergy. SPHEREx gives Euclid and Roman the highly accurate foreground information they need to interpret their lensing data much more effectively. It helps them directly measure dark matter distribution. Like giving them a better calibration tool. A much better calibration, yes. And the point about inflation. SPHEREx's survey being at relatively lower redshifts, closer to us. It offers a mostly independent check on the parameters that describe inflation compared to what we learn from the cosmic microwave background. So a completely different line of evidence. Largely, yes. Which is incredibly valuable. It either strengthens our confidence in the standard model or might point towards new physics if there are discrepancies. Fascinating. Building such a complex mission, who were the main players involved? The spacecraft bus and the telescope structure came from BAE Systems, Inc. Many people might remember them as Ball Aerospace. Ah, right. Ball Aerospace. And the science payload, the spectrophotometer, the detectors, the real heart of it, that was developed jointly by Caltech and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, JPL. A California collaboration there. Yes. And we should also mention the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, KBI. They contributed a crucial piece of ground equipment, a non-flight cryogenic test chamber. Very important for testing the instrument before launch. So a bit of international contribution too. Can we briefly touch on the timeline and the costs? Big missions like this aren't cheap. No, certainly not. The idea was first proposed way back in December 2014. Then it went through NASA's selection hoops, phase A study in 2015, became a MADx finalist in 2017. And finally got the green light in 2019. February 2019, yes. The mission cost cap for this class, Medium Explorer, or MADx, was $250 million, but that's without the launch cost. Okay, so what was the total estimated cost? As of April 2020, the preliminary estimate, including launch and NASA reserves, was somewhere between, say, $395 million and $427 million. Still significant. Absolutely. It passed its major design review, phase C, in January 2021. Then SpaceX got the launch contract in Feb 2021 for the Falcon 9. And that launch cost? That was reported as $98.8 million. And it wasn't alone on that rocket. It shared the ride with the PONCH mission microsatellites. Right, sure. Okay, and launch was March 11th, 2025, as we said. Correct. First light, seeing space for the first time, was achieved in April 2025. And regular science operations kicked off just recently, May 1st, 2025. So it's
