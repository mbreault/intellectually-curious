## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive, where today we'll be exploring the fascinating world of glass sponges. Ooh, fascinating. Yeah, these aren't the sponges you do the dishes with, right? We're going deep into the ocean depths of these. No, not at all. These creatures are basically living ornaments with skeletons made entirely of glass. You got it. And what's even more incredible is their strange biology and potentially ancient history. Absolutely. So today, we'll be taking a deep dive into glass sponges for all you intellectually curious amateur scientists out there. Excellent. We're going to uncover what research has revealed about these fascinating creatures, from their unique glass skeletons to their bizarre cellular makeup. Sounds good. So let's get started. What are glass sponges exactly? Well, scientifically, they're known as hexactinellida. Hexactinellida. Yeah, and they're a class of sponges defined by these amazing skeletons made of silica. Silica. Yeah, think glass. Okay. These skeletons are built from these tiny interconnected structures called spicules, which are usually six-rayed, hence the name hexactinellida, hexa meaning six. Makes sense. And sometimes they can be four-rayed, but the six-rayed ones are the most common. So it's like a microscopic scaffolding made of glass. Exactly. Very cool. Now, I understand there's a bit of debate about where they fit into the whole classification of sponges. There is. There is. Right. Are they with the rest or are they special? Yeah, usually they're classified within the phylum Porifera, along with other sponges, you know. Classic sponges, yeah. But some scientists, because of their unique characteristics, especially their unusual cellular structure. We'll get to that. Yeah, we'll get to that. They've proposed putting them in their own phylum called Simplasma. Simplasma. Simplasma, yeah. Okay, interesting. So if we were on a deep sea dive and encountered a glass sponge, what would we actually see? What do they look like? Well, they often have this elegant cup-like shape. Cup-like. Yeah, kind of like a vase. Like a vase? Usually they range in size from about 10 to 30 centimeters in height. 10 to 30 centimeters. Yeah. But some can be much larger, of course. So it's not like a tiny little thing. No, no, not at all. And the glass skeletons give them this really sturdy lattice-like appearance. So even though it's glass, it's actually quite strong. It is surprisingly strong. A good example of this is the Bolosoma stalked glass sponge. Bolosoma? It looks really beautiful, like a delicate but strong glass vase. Okay. And color-wise, are we talking vibrant colors here? Not really. They tend to be on the paler side. Paler. Whites, pale yellows, light oranges, you know. So blending in with the environment a little bit. Yeah, I suppose you could say that. All right, so we've got these glass skeletons made from these spicules. How do they actually form this glass? It's like they're pulling glass out of the seawater. Well, in a way, that's exactly what they're doing. They extract silicic acid from the seawater. Silicic acid. Yeah, which is a dissolved form of silica, and then they use that to build their spicules. Okay, so is there like a special trick they use? How do they do that? Well, some species, particularly those in the Euplectella genus. Euplectella. Yeah, also known as the Venus's flower baskets. Oh, I've heard of those. They're quite beautiful. They are stunning. They use a special protein called glassin. Glassin, okay. And this glassin acts like a catalyst. A catalyst. Yeah, speeding up the conversion of that silicic acid into the silica structures of their spicules. So it's like their secret ingredient for making glass. Exactly. It's really fascinating how they've evolved this process. Yeah, very cool. So it's not just about accumulating minerals. They actually have an active biological process going on. Absolutely, it's very active. Okay, so they're building these intricate structures. And in terms of their overall body plan, is it similar to a typical sponge? Yeah, they have that fundamental sponge body plan, you know, relatively symmetrical structure. Symmetrical. Yeah, and they have a large central cavity. Central cavity, okay. But in glass sponges, this cavity often opens to the environment through a sieve-like structure formed by those fused spicules. So like a big open chamber in the middle. Yes, precisely. Now, let's talk about where they live. Where do we find these glass sponges in the vastness of the ocean? They're mostly deep sea dwellers, you know. They prefer depths between 450 and 900 meters below the surface. Wow, that's deep. It is, yeah. It's well into the twilight zone where sunlight barely reaches. So are they like completely in the dark then? Pretty much, yeah. But there are always exceptions, right? Oh, of course. Nature loves to break its own rules. Yeah, we have Ubsukes minuta, for example. Ubsukes minuta. Yeah, it's a glass sponge that actually lives in shallower waters. So it likes the sunshine a bit more? Well, a bit more, relatively speaking. And then there are others that have been found even deeper. Deeper than 900 meters? Yeah, down in the abyssal plains. That's incredible. So are they found all over the world then? They are. They've been found in all the world's oceans. They have a global distribution. Global distribution, okay. But interestingly, they seem to particularly thrive in the colder waters of the Antarctic and the northern Pacific. So they like it chilly. They do, they do. All right, so we've got these deep-dwelling glass-structured creatures. Now let's get into what really sets them apart. Their biology, particularly this thing called syncytia. What exactly is this? Oh, that's one of the most fascinating things about glass sponges. Yeah. It's really a key reason why some scientists want to put them in their own phylum. So it's a big deal. It is, it is. You see, unlike most multicellular organisms, including other sponges. Including other sponges. Yeah, much of a glass sponge's body is composed of this syncytial tissue. Syncytial tissue. Imagine this single enormous cell with countless nuclei. A single cell. A single cell, yes. Wow. Where the cytoplasm isn't divided by individual cell membranes. That's like one giant interconnected cell. Exactly. And this vast network is all supported by that framework of glass spicules. That's incredible. So it's like a single, continuous, living entity at a scale we don't often see. That's a great way to put it. So how does this affect how they function? Does it change things? Oh, absolutely. It has all sorts of implications. Like what? Well, even the cells that aren't part of this main syncytium, they still maintain connections. Connections. Yeah, they link to the syncytial body through these cytoplasmic rivers. Cytoplasmic rivers, what are those? Think of them like internal highways. Highways. Yeah, that transport nuclei, organelles, you know, all the cells' internal machinery and other essential molecules throughout the entire organism. So everything's connected. Everything's connected. It's a remarkably integrated system. So it's a radical departure from our traditional understanding of cells. You could say that. So how does this unique structure affect something as basic as how they eat? Their feeding mechanism is also very distinctive. Okay, how so? Well, they don't have the typical choanocytes that most sponges use. Choanocytes. Yeah, those flagellated collar cells that create the water currents. Right, right. Instead, glass sponges have these things called choanosyncytia. Choanosyncytia. Yeah, it's a mouthful, I know. These are further syncytial regions organized into these bell-shaped chambers. Bell-shaped chambers, okay. And lining these chambers are these collar bodies. Collar bodies, okay. Which are basically like choanocytes with a collar and a flagellum. Right. But they're not individual cells. They're part of that multinucleated tissue. So they're all working together. Exactly. And the beating of these flagellas all across this tissue draws water through the sponge's body, allowing them to filter out food. Like a coordinated feeding effort on a massive scale. Exactly. Very cool. Now, can they do other sponge-like things? Like can they contract their bodies? Actually, unlike a lot of other sponges, glass sponges can't contract. They can't contract. Nope. This is probably because of their rigid skeleton, you know, the glass. Right, that makes sense. And their syncytial organization, which isn't really built for muscular contraction. So they're more like stationary filter feeders. Pretty much, yeah. And I read that they can actually sense and respond to their environment really quickly, almost like a nervous system, which is not something you'd expect from a sponge. You're right. That's another amazing adaptation. What's going on there? They have this unique system for conducting electrical impulses across their syncytial body. Electrical impulses, wow. Yeah, and this allows them to respond quickly to things happening around them. So they're more aware than we might think. Much more aware. Do you have an example? Yeah, there's this species called Rhabdocalyptus dossone. Rhabdocalyptus dossone. When it detects sediment in the water, you know, stuff that could clog its filtering system, it stops feeding immediately. Wow, so it's like a built-in defense
