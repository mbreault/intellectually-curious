Learn about OEIS A000210

## Transcript

Welcome to this deep dive into a fascinating corner of the mathematical landscape, specifically, well, the online encyclopedia of integer sequences. Great to be digging into this. Today we're unpacking OEIS sequence A00210. Ah, yes, A00210. A really elegant sequence, and it's a fantastic example, I think, of how a definition that seems quite simple can actually lead to some really intricate mathematical connections. Absolutely. So for number theory students maybe just getting started with the OEIS, this sequence, A00210, it offers a pretty clear entry point into some quite profound ideas. Right. So this sequence, A00210, just to lay it out, it's generated by taking the floor of n multiplied by e1. And e, of course, is Euler's number, about 2.71828. So e1 is roughly 1.71828. That's the one. So you plug in n1, n2, n3, and so on, and you get the sequence 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, and it keeps going. For students exploring the OEIS, as you said, this isn't just a list of numbers. It's kind of a doorway, isn't it, into BD sequences. What's so special about generating numbers this way? Well, what's really fascinating is that this very straightforward rule, just taking the floor, the integer part, of multiples of an irrational number that's greater than 1, Gabe, it consistently produces sequences that have this surprising structure. These are what we call BD sequences. They're named after Samuel BD, who wrote about them formally back in 1926, I believe. Though actually Lord Rayleigh had touched on them even earlier. Ah, right. Rayleigh. Yes. And for this specific sequence, A00210, the irrational number driving it is e1. You know, you might think of multiplying by a constant and just chopping off the decimal part is, well, almost trivial. Yeah, sounds simple. But it gives rise to these unexpectedly deep relationships with other parts of mathematics. And one of the most striking of those has to be this idea of complementary BD sequences and Rayleigh's theorem. Okay, let's unpack that a bit. What does it mean for two BD sequences to be complementary? Right, so complementary BD sequences. They come about when you have two irrational numbers, let's call them R and S, both greater than 1. And they have to satisfy this very specific condition. The sum of their reciprocals is exactly 1. So 1 over R plus 1 over S equals 1. Got it. Exactly. Now, Rayleigh's theorem, which is just a beautiful, elegant result, states that the two BD sequences generated by such a pair, so floor and R and floor and S, they perfectly partition the set of positive integers. So every single positive integer, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, appears in exactly one of those two sequences. There are no overlaps, and no integer gets missed. Wow. Okay, that's pretty powerful, like puzzle pieces. Precisely. It has significant implications in areas like discrepancy theory, the study of how uniformly sequences are distributed. So for our sequence, A000210, where R is E1, what would the S be for the complementary sequence? Well, using that relationship, 1 divided by E1 plus 1 over S equals 1. If you just do the algebra. Rearrange it. Yeah, you solve for S, and you find that S equals E1 divided by E. So the BD sequence generated using that number, floor, would contain precisely all the positive integers that are not in A0000. They fit together perfectly. That's really neat. Now, the OEIS entry itself, it has this intriguing comment. It mentions A000210 shares its first 38 terms with another sequence, A082977. Ah, yes. And A082977 is defined differently. Its numbers congruent to certain values, 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10 modulo 12. That seems like more than a coincidence. It certainly suggests something, doesn't it? While Rayleigh's theorem gives us this global picture, this partitioning of all integers, these kinds of local coincidences, like matching terms or aligning with modular patterns, hint that the individual BD sequences themselves can possess their own interesting structure. So it hints that maybe some deeper pattern related to modulo 12. It could. It's possible this early agreement might relate to something like the continued fraction expansion of E1. Maybe how its convergence behaves. But yeah, that's speculation. It would need more digging. It's just a lovely reminder that these sequences, born from a simple operation, can intersect with number theory in surprising ways, like modular arithmetic. And speaking of connections, the Wikipedia entry on BD sequences mentions something called Sturmian sequences. What's the link there? Ah, Sturmian sequences. Yeah. Right. So if you take a BD sequence, like our A0000, and you look at the differences between consecutive terms. So A2, A1, A3, A2, and so on. Exactly. That sequence of differences actually forms what's called a characteristic Sturmian word or sequence. Think of it as an infinite binary string, just zeros and ones, or in this case, maybe two integer values, depending on the irrational number. That has the lowest possible complexity. It has a minimal number of distinct factors or subpatterns for its length. It's a bridge between number theory, the BD sequence itself, and combinatorics on words, the study of patterns in strings. Wow. Okay. From floor functions to complex patterns in sequences, it really branches out. It does. The Wikipedia page also notes some generalizations of Rayleigh's theorem. Yes. The basic idea of partitioning integers isn't strictly limited to just pairs of irrationals greater than one. You can extend it, for example, to positive real numbers, maybe not irrational, or include negative integers. How does that work? The formulations might change slightly, perhaps involving ceiling functions, rounding up instead of down, but there's a fundamental limit established by Espensky's theorem. Espensky? Yes. It states you cannot find three or more BD sequences that partition the positive integers perfectly, with each integer appearing exactly once. So Rayleigh's theorem for pairs is quite special. I see. So two's company, three's a crowd in terms of partitioning integers this way. You could say that, yeah. It highlights the uniqueness of the pairwise case. Okay, let's circle back to the OEIS entry for A00210 itself. It classifies it as non, meaning non-negative integers, which makes sense. Standard classification, yes. And it gives these handy formulas for Maple and Mathematica, floor and hsp1 to 1, and floor and e1. Really practical for anyone wanting to play with the sequence. Absolutely crucial. The OEIS aims to be a working tool, not just a list. And those computational formulas are key. And then there are the cross-references. A32097, A08342, that A082977 we mentioned, and a bunch of others nearby. Those cross-references are gold. They act like hyperlinks within the mathematical universe, suggesting sequences that might be related, complementary, generalizations, or share some property. Following those links can lead you down some very interesting paths. Like a mathematical breadcrumb trail. Exactly. It encourages exploration. And for the really keen, there's even a link to a research paper, Some Properties of BD Sequences 2 by I.G. Connell in the Canadian Mathematical Bulletin. Right, which just underscores that this isn't just, you know, recreational math. A sequence like A00210, simple as its definition looks, is a subject of genuine mathematical research. So wrapping this up, A00210, the sequence floor, it really is a beautiful example. It shows how irrational numbers like E1 can generate these integer sequences with really surprising deep properties. Couldn't agree more. We've seen its connection to its complementary sequence via Rayleigh's theorem, this link to Sturmian sequences, and how the OEIS entry itself is packed with information, formulas, cross-references, further reading. It's a great case study for number theory students. It really is. The OEIS entry serves as this concise yet really potent introduction to the whole world of BD sequences and how they fit into the bigger mathematical picture. So a final thought perhaps for you, the listener, to ponder. How does the fundamental nature of E itself, you know, the fact that it's transcendental, not the root of any simple polynomial equation, its role in calculus, how does that fingerprint show up in the way the numbers in A00210 are distributed? Hmm, that's a deep question. What subtle clues about E are hidden in this sequence and how it relates to others in the OEIS? What connections are still waiting to be uncovered? Something to think about. Thanks for joining us on this deep dive.
