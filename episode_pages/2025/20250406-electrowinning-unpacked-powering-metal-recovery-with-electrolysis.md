## Transcript

Welcome back to the Science Corner. For all you intellectually curious folks out there, today we're going to take a deep dive into something pretty fascinating, electrowinning. More specifically, we're looking at how it's used to extract and refine metals using electrolysis. A very intriguing area indeed. Yeah, and you know it's particularly relevant now with all the talk about resource recovery and just making industrial processes more efficient. We got some really interesting articles from you guys and we're eager to dig into them and see what we can learn. Absolutely. So we've got this piece here from the JOM Journal of the Minerals, Metals, and Materials Society. It seems to be making a case for the future of copper electrowinning, which is pretty interesting. Yes, a lot of potential there. Then we've got this in-depth look at improving the efficiency of copper electrowinning. This one's from the Journal of the Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. It looks pretty detailed. Oh, it is. It gets into the nitty-gritty. And for a more basic understanding, we've got this comparison of electrolysis and electrowinning. It's from Process Mechanic Gold Refining. Seems like a good place to start. I agree. It lays a good foundation. Right. And to kind of broaden things out, we'll touch on some related electrochemical stuff from a paper titled Electrolyte Spraying Within H2 Bubbles During Water Electrolysis. And we also have some cool examples of how electrowinning is being used from science.gov. Should give us a good overview. Sounds like a comprehensive set of resources. Yeah, definitely. So as we go through all this, what we really want to get is a solid grasp of, well, the basic principles of electrowinning. You know, how it actually works. Right. We also want to see how it's used, especially in recovering and refining metals to a high purity. And then, of course, we want to understand what factors affect its efficiency. Crucial aspects. Definitely. But, you know, we want to keep things clear and understandable. We don't want to get too bogged down in the technical details. So first things first, maybe we should just define electrowinning. Like, what exactly is it? Well, based on the information from Porsches Machina, electrowinning, at its core, is a process used to obtain high purity metals from solutions that are rich in those metals. Okay, so we're talking about solutions, like liquids. Exactly. And these solutions are typically created through a process called leaching. Essentially, the target metal is dissolved from a raw material, like an ore. So we're kind of pulling out the metal we want from, like, a mixture. Precisely. Then, during electrowinning, you pass an electric current through this metal-rich solution. Okay, so that's where the electro part comes in. Exactly. This electric current drives a chemical reaction that causes the metal ions in the solution, which have a positive charge, to move towards a negatively charged electrode. This electrode is called the cathode. Got it. So we're using electricity to move the metal around. In a way, yes. As these metal ions reach the cathode, they gain electrons. This process is known as reduction. And as a result, they deposit onto the cathode's surface as pure metal. So it's like we're pulling the metal out of the solution and plating it onto this cathode thing. That's a good analogy. Now, Process Machina also makes this distinction between electrowinning and electrolysis. What's the difference? Well, both electrowinning and electrolysis use electrical currents to drive chemical reactions that wouldn't happen spontaneously. Okay. However, electrolysis is a broader term. It refers to any process where electricity is used to break down a compound or make a chemical change happen. Electrowinning, on the other hand, is more specific. It's focused solely on extracting metals from a solution that contains their ions. So electrowinning is like a subset of electrolysis. That's a good way to put it. And is there a difference in how they're actually set up, like the equipment and stuff? Yes, there are some key differences, especially when it comes to the electrodes. In electrowinning, the anode, which is the positively charged electrode, is usually inert. Inert. So it doesn't really react or anything? Exactly. Its job is basically to conduct electricity and help facilitate the counter-reaction, which in solutions with water often involves oxidizing the water to produce oxygen gas and hydrogen ions. The metal ions, as we discussed, are reduced and deposited as pure metal at the cathode. But in some electrolytic processes, particularly those used in metal refining, you might actually use an impure sample of the metal as the anode. Huh, interesting. As the current flows, this impure metal anode dissolves into the electrolyte, and then the pure metal is selectively deposited at the cathode. This leaves the impurities behind in the solution or as a sludge at the bottom. So with electrowinning, we're starting with metal ions that are already in a solution, but with some types of electrolysis, we're actually creating those ions from a solid anode. Precisely, that's a key distinction. Okay, that makes sense. Now, can you use either technique for any metal, or are there limitations? Well, electrolysis, being broader, can be applied to a wide range of elements and compounds. It's used to produce aluminum from its oxide, chlorine and sodium hydroxide from brine, even refining precious metals like gold and silver. Wow, so it's pretty versatile. It is. Electrowinning, though it can be used for gold and silver too, is more commonly associated with base metals like copper, nickel, and zinc. These are typically recovered from leach solutions derived from ores. As Process Machina highlights, it's a cornerstone of hydrometallurgy, which is all about extracting metals from aqueous solutions. Interesting. Now, everyone's talking about energy efficiency these days. How do the two processes compare in that regard? Generally, Process Machina suggests that electrowinning can be more energy efficient per kilogram of metal recovered compared to some electrolytic processes, especially those that involve breaking down very stable compounds. Makes sense. The reason for this is that the metal is already in ionic form in the solution. So you need less energy to get it ready for deposition. But of course, the actual energy consumption depends on many things. The metal concentration, the conductivity of the electrolyte, the current density used, etc. So electrowinning seems like a more focused and often more energy conscious way to extract pure metals from a solution. I would agree with that assessment. Now, to see how widely electrowinning is used, we can look at some examples from science.gov. It's pretty amazing. Yes, the applications are quite diverse. So for example, it's used a lot in producing high purity copper cathodes from copper oxide ores. Right, that's a major application. It's also being explored for recovering gold from thiosulfate leach solutions, particularly from recycled printed circuit boards, which is great for sustainability. Absolutely, it's a key technology for the circular economy. And in the nuclear industry, they're looking at using it to extract uranium and plutonium from molten salts. This could help with reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, which is pretty important. A very specialized but crucial application. And then there's the recovery of other valuable metals like lead and cobalt from industrial waste streams. So it's not just about copper. Not at all. It has a significant role in responsible resource management. Okay, so let's zoom in on copper electrowinning for a bit. The JOM article and the Southern African Institute study give us a deeper look at that. What are some of the key takeaways there? Well, the JOM article really focuses on the future of copper electrowinning. It emphasizes that it's still incredibly important and has a lot of room for innovation. Makes sense. Copper is still a vital metal. Absolutely. And the study from the Southern African Institute highlights a major challenge, the substantial electrical energy consumption of copper electrowinning. In plants that use heap leaching followed by electrowinning, they found that electrowinning can consume a huge chunk of the total energy, sometimes as much as 60 to 80%. Wow, that's a lot. So improving efficiency is really important. It's crucial, both for economic reasons and to reduce the environmental impact of copper production. Now, the study mentioned something called current efficiency. What exactly is that and why is it so important? Current efficiency essentially tells us how well the electrical current we're putting into the electrowinning cell is being used to deposit the copper we want at the cathode. It's basically a ratio, the amount of copper deposited compared to the maximum amount that could be deposited based on how much electricity we're using, as per Faraday's laws of electrolysis. So ideally, we want that ratio to be as close to 100% as possible. Exactly. That would mean all the electrical energy is going towards plating the copper. Even small deviations from 100% can have big economic and environmental consequences, especially when you consider the scale of copper production. Right, because if the current efficiency isn't perfect, some of that energy is being wasted. Right, precisely. And that wasted energy usually goes towards driving other unwanted electrochemical reactions. Like what? The most common one is the electrolysis of water itself. This produces hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode. It uses up electricity, but doesn't produce any copper. Makes sense. Plus, if there are impurities in the electrolyte, like iron or manganese ions, they can also react with the electrodes, further reducing the current available for copper plating. So impurities can also mess things up. They can, yes. Now, the Southern African Institute research pinpointed something they called metallurgical short circuits, or hot spots, as a major problem. What exactly are those?
