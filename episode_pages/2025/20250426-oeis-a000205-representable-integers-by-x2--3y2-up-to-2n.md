## Description

An exploration of A000205â€”the count of positive integers â‰¤ 2n that can be written as x^2 + 3y^2. We unpack the binary quadratic form x^2 + 3y^2, its discriminant -12, and why representability ties to modular criteria and prime-factor parity via Thueâ€“Vinogradov methods. In particular, n is representable by x^2 + 3y^2 iff the exponent of 2 in n or 2n is even and every prime p â‰¡ 2 (mod 3) occurs to an even power; a window into the wider theory of quadratic forms and class numbers.

## Transcript

Welcome to this deep dive into the online encyclopedia of integer sequences. Today we're looking at a sequence that should be interesting for you number theory students out there, a 000205. Ah, yes, that one counts the positive integers up to 2n that you can write in the form x squared plus 3 times y squared. Right. It used to have other names too, m2350 and 0928 apparently. Our mission today really is to unpack why the sequence is mathematically interesting. Like why count those specific numbers by 2 plus 3y2 and y up to powers of 2? Exactly. And it ties into that, well, fundamental question in number theory. Which integers can you represent with a certain quadratic form? It goes way back, doesn't it? Like Fermat looking at sums of two squares by 2 plus y2. That's the classic example that really got this whole area started. So the big question for you listening is, why focus on this form by 2 plus 3y2 in this specific way of counting? To start answering that, maybe we should lay out the basics first. What are binary quadratic forms? Good idea. So a binary quadratic form, it's basically an expression like ax2 plus byc plus cy2. Where a, b, and c are integers, right? That's right. They have to be integers. And the big question is, which numbers, which integers n, can you actually make using that form? You mean finding integer solutions r and s so that any of those r2 plus bz plus cs2? Precisely. Finding those r and s. We mentioned Fermat, by 2 plus y2. People also studied i2 plus 2y2 and of course our focus, by 2 plus 3y2. And the difficulty changes depending on the form. It does. It often relates to something called the discriminant d equals b2 4ac. The, let's say, complexity tends to increase as the absolute value of d gets bigger. Okay, so we have these forms representing integers. But I remember reading that sometimes different looking forms are kind of the same. Equivalents. Exactly, equivalents. Two forms are equivalent if you can transform one into the other using a, well, a specific kind of linear change of variable. Integer coefficients determinant 1, that sl2z thing. That's the one. You can think of it using 2x2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1. And the point is? The point is, equivalent forms represent the exact same set of integers. So studying one is like studying the whole family. That simplifies things. So, can we always pick a best representative from each family? Like a standard one? Yes. That's where the idea of reduced forms comes in. For forms where the discriminant isn't a square, there are conditions, inequalities involving a, b, and c. That define whether a form is reduced. Right. And the really important fact is, for a given discriminant, there's only a finite number of these reduced forms. Finite. Wow. Okay. Which lets us define the class number, hd. That's simply the number of different equivalence classes for that discriminant d. Are there examples with only one class? Where all forms are basically the same? Oh yes. Some important ones, like discriminant minus 3, minus 4, 9, 7, 8, 11, they all have class number 1. Interesting. So for those discriminants, there's essentially only one form to worry about, up to equivalence. Yeah. How does this connect back to figuring out if a specific number n can be represented? Okay, we need one more concept. Proper representation. This means n equals i o 2 plus bi plus co 2, but with the extra condition that i and go are co-prime. Their greatest common divisor is 1. Exactly. Now here's a crucial result. An integer n is properly represented by some form of discriminant d if and only if d is a square modulo 4n. d is a square modulo 4n. That sounds powerful. It is. Let's take Fermat's two squares again. The form is by 2 plus y2. Discriminant is minus 4. Okay. The proposition says n is represented by some form of discriminant minus 4 if and only if minus 4 is a square mod 4n. If n is an odd prime p, this boils down to asking if minus 1 is a square mod p. Which is true if and only if p is congruent to 1 mod 4. Exactly. Or key 2. So the theorem connects representation to modular arithmetic. Brilliant. Okay, let's bring it back to a 0 0 0 2 0 5. The form is by 2 plus 3y2. What's the discriminant there? Here a1, b0, c a3. So d is 0 2 4 1 3 plus 3y2. Right, that's exactly the kind of question this theory helps answer. And didn't the Stack Exchange discussion try to figure out which integers generally are of the form by 2 plus 3y2? Something about primes congruent to 1 mod 3. Yes. That discussion uses induction and properties of primes, especially those congruent to 1 mod 3, to build up a characterization for all integers representable in that form. So why does the sequence a 0 0 0 2 0 5 count them only up to 2n? That power of 2 limit seems specific. It is specific. It suggests maybe there's something interesting about how the representability by 2 plus 3y2 interacts with powers of 2 or maybe the binary structure. Mathematica code snippet just checks everything, right, up to 2n? Pretty much. For each n, it iterates through integers k from 2n-1, that's 1, up to 2n, checks if k is by 2 plus 3y2 for some non-negative xy, and adds the count to the previous term. It's direct, but could be slow. And the OEIS page itself links a 0 0 0 2 0 5 to other sequences. Like number of squares up to n. And a 0 0 0 3 1 3 6. Numbers of the form by 2 plus y2. This seems a 0 0 0 2 0 5 is part of a family counting numbers representable by different quadratic forms. I wonder how they relate. Absolutely. And there's that mention of Maury and Terry L's work connecting by 2 plus 3y2 to hexagonal lattices, comparing them to square lattices for by 2 plus y2. It hints at a geometric angle too. Geometry. Algebra. Okay, now another source mentioned a different approach. Sue Vinogradov. How does that fit in? Right, the Sue Vinogradov method gives us another set of tools, specifically for forms like by 2 plus dy2. Like ours, by 2 plus 3y2. Exactly. Theorem 19 in that source is key for us. It says, if you take a positive integer n that's co-prime to 12, meaning gcd n 12 equals 1. Yes. Then minus 3 is a square modulo n if and only if n can be written as by 2 plus 3y2. Whoa, so for numbers not divisible by 2 or 3, representability is equivalent to numbers divisible by 2 or 3. Precisely. Corollary 20 lays out the complete condition. A positive integer n is of the form by 2 plus 3y2 if and only if two things hold. Okay, what are they? First, the power of 2 in the prime factorization of n written or 2n must be even. Or 2n even. Got it. Second, for every prime factor p of n that's congruent to many of 1 modulo 3, or you could say 2 mod 3, it's the same thing. Like 5, 11, 17. Yes. For all those primes p, the power of p in the factorization of n or dpn must also be even. So or dpn has to be even and or dpn has to be even for all primes p that are 2 mod 3. That's the condition. It gives you a complete checklist based purely on the prime factorization of n. So that's what determines which numbers get counted in a 0 0 0 2 0 5. Any integer k up to 2n is counted if and only if it satisfies those two conditions on the exponents of its prime factors. Exactly right. The sequence tracks how many integers up to 2n meet this specific criterion involving even exponents with a prime 2 and all primes congruent to 2 mod 3. Okay, let's try to wrap this up. We dove into a 0 0 0 2 0 5 which counts integers up to 2 of it of the form by 2 plus 3y2. And we saw this representation isn't random. It's governed by specific rules about the prime factors of the integer. Rules that come from the Thue-Vinogradov approach. Specifically Corollary 20. The exponent of 2 must be even. And exponents of primes congruent to 2 mod 3 must also be even. And all of this fits into the beautiful broader theory of binary quadratic forms involving discriminants like minus 12 for our form equivalence classes and class numbers. We saw how understanding when minus 3 is a square mod n was a key part of the puzzle. Definitely. So here's something to ponder as
