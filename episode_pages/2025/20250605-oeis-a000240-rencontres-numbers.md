## Transcript

Welcome to the deep dive. Today we're taking a plunge into, well, a corner of mathematics that might sound a bit obscure at first. Yeah, but stick with us because it really does reveal some surprisingly elegant truths about randomness and order. We're guided by quite a stack of sources here, everything from, you know, academic papers and online encyclopedias like Wolfram Mathworld and Wikipedia, even a curious post from Math Forum on Reddit. And our mission for this deep dive is really to unpack the world of Rincontris numbers. We're specifically focusing on this fascinating sequence. It's called A000240 in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, or OEIS. Okay, A000240. And what does that sequence count? It counts the number of ways you can rearrange a set of things so that exactly one item ends up back where it started, just one. Exactly one. So it's like figuring out how many ways things can go mostly wrong in a shuffle, but, you know, with one single thing staying put. Precisely. And here's a bit of a teaser right up front, something we pulled from the source material. We're going to uncover this kind of bizarre truth. It turns out that for large enough rearrangements, the chance of nothing ending up where it started is surprisingly the same as the chance of exactly one thing ending up where it started. It's pretty counterintuitive. We'll definitely dig into why that happens using insights from, like you said, MathWorld, OEIS, Wikipedia, also a presentation we saw from Missouri State, and that Reddit discussion. It sounds like a journey, starting with simple counting, but ending up somewhere quite fundamental, touching on constants and probability. Exactly. So let's set the stage first. Okay. When mathematicians talk about rearranging items, the term they use is permutation. Our sources define it pretty simply. It's a mapping of elements from a set back onto itself. Right. Basically, if you have a bunch of objects, a permutation is just one possible way to order them, shuffle them up. And within any permutation, a really key concept for us today is the fixed point. A fixed point. A fixed point is just an element in that rearranged set that hasn't moved. It's still sitting in its original spot. Okay. Like shuffling a deck of cards, maybe. Okay. The original order is your starting set. Good analogy. Any order after you shuffle is a permutation. If, say, the ace of spades started on top, and after your shuffle, it's still on top. Then that ace of spades is a fixed point. Right. For that specific shuffle, most cards move, but the fixed points, they stay put. Exactly. And the classic problem that often leads into this whole area, which our sources mention, is the idea of a derangement. Derangement. Okay. A derangement is a permutation where there are no fixed points at all. Zero. Every single thing has moved from its original position. Everything's out of place. Right. The sources note that the number of derangements of n objects is often written as dn zero, or sometimes, and this is kind of memorable, using subfactorial notation, which looks like n. N. Yeah. And Wolfram MathWorld actually tells us that term subfactorial came from someone named Whitworth. And Euler himself was calculating the first few values way back. Okay. And there's a common example for derangements. It's in the Missouri State material. A teacher handing back exams to six students. Ah, the dreaded exam return. Exactly. If the teacher just shuffles the tests randomly and hands them back, how many ways can they do it so that none of the students get their own test? Okay, so nobody gets the right one. That's counting derangements of six things, d6 zero. Precisely. And that number, d6 zero, happens to be 265. 265 ways for six students to all get the wrong test back. But what's really interesting about derangements, and the sources highlight this, is the probability aspect. Right. The chance that a totally random permutation of n things is a derangement, well, as n gets bigger and bigger, that probability gets closer and closer to a specific number, 1e. 1 over e. Euler's number. Yeah, which is about 0.368 or roughly 37%. So there's about a 37% chance that if you randomly shuffle a whole lot of items, none of them will end up back where they started. Huh. About a third of the time, everything moves. Roughly, yeah. And this is where Ron Contra's numbers finally enter the picture, as the Wikipedia source explains. They basically generalize this idea. Okay, so going beyond just zero fixed points. Exactly. Ron Contra's numbers, written as dn k, count the permutations of n objects that have exactly k fixed points. So k could be zero, which is the derangement case we just talked about. Right. dn k. Or k could be one or two or, you know, any number up to n. The name Ron Contra's, it's French for encounter or meeting. Sometimes the problem is linked to a solitaire game. The sources also call them partial derangements. Partial derangements, that makes sense. Some things are fixed, the rest are deranged. Well, the non-fixed points aren't necessarily deranged among themselves, but overall, you have exactly k fixed points. For instance, Wikipedia gives an example. Seven presents for seven people. Okay. If you want to know how many ways exactly two people get the right present, you're calculating d7 2. And the answer is? The sources say d7 2 is 924. Or think of seven dance couples. d7 2 is also the number of ways exactly two of the original couples end up dancing together after a random mix-up. Again, 924. Okay, so that brings us to our main focus today. The case where k equals 1, dn 1. Right. This is the sequence A000240 in the OEIS, the number of permutations of n objects with exactly one fixed point. Let's look at the first few numbers in that sequence. A000240 from the OEIS database. What are they? Okay, starting from n1, it goes 1, 0, 3, 8, 45, 264, 1855, 12832, and so on. 1, 0, 3, 8. Okay, let's try to make sense of those small ones. For n1, just one object, let's call it 1. The only possible rearrangement or permutation is just 1. Does that have exactly one fixed point? Well, yeah. 1 is in the first position where it started, so yes. One fixed point. So there's one set's permutation. The first number in the sequence is 1. Okay, A1, 1. Check. Good. Now, n2, objects 1, 2. The permutations are 1, 2, and 2, 1. Okay. First one, 1, 2, fixed points. 1 is in position 1. 2 is in position 2. Both are fixed, so that's two fixed points. Not 1. Okay, what about 2, 1? 1 is in position 2. 2 is in position 1. Neither is in its original spot. That's zero fixed points. A derangement. Also not 1. So for n2, neither permutation has exactly one fixed point. The count is zero. And that matches the second term in the sequence, A2. Okay, this is working. Now for the interesting one, n3, objects 1, 2, 3. There are 3 factorials, which is 6 permutations. We need to check them all for exactly one fixed point. Let's list them out. 1, 2, 3. That have 3 fixed points, 1, 2, and 3. Nope, 1, 3. Okay, 1 is in position 1. Fixed 3 is in position 2. 2 is in position 3. So just one fixed point. 1, yes, that's 1. Good. Next, 2, 1, 3. 2 is in position 1. 1 is in position 2. 3 is in position 3. Fixed. So just one fixed point. 3, yes, that's 2. 2, 3, 1. 2 and 1, 3 and 2, 1 and 3. No fixed points. That's a derangement. Nope. 3, 1, 2. 3 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 3. Also no fixed points. Another derangement. Nope. Last one, 3, 2, 1. 3 and 1. 2 is in position 2. Fixed 1 is in position 3. So there's just one fixed point. 2, that's 3. So we found exactly 3 permutations for n equal 3 with exactly one fixed point. 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, and 3, 2, 1. And the third term in the sequence was 3. Perfect. A3, 3. Yeah. And the OEIS source actually adds a neat little note for this n to be 3 case. It points out that these 3 permutations are precisely the simple transpositions. Transpositions. You mean just swapping 2 elements? Exactly. Like in 1, 3, 2, you swap 2 and 3, leave 1 alone. In 2, 1, 3, you swap 1
