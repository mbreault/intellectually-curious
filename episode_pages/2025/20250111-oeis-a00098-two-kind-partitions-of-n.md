Weâ€™ll also look at the main formulas: the generating function, a recursive formula, and an asymptotic expression that reveals its growth, highlighting why this simple counting setup leads to rich structure.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our deep dive into the OEIS. The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. That's right. And for anyone just joining us... It's a vast collection of numerical patterns. Right. Vast. And it's fascinating how... It's really for anyone interested in math or patterns. Yeah, exactly. And today we're tackling... Computer science. And even physics. Exactly. And today we're diving into A00098. Okay, A00098. Number of partitions of N if there are two kinds of 1, two kinds of 2, and two kinds of 3. Right. So that title might sound a little bit intimidating at first. It does sound a bit cryptic. Yeah. But I think we can break it down. Yeah, please. So let's start with partitions. Okay, partitions. Imagine you have a bunch of apples. A partition is just all the different ways you can group those apples. So if I have three apples, I could have all three together or one and then two. Exactly. Okay. So you're dividing a number into smaller whole numbers that add up to the original. Okay, got it. Now, 00098 adds a little twist. We have two types of each number, 1, 2, and 3. So it's like having two red apples and two green apples? Yeah. Oh, and then two red pears and two green pears and so on. Yeah, so we're not just counting simple partitions. We have to consider these distinct types. So, for example, the sequence says that A3 is 10. Okay, A3 equals 10. Meaning there are 10 ways to partition the number 3. When we have these two types... When we have two types of each number from 1 to 3. 10 different ways. Yeah, that's more than you might initially think. Yeah, definitely. Could you maybe give us a visual? Sure. Let's say we have marbles. Okay. We have two red marbles labeled 1, two blue marbles also labeled 1, two red marbles labeled 2, two blue also labeled 2, and the same for 3. Okay, so we've got a bunch of marbles. Now we need to find all the ways to arrange these marbles to represent the number 3 taking into account the colors. Oh, okay. So, like, I could have three red 1 marbles or three blue ones or a mix. Exactly. And then we bring in the 2s and the 3s. I can see how it adds up fast. Yeah, even for a small number like 3, the possibilities expand rapidly. Okay, so that's what A00098 represents. Right. The first few terms are 1, 2, 5, 10, 19, 33. Right. And looking at those terms... Do you see any patterns? What's fascinating is this sequence also connects to partitions of odd numbers. Really? Specifically, it represents the number of ways to partition an odd number, like 2n plus 1, into exactly three odd parts. Hmm. So there's a relationship between these two types of partitions. Yes, and the only difference is the sequence for odd number partitions is offset by one position. Interesting. So two different ways of partitioning numbers lead to a closely related sequence. It really highlights how interconnected mathematical concepts can be. Yeah, that's one of the things that makes the OEIS so interesting. Absolutely. Okay, I'm also curious about the comments section in the OEIS entry. Right. It looked like there are even more ways to interpret this sequence. Yes, one comment suggests that A00098 can be viewed as a result of combining two other sequences, A00041 and A01399, through a process called convolution. Convolution. Yeah. I'm not familiar with that term. It's like you have two rows of numbers, and you slide one row across the other, multiplying the overlapping numbers and adding the products at each step. Okay, so you're creating a new row of numbers. Exactly. And that new row corresponds to A00098. So we're building A00098 from two simpler sequences. Right. It shows how complex sequences can be built from simpler building blocks. This is already getting fascinating. Yeah. We haven't even looked at the formulas yet. Right, the formula section in the OEIS entry gives us a bunch of different ways to understand and calculate the terms of A00098. Okay, so we've got the comments section, which gives us different interpretations, and then we've got the formula section. Exactly. Each one offers a different perspective. This deep dive is already so rich. Yeah, it is. So we dive into those formulas now or save that for later? I think it would be good to look at the formulas now. Okay, great. What's the first formula listed? The first one is the generating function for A00098, which is 1, 1x, 1 by 2, 1 by 3, product k1, 1xk. Okay, generating functions always seem to pop up in the OEIS. Yeah. Can you remind us what a generating function is? Sure. It's like a mathematical DNA for a sequence. Okay. It encodes the entire sequence into a single expression. So this particular generating function has all the information needed to generate the entire sequence of A00098. Yes, and you can actually manipulate it to get insights into the sequence's behavior. Wow, so much you can do with it. Are there other formulas listed? Yeah, we also have the recursive formula, AN, sum j0.floor N3, A00097, N-3j, N, A0. Okay, a recursive formula. This lets us calculate any term in the sequence using previous terms. So it's like a step-by-step method. Exactly. You build the sequence one term at a time. I see, there's one more, the asymptotic formula. Right, that one is AN, stuartian, xp, p-squared, 2n3, 2q, 2p2. What does that one tell us? It tells us how the sequence behaves as n gets really large. So like long-term trends? Exactly. It helps you see the big picture of how the sequence grows. Wow, we've covered so much already, and I feel like we're just getting started. Yeah. Before we go any further, could we just do a quick recap of what we've learned about A00098? Sure. We started by defining A00098 as the number of ways to partition a number when we have two types of each number, 1, 2, and 3. Okay. We looked at the initial terms, and then we saw a connection to partitions of odd numbers. Right. We also talked about convolution and how it relates to the sequence. Okay. And finally, we touched on the three formulas, the generating function, the recursive formula, and the asymptotic formula. Right. So many different ways to understand this sequence. Exactly. It's amazing how much complexity there is in the concept of partitions. It is fascinating, isn't it? Yeah. Should we keep going with the sequence? I think we should. Okay, great. Let's delve deeper. All right, so we were talking about that connection between A00098 and partitions of odd numbers. Can we unpack that a little more? Sure. Let's look at a partition of an odd number with three odd parts. Okay. So, for example, let's take the number 7. 7, okay. And the partition 1 plus 3 plus 3. Okay, so three odd numbers that add up to 7. Now imagine that within each of those odd parts, we have two types. Two types. One type represents the oddness of the part, and the other represents the evenness. The oddness and the evenness. Yeah. How does that work? So for the first part, 1, we have one odd 1 and zero even ones. Okay, one odd 1 and zero even ones. For the two 3 parts, we could have one odd 3 and one even 3. So we're using the two types to kind of mirror the structure of that odd partition. Right. It's like translating the partition into a new language. Okay, I think I'm following. If you apply this consistently, you can create a direct link between partitions of odd numbers with three odd parts and the partitions we're counting in A00098. So like a secret passage between two mathematical worlds? Yeah, and it shows that A00098 isn't just about counting partitions with two types of 1, 2, and 3. It's reflecting a deeper property about how odd numbers are put together. Okay, so it's encoding something fundamental about numbers. Exactly, and that's what makes exploring these sequences so rewarding. Yeah, it really shows you the power of looking at simple things like partitions. Absolutely, they can reveal really deep truths about numbers. Okay, so we've seen how A00098 connects to partitions of odd numbers. Right. Before we wrap up, is there anything else about this sequence that stands out to you? I think what's really cool is how it combines simplicity and complexity. Partitions seem simple at first, but then you add these extra layers like different types, and it gets really complex really fast. Like a mathematical fractal? Yeah, exactly. You start with a basic rule, and then it leads to these intricate patterns. A00098 is a perfect example of that. It is. You start with this basic counting rule, and it leads to connections to convolution binomial coefficients, partitions of odd numbers, and all those formulas. Exactly. It's a great reminder that even simple math ideas can be incredibly deep. Absolutely. It's all about exploring and looking at things from different angles. And the OEIS is a fantastic tool for doing that. Yeah, a whole world of mathematical patterns just waiting to be
