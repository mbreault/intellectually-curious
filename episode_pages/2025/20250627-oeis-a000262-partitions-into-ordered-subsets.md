Learn about OEIS A000262 Partitions into Ordered Subsets

## Transcript

Welcome back to the deep dive. Today we're jumping into another sequence from the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. This is part of our ongoing series for number theory students or really anyone who just loves exploring these mathematical patterns. Our target today, OEIS A000262. We're going to unpack this one and see where it leads. So the official description is the number of sets of lists. Okay, what does that mean? It's the number of partitions of one into any number of lists where a list means an ordered subset. That sounds a little dense maybe. Let's break it down. Like for N0 it's defined as 1. Simple enough. For N1 the set is just one. The only way to partition that is, well, just one list. So A1 is 1. But then it takes off. The first few terms are 1, 1, 3, 13, 73. See, it grows pretty quickly. And to help us make sense of all this, its connections, its hidden depths, we're really lucky to have a Fields Medal winning mathematician with us today. Welcome. Thanks. It's great to be here. A000262 is, well, it's a really neat example of how combinatorial ideas can interlink in surprising ways. That definition, sets of lists where each list is ordered, it's worth spending a moment on. Let's look at how we actually get those first few terms you mentioned. Please do. I think N2 where A23 is probably the first place it gets slightly non-obvious. Right. So for N2 we're partitioning the set 1, 2. Now lists means ordered subsets. So 12 is one list and it's different from 21. That's another list. Okay, so the order within the list matters. That gives us two possibilities already. Exactly. Those are the cases where we put everything into a single list. But we can also partition 1, 2 into multiple lists. The only way here is into two lists, 1 and 2. So precisely. And because the definition says sets of lists, the order of those lists themselves doesn't matter. 1, 2 is the same thing as 2. It's just one way. Got it. So the ordered list 12, the ordered list 21, and the set of lists. Yes. Okay, A23 makes sense now. Good. Now let's try N3. The set is 1, 2, 3, and A3 is 13. We just apply the same logic, but there are more combinations. I bet. How do we break that down? We can think about the structure of the partition. First, what if we put all three elements into a single ordered list, like 1, 2, 3? Okay, so you could have 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1. That's 3 factorial, right? 6 ways. Exactly. 3, 6 ways for single lists containing all elements. Now what if we partition 1, 2, 3 into two lists? It must be one list of size 2 and one list of size 1, like say 12 and 3. Right, so like 12, 3, or maybe 21, 3. You need to choose which two elements go into the ordered list, and there are three ways to choose the pair, say 1, 2. Then you need to order them two ways, 12 or 21. The remaining element, like 3, forms its own list, 3. Okay, so choosing 12 gives 12, 3, and 21, 3. Choosing 13 gives 13, 2, and 31, 2. Choosing 2, 3 gives 23, 1, and 32, 1. That's another six ways. That's it. Six ways for that type of partition. So we have six from the single list case, six from the list of 2 plus singleton case. What's left? Splitting it into three lists, like 1, 2, 3. Perfect. All singletons, 1, 2, 3. And since it's a set of lists, order doesn't matter. There's only one way to do that. So 6 plus 6 plus 1 is 13. It works out. It's quite methodical. It is. It requires careful bookkeeping. And you can imagine for N4, where A473 gets, well, significantly more involved. I can definitely see that. We probably don't need to walk through all 73, but what kind of arrangements are we talking about for N4, just the categories? Sure. For N4, you'd consider a single list of four, like 1234. There are 424 ways to order those. Then partitions into two lists. This could be a list of three and a singleton, like 123. Or it could be two lists of two, like 1234. You'd count the ways for each type. Right. Got to consider the ordering within each list and the choices of elements. Then partitions into three lists. That would have to be one list of two and two singletons, like 123. Okay. And finally, the partition into four lists, all singletons, 1, 2, 3, 4. Just one way for that. Wow. So summing up the counts for 1234, 1234, and 1234 must give 73. Precisely. The combinatorics gets richer with each step. It definitely does. Thanks. That clarifies the core definition a lot. But you mentioned earlier, and this is where I think it's really fascinating, that A000262 isn't just about counting these sets of lists. It shows up in other places. It absolutely does. And that's often the magic of these sequences in the OEIS. They act like mathematical fingerprints appearing in contexts that look totally different on the surface. Like, right. Give us an example. Okay, well, consider permutations. Thomas Weider found an incredible connection. He showed that An is exactly what you get if you do the following. Take every single permutation of the numbers 1 to n. There are n of them. For each permutation, figure out its cycle decomposition, you know, how it breaks down into cycles. Like 1, 2, 3, 4 is two cycles of length 2. Exactly. Then, for that single permutation, multiply the lengths of all its cycles together. So for 1, 2, 3, 4, you do 2, 2, or 4. Now do that calculation. Multiply the cycle lengths for every single one of the n permutations. And finally, add up all those products. Add them all up. Add them all up. The final sum you get is An. Whoa. So for n4, you'd look at all 24 permutations, calculate the product of cycle lengths for each one, and add those 24 numbers, and you get 73. You get exactly 73. It's a completely different way to arrive at the same number. It tells you there's some deep structural relationship between partitioning into ordered lists and the cycle structure of permutations. Yeah, that's pretty mind-blowing. Are there others? Oh, yes. There's another interpretation by Dennis P. Walsh involving something called chain gangs. Chain gangs. Sounds intriguing. It does, doesn't it? So for a set S with n elements, a chain gang is basically a way to put a partial order on S where every element is comparable to only elements within its own chain. It's a bit abstract. But the number of distinct chain gangs you can define on a set of size n turns out to be A. For n2, say the set is A, B, there are three chain gangs. One where A and B are unrelated, one where A comes before B, and one where B comes before A. These correspond to the three ways we found earlier. So A, A, B, A, B, B, A, B, B, B, B, A. Okay, I sort of see the parallel to 1, 2, 12, and 21 in a way. It's another structural interpretation. Exactly. It's about how you structure relationships within the set. That's quite theoretical. Is there anything maybe a bit more concrete, something easier to visualize? I think I read one that stuck with me. Ah, you might be thinking of Enrique Navarrete's interpretation. It's a really nice one. He showed that for n0, A n is the number of ways to do this. Take n people, split them into some number of non-empty groups, have each group sit down around a circular table. Then, from each table, select exactly one person. Yes, that's the one. Splitting people into groups, arranging them in circles, and then picking a representative from each circle. The total number of ways you can perform that whole procedure is A n. That just seems so unrelated to ordered lists or permutation cycles or chain gangs. But it produces the same numbers, 1, 3, 13, 73. It really drives home how mathematics finds these unifying patterns. It really does. It's a beautiful illustration of combinatorial equivalence. And beyond these direct interpretations, the sequence itself has some very important mathematical properties and connections to other famous objects. Okay, like what? Well, for one thing, A 000262 is what mathematicians call d-finite. D-finite? What does that signify? It basically means the sequence satisfies a linear recurrence relation with polynomial coefficients. It's a kind of regularity. Specifically, for A 000262, the recurrence is A n, 2
