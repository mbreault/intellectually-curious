## Transcript

Welcome back, everybody. We're diving into the story of a guy you might not know by name, but trust me, he's all over how football looks today. Oh, this is going to be a good one. Clark Shaughnessy. Think of him like a football scientist. Always tinkering, always analyzing. Perfect way to put it. This guy, he didn't just win games. He changed how the game itself is played. And we've got a mountain of articles, historical accounts, the whole deal. We're on a mission to figure out how one man had this huge impact on the sport, you know? All right, so rewind all the way back, Shaughnessy. He starts out in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Minnesota, huh? Yeah. But that was a bit different than coaching in Louisiana heat later on. Oh, yeah. Well, he played at the University of Minnesota, teammate of Bernie Bierman. No kidding? Another legend right there. And even back then, you see how versatile he was? Versatile, how so? Get this. Recruited for the basketball team, never played before in his life. Wow, okay, athletic, but maybe not basketball specific. But wait, there's more. Ends up filling in on the track team too. Replaced a half-mile runner. Hold on, was he some kind of super athlete? Apparently. And he'd never even worn track spikes before. See, that right there, that's the kind of adaptability you see his whole career. It's like he was meant to experiment, you know? And that fearlessness, it went straight into his coaching. I bet. So where did he land his first gig? Oh, this is classic Shaughnessy. First coaching job, triple threat Tulane University 1915. Triple threat? What, like he was coaching three sports? Football, basketball, track. All at once. That's insane. And on top of that, he was also the athletic director. Wow. Talk about a multitasker. This guy was like a one-man athletic department. And even at Tulane, you can see those innovative seeds being planted. Give me an example. What was he doing differently? He introduces the Minnesota shift. Okay, that's ringing a bell. That was like an early version of, what, a moving pocket? It was an early sign that this guy, he's thinking differently about strategy. And how'd it work out for him? Was Tulane any good? By 1919, they were a Southern powerhouse. And then in 1925, undefeated season. Undefeated. So the guy's got talent. He's winning games. Where does he go next? Well, success gets you noticed. And in 1927, he lands at Loyola University, New Orleans. Loyola? Interesting move. Oh, and the salary offer? Get ready for this. Okay, hit me. $175,000. You're kidding. Over 10 years. One of the highest paid coaches in the nation. Oh. Must have been some pressure with that kind of paycheck, huh? I can't even imagine. Every move he made was probably under a microscope. Oh, yeah. Everyone's watching when you're making that kind of money. And in 1928, Loyola nearly upsets Notre Dame. Whoa, hold up. Notre Dame? That's huge. They were the program back then. Yeah. Relatively small school challenging the giants. What did Newt Rockne think of that? He must have been fuming. Actually, even Rockne was impressed with Shaughnessy after that game. Really? Wow, that's high praise coming from Rockne. So now the guy's got talent, wins, he's shaking things up. And then what? Did he stay at Loyola? Nope. He takes on a monster challenge. Replaces the iconic Amos Alonzo Stagg at the University of Chicago, 1933. Replacing a legend. That's never easy. And to make things harder, the university's academic program was tough. Tough? How so? Limited player availability, less practice time. Yikes. Try implementing a complex game plan with those kinds of restrictions. But instead of letting it limit him, this is where the football scientist really comes out. All ears. He starts experimenting even more. Laying the foundation for what will become the modern T formation. The T formation? Wait, didn't he invent that? It's not that simple. The T formation was considered outdated, old news, really. What did he do with it? Shaughnessy, he looks at it with fresh eyes. He sees the potential, how it could work in a changing game. Okay, so less invention, more like evolution. He took something old and made it new. Exactly. And their evolution really takes off in 1940 when he goes to Stanford University. Stanford? They were any good back then. Inherits a team considered one of the worst in the school's history. Oh man. Talk about a challenge. People doubted the hire. Some thought Stanford was trying to get rid of football altogether. Really? They had that little faith in him? Apparently so. Yeah. But Shaughnessy, he was about to prove them wrong. And he did it in style. How'd he pull it off? Frankie Albert at quarterback, he unleashes his reimagined T formation. Undefeated season, Rose Bowl victory. It was one of the biggest turnarounds in college football history. Wow, that's the kind of story they make movies about. And it gets even better. That same year, the Chicago Bears. The Bears. They used the T formation to dominate the NFL championship game. How dominant are we talking? 73 to 0. 73 to 0. Are you serious? That's insane. Coaches all over the country are paying attention now, Shaughnessy. He just sparked a revolution. So he's winning at the college level and his ideas are shaking things up in the pros too. His influence was spreading everywhere. What's wild is that Shaughnessy, he never claimed to invent the T formation. He'd say it was the oldest formation in football. So what made him different? His genius was adapting it, making it relevant again, showing everyone its true potential. We've seen his early years, the incredible turnarounds, the rise of this T formation, and this is just the beginning. There's so much more to this guy's story. There is, and we're going to uncover it all right after this. Can't wait. Last we left off, Shaughnessy's T formation was taking the football world by storm. Yeah, huge wins, changing the game, the whole deal. But here's the thing. He wasn't just some strategist drawing up plays. He was a true innovator. Okay, let's talk about this football scientist side of him. I got to know, what were his methods like back then? Well, get this. He was all about film study. Film study, back then, wasn't it all just grainy footage? Exactly. Long before fancy software, video analysis tools, all that. But Shaughnessy, he saw the power of film. Oh, yeah, he'd spend hours pouring over that footage, breaking down plays, formations, opponent tendencies, everything. So he's basically doing what entire teams of analysts do today, but all by himself. Pretty much. It's crazy to think about the dedication, the patience that must have taken. He must have had no books full of scribbles and diagrams. Oh, absolutely. But he believed that film held the key, you know, to unlocking the secrets of his opponents. Finding those little advantages that could swing a game. Right. It wasn't just about watching the games. It was about dissecting them, finding those hidden patterns. Like some kind of football detective. Yeah. He'd look for anything, alignment, stance, the quarterback's eyes, how a receiver ran his routes. Trying to predict their every move. It was like piecing together a puzzle and all of this before computers and algorithms. Makes his achievements even more impressive, doesn't it? It really does. But film study was just one part of it. He also tracked statistics. Statistics? What kind of stats were they even keeping track of back then? Well, he went beyond those basic box scores. You know, he wanted the deeper trends and patterns. So what was he looking at? Completion percentages, third down conversions, even his own players' preferences for certain plays. Like he was building his own database way before databases were a thing. Exactly. A true data enthusiast before data was even a word. You know what I mean? And it wasn't just about the numbers. It was about understanding his players, tailoring his strategies. Oh, absolutely. He wanted to play to their strengths. This is where those questionnaires come in, right? Didn't he give his players questionnaires? He did. Seems unconventional, right? Yeah. Even for a football scientist, that's pretty out there. But Shaughnessy, he believed that his players' perspectives were valuable, essential even. So these questionnaires, what were they like? He wanted their feedback, how comfortable they felt with different formations, their favorite plays, even their thoughts on their teammates. Wow. So he was actually incorporating their input into his game plan. He was. He wasn't just dictating. He was collaborating, understanding their point of view. That's incredible. It's like a more inclusive, team-oriented approach to coaching way ahead of its time. Totally. And you see that same approach in how he built his coaching staff. Yeah. We talked about some big names earlier, George Hallis, Sid Luckman, even future coaches like Marchmont Schwartz, Phil Binkson. It's like a who's who of football legends. His coaching tree, it's massive. His influence went way beyond his own teams. Oh, for sure. Shaughnessy, he had this knack for attracting talent, developing it. So what were some of those
