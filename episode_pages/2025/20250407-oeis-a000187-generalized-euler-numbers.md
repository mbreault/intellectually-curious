Welcome back to the Deep Dive. It's great to be back. Where we delve into the intricate world of mathematics. Exactly. And for our number theory enthusiasts joining our OEIS exploration. OEIS, yeah. Today we're taking on sequence A00187. Right. Generalized Euler numbers. Yes. And you know the OEIS, as you know, is just this amazing treasure trove of numerical patterns. Absolutely. And the generalized Euler numbers are such an elegant example of how these mathematical concepts are just so beautifully interconnected. They build upon the classical Eulerian numbers and kind of offer a wider view of some of these combinatorial structures. Yeah. So our goal today is to really just give a nice concise introduction to these numbers. Right. Drawing from some of the research that's been done and just highlight what makes them so fascinating. Yeah, definitely. So you know for those who might be familiar with the standard Eulerian numbers, they basically count the number of permutations of n elements that have exactly dollar cents. Right. When we talk about generalized Euler numbers, what exactly are we generalizing here? What's the core idea that we need to grasp from the very beginning? Well at its heart, the generalization extends the way that we actually count these ascent-like patterns. Okay. So the generalized Eulerian number denoted by 1, k, 1 for 0, k, n, 1 can be defined explicitly by this formula. 1, k, 1, j, l, m, k, a, j, and a, a. Yeah. Now this formula might seem a bit abstract at first, but think of it as a way to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to precisely count these permutations with a specific number of ascents. So the alternating sum and the binomial coefficients, they work together to actually filter out those permutations that don't meet the exact criteria for ascents. Oh, that's helpful. Yeah. So that formula gives us a direct way to calculate these generalized numbers. Yeah. Now I understand that Euler himself had a way of looking at these numbers through generating functions. Yes, he did. What did his approach reveal? Right. So Euler, as you know, was a master of generating functions. And he provided an early way to represent and study these numbers through this expression. Okay. Frack G plus FCM, Mado, plus 1, HN, X, Frack G, along with the relation, Sx by 1A plus 1A, N, A, N, A, N, X, and 1, 1. Got it. Now while the first part of this generating function is a bit involved and requires more context on NULLIS, XBRX, and a T-Day, the second part is more directly relevant to us. Okay. It shows that the generalized Eulerian numbers, SBRK, appear as the coefficients of powers of 6 dollars in a polynomial that's related to 1XMaddy. Okay. And generating functions basically package a whole sequence of numbers, like in this case 1NK for a fixed dollar into one single function. Got it. So it makes it easier to manipulate and extract properties. So Euler used these generating functions to understand these numbers better. Right. Has the way we represent them evolved since then? Yes, it has. Is there a more modern, maybe more accessible form? Yes, there is a more contemporary generating function that is widely used today. And it offers a very compact and powerful way to actually encode all of the generalized Eulerian numbers. Okay. And it's given by this. 1 plus sum KU K, 1K1. Yeah. This form is quite elegant because it relates these generalized Eulerian numbers to the exponential function, which is a very fundamental building block in many areas of math. Right. And you can actually see how these coefficients in 1NK are naturally embedded within this structure. It does look pretty powerful. Yeah. Now one of the key benefits of having a generating function is often the ability to derive relationships between terms in the sequence. Exactly. Does this modern generating function help us find a recurrence relation for 1NK? Absolutely. From this generating function, we can derive a crucial recurrence relation. Okay. That tells us how to calculate 1N plus 1K based on the values of 11K based on the values of the previous level, N1K. This relation is 1N plus 1K plus 2NNK1 plus KNNK. And recurrence relations are incredibly valuable because they provide a step-by-step method for computing these terms of the sequence, often revealing these underlying patterns. Right. And as the source notes, this particular recurrence can be derived from the generating function through some careful manipulation of the series. So recurrence relations give us this computational handle on these numbers. Exactly. Now the name Eulerian numbers itself kind of suggests a connection to permutations and their properties like sense. Yeah. Do these generalized numbers retain any of those symmetries that we see in the classical Eulerian numbers? Yes, they do. Just like the standard Eulerian numbers, the generalized Eulerian numbers exhibit a beautiful symmetry. Okay. Dollar NK with AN, NNK plus 1 day. Think about a permutation of non-elements. Okay. If it has dollar cents, what happens if we read it in reverse order? Yeah. Each ascent becomes a descent and each descent becomes an ascent. Okay. So a permutation with the dollar cents read in reverse will have 1NK plus 1 plus 1 involves NKS cents. I see. So this fundamental symmetry in the structure of permutations directly translates to the symmetry we observe in the counts given by the Eulerian numbers, both classical and generalized. It's a very intuitive way to see that symmetry. Yeah. Now our sources also introduced something called limiting Eulerian numbers denoted by C-E-R-N-K-R-N. Okay. The term limiting suggests we're taking some sort of limit. Yeah. What parameter is approaching a limit here? Okay. And what are these T-R-N-K-R numbers all about? Well, this is where the generalization takes another interesting turn. Okay. We introduced this parameter, three dollars, and we define the limiting Eulerian number of order to R-N-T-R-N through this generating function. Okay. Frack R-N-X-R-O. Where C-R-R-X-1 plus X plus by 2 plus dots plus X-R-1-X-day R-N-Math-R-X-D-R-R and 9-X-10-Federal-1. And Math-R-X is a differential operator. Got it. That scales with six dollars. Often appearing in these contexts involving generating functions and combinatorial identities. Okay. The parameter dollar essentially introduces a level to our generalization. That looks significantly more complex than what we've seen so far. Yeah, it can get a little bit intricate. What's the payoff for introducing this dollars in this more intricate generating function? How do these tier gully dollar relate back to the standard Eulerian numbers, the lar dollar that we started with? Well, the fascinating connection is that these limiting Eulerian numbers, C-R-R-A-L-A dollar, are directly linked to the standard Eulerian numbers. Okay. Not the generalized ones we first defined as A-L-R-D-O-G-A-L-A. Right, right. And the relationship is given by this. T-R-N-K-R-N-M1-K-1-A-N-1-K-T. So these C-R-N-K-T are essentially signed versions of the standard Eulerian numbers. I see. Where the parameter in dollars is 9-0-1-1, with a sign that alternates with dollar. Got it. This shows a deeper connection between these seemingly different generalizations of the original Eulerian concept. So the T-R-N-K-R tied to the standard Eulerian numbers. That's right. Now our outline mentions a polynomial GRN-X, X-N-K-W-G-E-X-D-A-X-K-K-A. Yes. What are some key properties of this polynomial? Okay. Why is it useful to define this polynomial based on these T-R-N-K coefficients? Well, GRN-X is a polynomial with some very interesting characteristics. First, its coefficients, the T-R-N-K values, are always integers. Yeah. Second, the degree of this polynomial depends on N and dollars. For one, the degree is 3R, while for 1 and O, the degree becomes nominal and dollar. We also know the values of the first and last coefficients, T-R-N-A-D-R-T-M-A. And for 1 and R dollars, nominal and N-1-1. Okay. By packaging these T-R-N-N-K values into a polynomial, we can leverage the powerful tools of polynomial algebra and analysis to study their properties. Polynomials often have recurrence relations that govern them. Yeah. Does GRN-X also satisfy such a relation? Yes, it does. The polynomial GRN follows this recurrence. GRN plus 1X, X, N, R, YR, GRN, X, X, N, GRN, X, N. Where GRN denote the derivatives with respect to 6 dollars. Okay. This recurrence allows us to generate these polynomials iteratively, building up from lower values of dollars. Got it. And it highlights how the structure of GRN at one level is related to its derivative and the function at the next level. We discussed the symmetry of Wham-N. Yes. Do the limiting Eulerian numbers, TRN, KR, also exhibit any form of symmetry? Yes, they do have a symmetry property, although it involves the parameter dollar. Right. The symmetry is given by CRN, K, or it is C1N, KR, in RK. Got it. This tells us that the coefficients of the polynomial GRN, X, are related in a very specific way. Okay. With a possible sign change depending on dollar between terms that are equidistant from
