## Description

A concise tour of how a two-stroke symbol moved from peso ledgers to the US dollar and onto currencies named dollar or peso. We weigh the main origin theories, peek at printing-era experiments, and explore the cifr√£o‚Äôs unique role as decimal separator in Portuguese-speaking worlds. A quick dive into history, tradition, and the digital age.

## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive. Great to be here. Today, we're tackling something you see constantly but maybe don't think too much about. The dollar sign. That. Exactly. We're going to explore its history, where it came from, and all the surprising ways it's used. Right. We've looked into historical documents, different theories, even how it pops up in coding. The goal is, you know, to give you those aha moments without getting too bogged down. It's a symbol everyone recognizes. Probably thinks of money straight away. Sure. Finance is key. But its story goes way beyond that, right into the digital age. So the big question is, how did this little mark, this squiggle, become so ubiquitous? And what does its journey tell us? Let's dive in. Okay. Origins. The sources point to it showing up in, like, the 1770s business letters and stuff. Yeah, mainly linked to the Spanish-American peso. Which people also call the Spanish dollar or piece of eight. That's the one. It was common currency in Spanish America, the early US, even Britain. And that Spanish coin was actually the model for the US dollar, wasn't it? It was, yeah. The Coinage Act of 1792 specifically based the US dollar on it. But here's a kicker. The first US dollar coins, they didn't have the sign on them. Nope. It took some time to catch on in print here. The first printed example is maybe, what, the 1790s? Archibald Binney, a printer? That's the claim, yeah. Philadelphia printer. And later I saw something about an 1869 banknote. Oh yeah, the $1 United States note. It had this interesting overlapping US. Kind of like a monogram. Sort of. And right next to it, a tiny double-stroke dollar sign. Almost like we were trying things out. Okay, so how did we get the symbol? The main theory seems pretty logical. You mean the IPS connection? Yeah, the abbreviation for pesos, people writing it quickly. Exactly. The idea is the IPS started getting written sort of over the P. And it just morphed over time. Gradually becoming what we recognize. There's even a letter from 1778. Oliver Pollock. That's him. An Irish trader. His IPS looks remarkably like an early dollar sign. And get this, Portuguese documents from 1775. Even earlier. Yeah, they apparently already showed the two-stroke version being used commonly. Wow. So that version was around before the US even had its own dollar. It really makes you think about how these things just emerge from practical use, doesn't it? Definitely. Commerce drives notation. But, like with any old symbol, there are other ideas floating around. Ah, the alternative theories. Like the pillars of Hercules one. That sounds cool. It does. It connects the sign to the design on those Spanish pieces of eight. The coins had pillars on them. Yeah, representing the Strait of Gibraltar. Often shown with a ribbon kind of wrapped around them in an S shape. Oh, I can picture that. The two strokes are the pillars and the S is the ribbon. That's the hypothesis. It's visually quite compelling. And didn't the Chinese have a name for Spanish dollars related to that? They did, yeah. Shang-Zhu, meaning double pillar. Which is pretty suggestive, you know. It really is. Is there anything else linked to the coins? Well, related to that, there's a focus on the Potosi Mint in Bolivia. Huge silver source back then, right? Massive. Their mint mark was often P-T-S-I, all superimposed. Like mashed together? Kinda. And some researchers think the core of that mark looks like a single-stroke dollar sign. Hmm. So P-S, pillars, Potosi Mint mark. Quite a few contenders from the Spanish connection. But wait, there's more. Of course there is. A German link. How does that fit? It comes down to the word dollar itself. Right. Not originally English. No, it comes via the Dutch dolder from the German Joachimstaller, often just called toller. Another big silver coin in Europe. Exactly. So one theory is the sign came from an S superimposed on an I or maybe a J. Representing the toller? Potentially. There's a symbol like that in a merchant's accounting book from 1686. Wow, that's quite early. And another less common idea links it to a snake and cross emblems sometimes seen on dollars. Man, this symbol has a complicated family tree. It certainly seems that way. But not all the branches are considered equally strong today. Yeah, you mentioned some theories are less likely now. Debunked, maybe? Well, debunked is strong, but less favored, definitely. Like the idea that Robert Morris specifically adopted the two-stroke sign in 1778. An American revolutionary figure. Right. Alton James proposed that in 1937. But the evidence from the period isn't really there to back it up firmly. What about that Greek letter idea? Psi and S? That was H.M. Larson in 1939. It hasn't really gained much traction either. Seems a bit convoluted compared to the Eves theory. Okay. And the one that feels kind of intuitive, the U over S for United States? Ah, yes, the monogram theory. You can see why people suggest it. It looks plausible, right? A narrow U on an S. Visually, sure. It is mentioned back in the 1870s. Even Ayn Rand used it in Atlas Shrugged. She did, huh? Yeah. She suggested it was used on US mint money bags. But historically... The timing's off again? Pretty much. The dollar sign symbol seems to predate the US explanation gaining any real currency, so to speak. Gotcha. Then there were those darker connections mentioned in the sources. Right. The potential link to branding practices in Spanish territories. For enslaved people. Yes. Tatiana Sages and Jake Frederick noted a symbol like a one-bar dollar sign was sometimes used. They suggest a possible link to esclaveau, meaning slave, and clovo, meaning nail. That's sobering. It is. And there's also a Portuguese theory linking the Sefraun's bars to the pillars of Hercules again, but the S to Tariq ibn Ziyad's conquest route in 711. Okay, those are definitely out there. They bring up important history, but compared to the Epp's evidence and the coin imagery, they're generally seen as less likely origins for the symbol itself. Right. So focusing back on the main symbol, lots of currencies use it today, not just the US. Oh, absolutely. It's the go-to symbol for most currencies named dollar and many named peso. Except the Philippines. They have their own, right? They do. The year symbol. Good point. And to avoid confusion, especially internationally. You often see prefixes, yeah. Yeah. US, E, CAA, AU, OR, or sometimes suffixes like CAN. But for really clear professional stuff... It's the ISO 427 codes, USD, MXN, AUD, CAD, etc. No ambiguity there. Makes sense. And looking back, it was used for currencies that aren't even around anymore. Loads of them. The Brazilian Cruzeiro had variations like Euro. The Ethiopian Birr used A for a while. Macanese Pataca, Nicaraguan Cordoba, Samoan Tala. Pongan Palanga, the old Malayan dollar, Malaysian Ringgit used it. Even the South Vietnamese Dong, it really got around. It's like the symbol itself became a global standard for a certain type of currency unit. In many ways, yes. Now, how about writing it? You usually put it before the number, right? Like $10? Yeah, that feels normal to me. That's the standard in the US, Mexico, Australia, English-speaking Canada. Lots of places. But not everywhere. Interestingly, no. In French-speaking Canada, it often comes after. $10. Huh. Like percentages. Kinda, yeah. And the cent sign, that almost always comes after, like $5. Little regional quirks. Now, you mentioned the Portuguese name for the two-stroke version earlier. The cifr√£o. Yes, the cifr√£o. That one has a really unique history in the Portuguese-speaking world. It wasn't just for currency identification? Not originally, no. In Portugal and Brazil, for their old currency, the real, it was used as a thousand separator. A thousand separator? Like a comma? Exactly like a comma in function. So you might see $123,500, meaning 123,500 races. That's wild, and that dates back pretty far. At least to 1775, based on documents. Wow, but then its job changed. It did. In 1911, Portugal switched to the escudo, and the cifr√£o became the decimal separator. So $123.50 meant 123 and a half escudos. Precisely. $123.50, they used that right up until they adopted the euro in 2002. Fascinating. Has anyone kept using it that way? Cape Verde has. They introduced their escudo in 1914, also a former Portuguese colony, and they still use the cifr√£o as the decimal separator today. Still? That's commitment. It is. And other former colonies like East Timor, Angola, Mozambique used it that way for their escudos for a time, too. Even Brazil kept a link after they switched currencies. Well, when they went to the Cruzeiro in 1942, they officially used a comma for decimals, writing QR, but the symbol itself was often still drawn with two strokes. Old habits, perhaps. In Vietnam, too, using it as a separator. South Vietnam
