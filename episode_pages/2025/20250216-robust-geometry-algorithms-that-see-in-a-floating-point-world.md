## Transcript

Welcome back to our computer science series. Always a pleasure to be here. We're getting deeper into algorithms and data structures. That's right. And today we're going even deeper into... Doing where no one has gone before. Well, maybe not that far, but into a field. It's a fascinating field. Where math and computer science really come together. Yeah, they collide. Computational geometry. That's it. So designing algorithms... Yeah, algorithms to solve... To solve geometric problems. Like in the digital world. So we're talking shapes. Shapes, points, lines. That's right. And this stuff is everywhere. Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, you think about it, like computer graphics. Of course. Robotics, for example. Oh, robotics, for sure. GPS navigation. Yeah. All rely on computational geometry. Yeah, and a lot of people don't even realize that. They don't think about it. Nope. And for this deep dive, we've got a bunch of research papers. That's right. Some Wikipedia articles. Some good stuff. So are you ready to explore how computers... How they... How they see and manipulate... How they... Shapes, I guess. Absolutely. That's good. I'm glad you're ready. Always. I'm ready, too. One of the most... Yeah. I think one of the most fascinating things about this is this concept of robustness. Okay. You see a lot of computational geometry algorithms. Okay. They're designed with this assumption that... Assumption. Computers can work with, like, perfect... Oh, perfect numbers. Infinitely precise numbers. Like in a perfect world? Yeah, the ideal scenario. Okay. But for the real world... Reality. That's not the case. Right. So what happens? Computers use approximations. Approximations, so like... Like floating point numbers. Okay, yeah. And floating point numbers, they're great for, like, a wide range of values, but... They got their limitations. They do. They introduce these tiny rounding errors. Rounding errors. Yeah. Which, they sound tiny, maybe not a big deal. Right. They might seem insignificant at first, but they can lead to big problems. So it's like, how do you deal with these errors? Yeah. How do we ensure our algorithms give accurate results? Yeah, that's a good question. That's where robustness comes in. Okay, so robustness is like... Robustness. Is like the solution to that problem? It is. It can handle these imperfections in the real world and still give you reliable answers. Like it can, like, overcome... Yeah. Or, like, work around those rounding errors. Yeah. Okay, I'm starting to see. I think an example will help. Yeah, an example would be good. Let's imagine you're trying to determine if a point is on the left side... Oh, okay, left or right. Yeah, left or right side of a line. Like on a computer screen. On your computer screen, exactly. That seems pretty... Pretty straightforward, right. You just look at the coordinates. But those coordinates are... Oh, I see where you're going. They're represented by floating point numbers. Okay. So a fragile algorithm, one that's not robust... Okay. It might get thrown off. Thrown off by... By the rounding errors. Yeah. And it might classify points that are clearly on one side... Oh, so it would be like... As being on the line. Like a line cutting through a cluster of points... Exactly. But instead of it being like a clean division... Right. You've got, like, points... Scattered. Yeah, scattered all over the place. Randomly. Like not making any sense. Yeah, like on the line. Yeah. Even though they shouldn't be. So it's not just a theoretical issue. It's like it has real world... Absolutely. Visual consequences. Visual output. Yeah. Yeah, it can affect that. Okay. Absolutely. And a seemingly small error... Yeah. Can have a ripple effect. Ripple effect, yeah. And cause problems in more complex algorithms... That rely on that. That rely on that basic calculation. I see. So robustness is like... It's like building a safety net... Yes. Into your algorithms. Exactly. To help them, like... And make them more resilient. In the digital world. Exactly. And reliable. Okay, I'm starting to get it. Especially important in computational geometry. Okay. Where tiny errors... Yeah. Can snowball into big problems. Okay, I'm convinced. Robustness is key. Robustness is key. I'm sold. All right. What other examples? Sure. Well, let's talk about calculating a... Okay. A convex hull. Convex hull? Yeah. A convex hull is basically the smallest... Okay. Shape... The smallest shape. That encloses a set of points. Oh, okay. So it's... Like if you took a rubber band... Yeah. And wrapped it around a bunch of points... Okay. That's the convex hull. I see. And think of it as like the most efficient route around obstacles. Okay, so like robotics. Exactly. Or pathfinding or something like that. Right. Very useful. Okay, that makes sense. Now, there are algorithms for finding the convex hull. Uh-huh. But a fragile algorithm might produce a shape that's... Not convex. That isn't actually convex. I see. So imagine you have a set of points. Okay. Like forming a square. Okay, yeah, a square. A fragile algorithm could create a shape with... Like dents or inward curve. Oh, it's not really... Which by definition... A perfect square. It's not a convex hull. Oh, wow. So that's a great example because it really highlights how these, like... These tiny rounding errors. Yeah, seemingly minor... Issue. Can lead to unexpected... Yeah. Disastrous results. And you wouldn't even know. Right. Necessary. Unless you're really looking for them. Okay. So that's why robustness is so crucial. It's crucial. In computational geometry. Yeah. It makes sure that our algorithms are reliable. Yeah. And produce accurate results. Even though there's all these... Even in the face of... Like limitations in how... The inherent... Numbers are represented digitally. Limitations. Digital representation. Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense. Good, good. So I'm really starting to grasp this whole... Good. Importance of robustness. Good. But I'm also curious... Yeah. About how computers actually represent numbers. That's a great question. Like in the first place. That's a great question. Right, because we take it for granted. Do. So like, how does that work? There are a few different ways. Or a few different ways. Each with its own... Each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Okay, well let's dive into that. Right. So we were talking about floating point numbers. We were. And rounding errors. Yeah. But can you, I don't know, break it down for us a little bit? Break it down. Like how computers represent numbers in general. Oh, the most common types are integers. Okay. Fixed point numbers. Uh-huh. And then floating point numbers. Okay. Which we've been talking about. Right. Integers are whole numbers. Okay. So like one, two, three. One, two, two. Okay, got it. Yeah. And fixed point numbers. Fixed point. So that's... They're basically decimals. But with a fixed number of digits after the decimal point. So like dollars and cents? Exactly, like financial calculations. Got it. But the workhorse of computational geometry. Yeah. And really a lot of computing. Uh-huh. Is the floating point number. Floating point number. Yeah. And you said those are the ones... Those are the ones... That can cause those rounding errors. They can lead to those pesky rounding errors. Yeah. So can you give us an example? Sure. Imagine... Like a simple example. Imagine you're adding and subtracting very large numbers. Okay, adding, subtracting big numbers. Because of the way floating point numbers are stored, the order in which you do those operations can actually change the result. Really? It's like... I did not know that. It's like a mathematical game of telephone. Oh. Where the message gets distorted... A little bit each time. A little bit each time. Okay, so how do you deal with these rounding errors? Right. Like do you just have to accept them? You don't have to accept them. Okay. There are some clever strategies. Trying to be. For minimizing or even eliminating... Eliminating them. These errors. All right, like what... One approach is to use something called extended number systems. Extended number systems, what is that? So things like... Big numbers. Big numbers, okay. Rational numbers. Even symbolic computation. Symbolic computation. Yeah. So you're bringing in like the big guns of math. Exactly. To take care of these tiny little... To tackle these tiny... Errors. Errors. Yeah, they allow for more precise calculations. Okay. But there's a trade-off. Trade-off. There's always a trade-off in life. Always. They can be much slower. Slower. And require more computational power. More juice. Yeah. Okay. More resources. Yeah. So it's like more accurate. More accurate. But slower. Okay, so is there a way to like... To find a balance. Yeah, a happy medium. There is. Okay. One technique is using floating point filters. Floating point filters? Yeah, think of them as a first line of defense. Okay. Against rounding errors. Against rounding errors. Got it. The key insight is that we often don't need the exact value of a mathematical expression. Okay. In many computational geometry algorithms, we just need to know the sign. The sign? Like positive, negative, or zero. Okay. So to determine if a point is left or right of a line... Okay, yeah, yeah. We just
