## Description

We explore A001168, the counting sequence for rooted planar maps with n edges. The nth term is A_n = 2 Â· 3^n Â· (2n)! / (n! (n+2)!). We unpack why this simple closed form hints at deep structure, its duality connection to rooted 4-regular planar maps, and the surprising web of related objects (doodles, lambda calculus, well-labeled trees, and the Tamari lattice) highlighted by Noam Zeilberger. We also touch on the integral representation as the nth moment of a positive function and what the asymptotics tell us about the growth and underlying analytic structure of these maps.

## Transcript

All right, so today we're taking a deep dive into an OEIS sequence that I think is going to be really intriguing, especially for anyone out there who's into number theory. You ready for this? Always ready for a good sequence. What have we got? All right, so it's AO00168. And like I said, this one's going to be particularly interesting for number theory folks because it's all about these things called rooted planar maps. Oh, rooted planar maps. Classic. Those are always fun to think about. They're surprisingly deep, you know? Yeah, and that's what I think is so cool about this sequence because at first glance, it seems pretty simple. An counts how many rooted planar maps you can make with exactly n edges. Right. Pretty straightforward. Straightforward concept. And it even has this really nice formula. An equals 2 times 3 to the n times 2n factorial, all divided by n factorial times n plus 2 factorial. Yeah, exactly. Which, you know, that formula itself is kind of a giveaway that there's something more going on here, right? Like all those factorials? Come on, that's not an accident. It's hinting at some deeper structure, some way these maps are built up. Absolutely. Factorials usually scream combinatorics. And in this case, they're telling us there's a story about how these maps are put together, piece by piece, from simpler elements. And it's not just the formula that's intriguing. What's really wild is how this sequence shows up in all these seemingly unrelated places. Like you see it with four regular planar maps. You see it with these crazy self-intersecting curves they call doodles, where it counts how many doodles you can make with n crossings. Don't forget lambda calculus. Oh yeah, lambda calculus too. Specifically, it has something to do with the shapes of those closed normal linear lambda terms. And then there's well-labeled trees. Like, how are all these things connected to counting maps on a surface? Right, it's a real testament to the interconnectedness of mathematics, how one simple sequence can be like a bridge between these different worlds. And it's not just random connections either. There's this mathematician, Noam Zeilberger, who's done some fantastic work showing how 800168 fits into this whole network of related sequences. Oh really? What kind of sequences are we talking about here? Well, there are sequences related to planar maps, obviously, but also things like the Tamari lattice and lambda calculus, as I mentioned. We're talking about A000260, A0000698, A0000698, A0000698, A00062980, even 867827. It's really remarkable, this whole web of interconnectedness he's uncovered. Wow, that's a lot of connections. I'm going to have to check those out. And then on top of all that, the OEIS also mentions this integral representation for the sequence, which is kind of blowing my mind. It says it's the nth moment of some positive function. I mean, what does that even mean in this context? Like, we're counting maps and suddenly we're talking about integrals and analysis. Right, it's a bit of a jump, but it's actually a really powerful clue. When you see a combinatorial sequence popping up as the moments of a probability distribution, it often means there's some deeper analytical structure going on, some connection to random processes maybe. Huh. So, like, maybe the way these rooted planar maps grow and behave is governed by similar principles that show up in, like, continuous phenomena? Exactly. That's the kind of thing that mathematicians get really excited about, these unexpected connections between seemingly different areas. Okay, so clearly there's a lot to unpack here. But before we get too deep into the weeds, let's just back up and make sure everyone's on the same page. What exactly are we talking about when we say rooted planar map? Right, good point. So let's start with planar graph. A planar graph is just any graph that you can draw on a flat surface, like a piece of paper, without any of the edges crossing each other. Simple enough, right? Yeah, I think everyone's familiar with the idea of a graph and drawing it without crossings. Good. Now, a plain graph is just one specific way to draw a planar graph without those crossings. But here's where it gets interesting. A planar map takes that idea and moves it onto the surface of a sphere. Onto a sphere, huh? Okay, I'm following. Basically, think of it like this. You have your planar graph, and you can imagine drawing it on a flexible sheet. Now, wrap that sheet around a sphere, and boom, you've got yourself a planar map. So it's like taking the graph and sort of inflating it onto a sphere, but without letting any of the edges cross. Exactly. And the key difference here is that in a planar map, there's no special outside region like you have on a flat piece of paper. Every face of the map is treated equally. Okay, I see. It's about the graph's structure on the sphere itself, not a particular drawing on a flat surface with some arbitrary outer face. Gotcha. But what about rooted? The OEIS description mentions rooted planar maps with n edges. Ah, yes, rooted. That's a crucial detail. Rooting a map essentially means you pick one special edge and give it a direction, like an arrow. Why do we do that? What's the point of picking that special edge? It's all about avoiding double counting. See, without a root, you could rotate or flip the map around, and it would still be the same map, just in a different orientation. But by rooting it, you're fixing a specific reference point. So any two maps that look the same after you rotate or flip them are considered the same map if they also have the same root. Oh, I see. So it's like marking a starting point on a map so you don't get lost. It helps us define exactly what we're counting. Precisely. And remember, we're focusing on maps with a specific number of edges, not necessarily vertices. Right, that's important. So we've got our rooted planar maps defined. Now let's go back to that formula. An equals 2 times 3 to the n times 2n factorial, all divided by n factorial times n plus 2 factorial. How do we even begin to make sense of that? Well, the first thing that jumps out at a combinatorialist like myself is the presence of those Catalan numbers lurking in there. Catalan numbers, those are those things that pop up everywhere in combinatorics, right? Exactly. They count all sorts of things. Binary trees, dick paths, triangulations of polygons, you name it. And in this formula, you can see them if you rearrange it a bit. So how does that work? Well, you can rewrite the formula as An equals 2 times 3 to the n times Cn, all over n plus 2, where Cn represents the nth Catalan number, which is 1 over n plus 1 times 2n choose n. Ah, so the Catalan numbers are like a hidden ingredient in this formula. What does that tell us? It hints at a deeper connection. It suggests there might be a way to build rooted planar maps using these other Catalan-related structures. Maybe there's a step-by-step process, or maybe we can decompose a map into pieces that are counted by Catalan numbers. It's like a breadcrumb trail leading us to a hidden relationship. Wow, that's pretty cool. So this sequence isn't just some isolated thing. It's connected to this whole world of Catalan objects. And what about that asymptotic formula we saw in the OEIS, the one that goes An is roughly equal to 2 times 12 to the n, all divided by this whole mess of n squared plus 3n times the square root of pi times n. What does that tell us? That formula tells us about how fast the number of rooted planar maps grows as the number of edges gets bigger. The key part is that 12 to the n, which means that the number of maps explodes exponentially as n increases. So like the more edges we add, the more possibilities we have, and the number of maps just goes crazy. Precisely. It's a bit like compound interest. The more you have, the faster it grows. And those other terms in the denominator, the n squared and square root stuff, they give us more precise information about how that growth is shaped. Okay, so the formula tells us these maps multiply like rabbits. But the OEIS also mentions some other really unexpected connections. Like it says, this sequence counts rooted 4 regular planar maps with n vertices. Can you remind me what a 4 regular graph is again? Sure. A 4 regular graph is just a graph where every single vertex has exactly 4 edges connected to it. Okay, 4 edges per vertex. Got it. But what does that have to do with our rooted planar maps with n edges? It all comes down to this really cool concept called duality. Imagine you have a planar map drawn on a sphere. Now picture putting a dot in each face of that map. Those dots become the vertices of a new graph, which we call the dual graph. Okay, I'm visualizing that. So each face of the original map gets a dot, which becomes a vertex in the dual graph. Exactly. Now if two faces in the original map share an edge, we draw an edge between their corresponding dots in the dual graph. So the edges in the dual graph basically cut across the edges in the original map. Huh, that's neat. It is. And the really cool thing is that the dual of a planar map is also a planar map. But here's the kicker. If the original map has n edges, then the dual map has n vertices, and it turns out to be 4 regular. Whoa, that's wild. So by
