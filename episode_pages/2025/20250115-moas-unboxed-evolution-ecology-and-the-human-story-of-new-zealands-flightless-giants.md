## Description

An educational podcast for evolutionary biology students. We trace the moa's deep-time evolution, ecological role as dominant herbivores, and the surprising shift in their family treeâ€”closest living relatives to tinamous. From island geology and glacial cycles to trackways, gastroliths, and niche partitioning, we explore how moa shaped their world and what their interactions with humans mean today, including the provocative idea of reviving the species. Based on Wikipedia excerpts and a moa timeline and caste summary.

## Transcript

Welcome to our deep dive into the fascinating world of the moa, specifically for evolutionary biology students like yourself. Indeed. We're going to be drawing from excerpts from the Wikipedia page on moa and a moa timeline and caste summary. Right. And our mission today is to really kind of explore their evolutionary journey, their relationship with humans, and even dive into the possibility of their revival. Yeah, it's a captivating story that touches upon many key concepts in evolutionary biology, you know, from adaptation and speciation to extinction and the delicate balance of ecosystems. So let's just start by painting a picture, you know, for our listeners of what these extinct birds were like. Okay. Like imagine New Zealand just dominated by giant flightless birds. Right. Some the size of a turkey, but others towering over 12 feet tall. Wow. That's the incredible size range that we're talking about, from the bush moa to the massive deinornis robustus and deinornis novozelandiae. Right. And they weren't just big birds. They were really unique in many ways. Unlike other ratites like ostriches or emus, moa were completely wingless, which is a testament to their adaptation to this predator-free environment. Wow. They were the dominant herbivores shaping the landscape and vegetation of New Zealand for millions of years. That's incredible. So as an evolutionary biology student, you're probably familiar with the concept of convergent evolution. Right. Where unrelated species develop similar traits in response to similar environments. Yeah. Moa with their powerful legs and large bodies might seem like a classic example. Absolutely. Especially when we compare them to other flightless birds. Uh-huh. However, their family tree holds a really surprising twist. Yeah. For years, scientists grouped moa with other ratites like kiwi, emus, and cassowaries, just assuming a close evolutionary relationship. Right. Makes sense. But genetic studies revealed a totally different story. Wow. Their closest living relatives are actually the tinamous of South America. Tinamous? Yeah. Those are small flighted birds. Right. That's crazy. It's really a fascinating example of how genetic analysis can upend our assumptions about evolutionary relationships based solely on physical characteristics. Right. It also raises some really intriguing questions about how and when moa ancestors arrived in New Zealand and how they lost their ability to fly. Yeah. How'd that happen? Well, that's where New Zealand's dynamic geological history comes into play. Around 22 million years ago, an event called the Oligocene Drowning Maximum submerged most of New Zealand. Wow. Leaving only small fragments of land above water. Okay. So moa lineages likely clung to survival on these remaining islands. Right. Potentially explaining why all moa species that we know of seem to have originated from the South Island. It's amazing to think that they were able to weather such a dramatic event. Yeah. And then around 6 million years ago, the Southern Alps began to rise. Right. Further fragmenting the landscape and creating a mosaic of different habitats. Yeah. And this geological upheaval likely played a significant role in moa diversification. Okay. How so? Well, you know, isolated populations adapted to specific environments, from dense forests to open grasslands to the, you know, challenging conditions of the alpine zones, leading to the evolution of this diverse range of moa species that we see in the fossil record. It's really cool how, you know, the landscape can just totally change the evolution of these animals. Absolutely. And it wasn't just mountain building that shaped their evolution. The Pleistocene glacial cycles with their fluctuating temperatures and ice sheets also exerted selective pressures on moa populations. Yeah. And as you know, glacial cycles can drive these rapid changes in species distributions and adaptations. Sure. So during glacial periods, larger moa species might have had an advantage in colder environments due to their lower surface area to volume ratio, which helps conserve heat. Right. Conversely, interglacial periods might have favored smaller, more agile species that could thrive in more diverse and fragmented habitats. So it's like a constant back and forth. Indeed. Between the, you know, the different glacial periods. Yeah. And the animals that are best suited for them. It's a fantastic example of how environmental changes can drive both speciation and variations in body size within a lineage. Right. Which are concepts you've likely explored in your evolutionary biology studies. Absolutely. And speaking of size. Yeah. There's another intriguing aspect of moa evolution that initially puzzled scientists. Uh-huh. Sexual dimorphism. So in many moa species, particularly the dinornis. Right. Males and females were strikingly different in size. Wow. Initially, these size differences led to misclassifications with males and females being identified as separate species. Oh, wow. It wasn't until genetic analysis were available that scientists realized the extent of this sexual dimorphism. Could you give us an idea of like just how dramatic these size differences were? Yeah. So in dinornis, for example, females could be up to 150% taller. What? And an astonishing 280% heavier than males. That's crazy. This extreme dimorphism likely played a significant role in their breeding behavior and social structure, something we'll delve into a bit later. Yeah. But first, let's shift our focus to the fascinating details of moa lifestyle and ecology. Absolutely. We've covered how they evolved and diversified, but now I'm eager to understand how they actually lived. What did their daily lives look like? Yeah, let's get into that. So let's step back in time and imagine the forests and plains of prehistoric New Zealand just teeming with moa. And as evolutionary biology students, you understand that behavior rarely fossilizes. Right. But thankfully, we have some tantalizing clues. For instance, fossilized footprints or what we call trackways have been found in various locations, including riverbeds and even underwater in Lake Taupo. Underwater footprints. That's incredible. It sounds like these footprints were preserved in sediments that were later submerged, providing a snapshot of moa movements from a distant past. Exactly. What can these trackways tell us about how moa moved? Well, these footprints revealed that moa, despite their size, were surprisingly agile. The spacing suggests they walked at a reasonable pace, about 3 to 5 kilometers per hour. Plus, their gait was relatively narrow, meaning they placed their feet almost one in front of the other. Okay. Allowing for efficient long-distance travel. That's fascinating how much information we can glean from simple footprints. Speaking of long-distance travel, what fueled these journeys as large herbivores? They must have had quite an appetite. Right. You know, in your studies, you've likely explored the relationship between an animal's diet and its digestive system. And in the case of moa, scientists have examined fossilized gizzard contents and well-fossilized droppings to understand their diet. Yeah. These less glamorous remnants, known as coprolites, provide a wealth of information. For sure. They show us that moa were dedicated herbivores with diverse palates, consuming a variety of leaves, twigs, fruits, and seeds. They browsed on low-lying vegetation and likely grazed on ferns and grasses as well. It sounds like they were truly shaping the plant life around them. Were there any plants that they seemed to favor or did they just kind of eat whatever was available? Well, there's evidence of specialization among some moa species, for example. The heavy-footed moa pachyornis elephantopus had a beak that was perfectly adapted for clipping tough, fibrous plants like New Zealand flax. Wow. This specialization likely minimized competition between different moa species, allowing them to coexist in the same environments. It's a great example of niche partitioning, a concept you've undoubtedly encountered in your studies on competition and resource utilization. But moa weren't just passive consumers. Their feeding habits likely influenced the evolution of New Zealand's flora as well. Absolutely. In the absence of large mammals, moa acted as the primary seed dispersers for many plants. This role likely shaped the distribution and even the morphology of certain plant species. Have you encountered devaricating plants in your studies? Yes, they have a distinctive growth habit with tangled branches and small, widely spaced leaves. Exactly. Some botanists believe that this devaricating structure evolved as a defense against moa browsing. It's like a natural barbed wire fence. Making it difficult for moa to access the leaves, it highlights the fascinating interplay between herbivores and plants in shaping evolutionary trajectories. It's a remarkable example of coevolution now. To process all that plant matter, moa, like many birds, relied on gastroliths. These stones swallowed by the birds act like a mill inside their gizzards, grinding up tough plant material. What's fascinating is the size of some of these gastroliths, reaching up to 110 millimeters long. It's a testament to the volume and toughness of the plant matter they consumed. And they weren't just swallowing any stones. They often chose the hardest quartz pebbles, ensuring maximum grinding efficiency. It highlights the selective pressures that drive even seemingly mundane aspects of an animal's anatomy and behavior. For sure. Now, shifting gears a bit, let's talk about moa's social lives. Did they pair up, raise families? Their extreme sexual dimorphism hints at some interesting breeding dynamics. You're right. The size differences between males and females strongly suggest unique breeding behaviors. Research indicates that in most moa species, the smaller males were responsible for incubating the eggs. While the larger females focused on producing those massive eggs. That's a reversal of the pattern seen in many bird species where both parents share incubation duties. This division of labor likely reflects the energy demands of producing and incubating such large eggs. It also raises the question of whether moa formed pair bonds or had more fluid mating systems. There's still some debate about the extent of pair bonding in moa. Evidence suggests that they weren't colonial nesters like some bird species, meaning they didn't congregate in large groups to breed.
