## Description

Join us as we explore OEIS A000195, the floor of the natural logarithm. We unpack how floor(ln n) climbs in a staircase at n = e^k, connect it to base-e ‚Äúdigits‚Äù and related sequences like A004233 and A000193‚ÄìA000196, and discuss why it defies Benford‚Äôs law. We‚Äôll peek at practical code in Maple, Mathematica, and PARI/GP to generate terms and probe a 2024 conjecture by Joseph Shemia, plus the role of Sloan as curator and the offset. It‚Äôs a concise tour of an apparently simple sequence that reveals rich structure and cross-links across number theory.

## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive. We're here to explore, well, some really fascinating corners of mathematics. That's right, especially for those of you diving into number theory. Exactly. And if you are, you've probably come across the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, the OEIS. Oh, absolutely. An indispensable resource, a real roadmap, like you said. So today we thought we'd zoom in on one sequence, kind of a fundamental one, actually, OEIS sequence A000195. Hmm, a good choice. It's defined quite simply. AN is the floor of the logarithm of N. So floor log, okay. And the first few terms, just to get a feel for it, they go 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, and so on. You see that pattern. Starts slow, then holds values for a bit before ticking up. Now the logarithm base, it's not explicitly stated in the entry, is it? No, it isn't. But the standard convention, especially in these contexts, is usually the natural logarithm, base E. Right, base E about 2.718. So we'll assume that for our discussion. It feels right for this kind of sequence. Agreed. And interestingly, the OEIS entry tags this one as easy. Easy, huh? Which suggests it's foundational, a building block, maybe. I think that's exactly the idea. It's simple to define, but as we'll see, it connects to quite a bit. It's a good starting point. Okay, let's unpack that definition then. AN, floor log. Can you give us a quick refresher on the floor function? What's it doing here? Sure. The floor function is pretty straightforward, really. You take a real number and you just round it down. Down? Always down, to the nearest integer that's less than or equal to your number. So floor of, say, 4.9 is 4, floor of 5 is just 5. Okay, drops off the decimal part, basically. Exactly. So looking at the start of the sequence again, 0, 0. Why does it begin like that? For N1 and N2? Well, it comes directly from the logarithm. The natural log of 1 is exactly 0. Ah, okay. And the floor of 0 is, well, 0. Then for N2, the natural log is about 0.693. So less than 1. Right. So the floor function rounds it down to 0 again. It's only when we get to N3 that it changes. Precisely. Log 3 is about 1.098. So its floor is 1. That's the first time it hits 1. Got it. And then it stays at 1 for a while. Looking at the terms, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, all give 1. Correct. Log 7 is roughly 1.946, still floors to 1. So the jump to 2 must happen at N8. That's the one. Log 8 is about 2.079. Floor that, you get 2. And this pattern continues, right? How is it connected to the base e? It's directly tied to powers of e. The sequence value becomes k when n is roughly between e^k and e^(k+1). Oh, okay. Is 1 roughly between e^0, which is 1, and e^1, about 2.718, hence n1, 2. Right. It's 1 between roughly e^1 and e^2, which is about 7.389. So that covers n3 up to 7. And then 2 kicks in around e^2, which is why n8 starts the value 2. Exactly. The floor function makes those boundaries integers, but the underlying engine is the powers of e. That clarifies the growth pattern really well. Now, the OEIS page mentions connections to other sequences. It says A000195 is A004233, n1, for n1. Yes, that's an interesting link. A004233 is related to the number of digits of n when written in base e. Kind of an unusual base, but... Base e digits, how does that work? Think about base 10 digits relating to powers of 10. Base e digits relate to powers of e. The floor of the base e logarithm basically tells you the exponent of the highest power of e needed, which is related to the number of digits. So E004233 is essentially floor log n plus 1, if you adjust slightly. So our sequence, floor log n, is just one less than that number of e digits count for n1. Pretty much, yeah. It highlights that link between logarithms and the size of a number in a given base. Very neat. And it also cross-references A000193 and A000193 and A00523. Exactly. A000193, that one's about the number of prime factors of n, counted with multiplicity. Omega, often called. Okay, that connection seems less obvious. It does seem more subtle, yeah. The OEIS doesn't spell it out. But these cross-references are like clues. They suggest that this sequence pops up maybe in contexts where both the magnitude related to log n and the multiplicative structure of the prime factors are important. So the value is in knowing the links exist. Even if the reason isn't immediately clear, it prompts exploration. That's the beauty of the OEIS, really. It shows you the web. Okay, here's something I found really interesting. The comments mention this sequence does not satisfy Benford's law. Ah, yes. That's quite counterintuitive for some sequences. Can you remind us, what's the gist of Benford's law? Benford's law basically says that in many, many real-world data sets, think populations, accounting data, physical constants, the first digit isn't uniformly distributed. You mean like you don't get ones, twos, threes, etc. appearing equally often as the first digit? Not at all. You get way more ones, about 30% of the time, actually, than twos are less common, down to nines, which appear less than 5% of the time. It follows a specific logarithmic pattern. And the sequence, floor n, doesn't do that. Why not? It seems pretty fundamental. It seems like it should, maybe. But the paper cited by Wyman and others explains it. The core issue is how the sequence values are generated. The steps, the way it jumps at powers of e. Exactly. Benford's law tends to work for data spanning many orders of magnitude where the generation process is sort of logarithmically smooth, you might say, or random in a certain way. But the sequence isn't smooth like that. No. The values stay constant for long stretches. On a linear scale, increasingly long stretches. And then jump abruptly. The distribution of n values that give you a specific output, like 2 or 3, doesn't match the distribution needed for Benford's law across powers of 10. The structure imposed by floor long overrides the Benford distribution. Interesting. So the regularity of the function itself prevents it from following that statistical law. That's a good way to put it. The linked paper goes into the mathematical details if you really want to dig in. We'll definitely point people to that. Okay, shifting gears slightly. The OEIS entry provides code snippets. Maple, Mathematica, PRRI, Haskell. Ah, yes. Very useful. What's the value for, say, a number theory student seeing these implementations? Oh, immense value. It connects the abstract math floor long to something concrete you can actually run. See it work. Right. And you see the core functions, log and floor. It shows how directly the definition translates to code. It encourages experimentation. You can generate terms, test things, maybe use it in your own explorations. It makes the math tangible. Yeah, I can see that. And speaking of exploration, there's that conjecture listed from Joseph Shemia, August 2024. Hmm, the one with the slightly complex formula. 4, 3, N2. 3, N2, 1. That's the one. Checked up to N equals 106, it says. What does finding a conjecture like this tell us? It tells us math is alive. A conjecture is, well, it's an educated guess. It's a pattern someone observed that seems to hold true based on a lot of computation in this case. But not proven? Not proven rigorously, no. That's the key. The fact that this different looking formula matches floor log for a million terms is really striking. It suggests there might be some deeper connection, maybe some approximation to the logarithm we don't usually see. Or just a surprising coincidence that holds for a long time. That's always possible with conjectures. But one holding for so long usually hints at something real. It's a puzzle. It shows even for an easy sequence there can be unanswered questions, active research. Really puts it in perspective. Quickly, the entry also notes the offset is 1, 8, and N.J. Sloan is the author. The offset 1, that just means the first term is for N1, right? Correct. The list starts at a 1. The 8 might indicate maybe where the sequence starts exhibiting a certain behavior more clearly or just another index point of interest. Sometimes multiple offsets are given. And Sloan, of course, the founder. The founder and curator. His name is on countless entries, foundational ones especially. And finally, there's that list of related and adjacent sequences. A000193, A000194, A000196. Yes, that context is crucial in the OE
