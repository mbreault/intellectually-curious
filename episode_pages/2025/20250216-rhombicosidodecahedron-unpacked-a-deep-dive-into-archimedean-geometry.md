## Description

In this episode we unpack the rhombicosidodecahedron, an Archimedean solid with 62 faces (20 triangles, 30 squares, 12 pentagons), 120 edges, and 60 vertices. We'll trace its kinship to the icosahedron and dodecahedron, show how it can arise from expanding an icosidodecahedron or assembling five cubes, and explain its link to Johnson solids through cupola rotations. We also explore the golden ratio in physical models, and visual tools like orthogonal projections, spherical tilings, and stereographic projections that illuminate its structure.

## Transcript

Welcome back. For another deep dive in our mathematics series, we are tackling the Archimedean solids. Oh boy. And today we're going to be looking at one with quite a name. It's the rhombicosidodecahedron. And our source for this deep dive is going to be, as usual, the amazing Wikipedia. This is a good one. This is a fun one. Yeah, it looks pretty wild. So maybe just to get us started, can you help us break down that name? Because it sounds like someone took all the geometry terms and put them in a blender, and this is what came out. Rhombicosidodecahedron. It is a very descriptive name, though. And I think that's kind of cool once you know all the pieces. It is a combination of rhombus, icosahedron, and dodecahedron, which all hint at the shapes that are making up the faces of this solid. So we've got triangles from the icosahedron, we've got pentagons from the dodecahedron, and then where does that rhombus fit in? So that's where it gets really interesting. So the term rhombicosidodecahedron was actually coined by Johannes Kepler back in 1618. Wow. And in his work, Harmonicus Mundi, he actually used a longer phrase. He said, truncated icosidodecahedral rhombus. Goodness gracious. To describe a related shape, the rhombic triacontahedron. Okay. So it gets, yeah, the name itself is a mouthful, but it points to the way that these shapes are constructed and how they're related to one another. Okay, well that is quite a mouthful. But let's get down to the shape itself. How many faces and edges and vertices are we dealing with here? All right, so the rhombicosidodecahedron has 62 faces, 120 edges, and 60 vertices. So this is a big one. Yeah, it's quite a complex shape. Okay, and what types of faces are those 62? Can break those down? Yes, so we have 20 triangles, 30 squares, and 12 pentagons. So it's like he took all of its simpler tessens and just put it all together in one. Yeah. So it's got the same number of triangles as an icosahedron, the same number of pentagons as a dodecahedron, and wait a minute, 30 squares. 30 squares. Is there some other shape hiding in there too? So this is fascinating. If you take five cubes and you expand them in a very particular way, you can fit them together to form the framework of a rhombicosidodecahedron, and the squares from those cubes become those 30 squares. Oh, that's so cool. It's like you've got those five cubes kind of nestled inside providing the scaffolding for a complex shape. Exactly, yeah. Oh, I like that. And you mentioned expanding an icosidodecahedron as well. Maybe walk us through how that's connected. Yeah, so if you start with an icosidodecahedron, which is another Archimedean solid, you can expand it outward and fill in the gaps and create a rhombicosidodecahedron. Okay. And that's why they share the same number of triangles and pentagons. Right, right, right. Because those faces are coming from that icosidodecahedron. That's fascinating. I'm starting to see all these interconnections between these different shapes, how you can kind of morph one into another. Yeah, it's like a whole family. Through expansions and manipulations. Yeah. I have a question about actually building this in real life. Okay. You know, I've seen those zone tool construction kits, and I know they use these golden rectangles to create a rhombicosidodecahedron. And I was curious, what's the significance of the golden ratio here? Well, the golden ratio, represented by the Greek letter phi, is this mathematical concept that shows up in all sorts of surprising places, including art and geometry. So in the case of zoom tool models, the squares of the rhombicosidodecahedron are stretched into golden rectangles. And that just means the ratio of their long side to the short side is equal to phi. So it's a very visual representation of how mathematical principles can be embodied in a physical object. It's really neat how a concept like the golden ratio, which seems so abstract, can actually be woven into the structure of this shape. Speaking of connections, I noticed that our Wikipedia source mentioned that the rhombicosidodecahedron is related to 12 Johnson solids. Yes. Can you tell us a little bit about those? Yes. So Johnson solids are another family of polyhedra, and they were named after a mathematician, Norman Johnson. And there are 92 of them. And what's interesting about them is they're all made up of regular polygons, kind of like our friend the rhombicosidodecahedron, but they're not all uniform, meaning their vertices aren't all arranged in the same way. Okay, so how are they related then to our star of the show, the rhombicosidodecahedron? So think of the rhombicosidodecahedron as like a starting point. By removing or rotating certain groups of faces called cupolae, you can generate 12 different Johnson solids. So some of these involve rotating pentagonal cupolae in specific ways, leading to names like gyrate, parabijurate, metabijurate, and even trirurate rhombicosidodecahedron. That's a mouthful. Yeah. So it's like you're tweaking this already complex shape and creating even more complex shapes. It's like this chain reaction of geometry. Exactly. Exactly. Okay, so just to kind of recap what we've been talking about, we've been exploring the rhombicosidodecahedron, which is an Archimedean solid with a name that's quite a mouthful. Definitely. And we've talked about how it's made up of 62 faces. We've got 20 triangles, 30 squares, and 12 pentagons. Right, and those numbers, like they're not just random, right? They're actually connected to those other shapes, like the icosahedron and the dodecahedron. Exactly. And also we talked about how you can actually create this shape by expanding an icosidodecahedron or fitting together those five cubes in that special way. Exactly. And then, forget the golden ratio. Oh, right, the golden ratio. That was a mind bender. Yeah. I mean, who would have thought that this concept from ancient mathematics would show up in the structure of this shape? Yeah, it's kind of like this secret code, almost, that unlocks all these hidden relationships in geometry. And we even touched on those Johnson solids that are related to the rhombicosidodecahedron, right? Absolutely. Absolutely. And those names, I mean, gyrate, trijurate. A mouthful. They're just as complex as the shapes themselves. Yeah, they're fun to say, though, you know? I mean, who doesn't like to say trijurate? That's true. That's true. It's just amazing to me how one shape can kind of give birth to all these others, you know? It's like this geometric family tree, almost. Absolutely. Yeah, and those manipulations, I mean, we're talking about like twisting and turning and adding and subtracting, you know? Right. Those manipulations can reveal even more about the properties of the shape. Like those Cartesian coordinates that we talked about. Yeah. Which, you know, I have to admit, they looked pretty daunting at first. All those square roots and symbols. Yeah, yeah. But you explained how those actually give us information about the circumradius and how that relates to the golden ratio. Right. It's just fascinating how these seemingly complex, you know, expressions can pinpoint something so fundamental about the shape. Yeah. You know, I'm a visual person, so I'm always looking for ways to kind of see these things more concretely. Right. And I know we touched on those different projections. Yes. Maybe talk a little bit more about how those can help us visualize what's going on with this shape. So, I mean, for example, the orthogonal projections, right? Those are kind of like looking at the shape head on from different directions. Okay. So it's like you're taking a bunch of 2D snapshots almost. And each one reveals a different aspect of the shape's symmetry and complexity. Like having multiple blueprints almost, you know? Exactly. With this one design. Yeah. That's a good analogy. And then those spherical tilings. Now, those are a little harder for me to wrap my head around. Well, imagine if you, you know, shrink the rhombicosidodecahedron down really tiny and you place it in the center of a sphere. Right. And then you project its edges and vertices outward onto the surface of that sphere. Okay. So what you end up with is this really cool pattern of triangles and squares and pentagons. Right. All interconnected, covering the entire surface of the sphere. So you're essentially transforming this 3D shape into this 2D pattern, but on this curved surface. Exactly. That's really cool. Yeah. And what about the stereographic projections? Those sounded pretty interesting. Yeah. So stereographic projections are a really neat way to map points from a sphere onto a plane, right? Okay. So imagine you have a light source at one pole of the sphere and you're projecting all those points onto a plane that's touching the opposite pole. Okay. And what's cool about this is that this projection preserves angles. Okay. Meaning that the relationships between all those shapes on the sphere are maintained on the plane. So it's like you're
