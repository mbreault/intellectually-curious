## Transcript

Hey everyone and welcome to another deep dive. Today we're going to be looking at supply chains. Okay. But not just any supply chains. We're going to be looking at supply chains and how graph technology is changing things up. Right. I'm really excited about this one. I've been reading a lot about this and it seems like there's some really interesting stuff happening. Yeah. You know, it's funny because it's not something that you would normally think of as being like super interesting supply chains. Right. But when you start looking at how graph technology is being used to like really understand these complex systems, it's actually really fascinating. Yeah. So for our listeners out there, maybe just like a real quick, like what is graph technology? Sure. Like how would you explain that to someone who's never heard of it before? So basically imagine a map, right? You've got cities and you've got roads connecting those cities. Okay. In graph technology, you've got what are called nodes and edges. Okay. And so the cities would be the nodes and the roads would be the edges. And so in a supply chain, you could have suppliers as nodes. You could have factories as nodes, warehouses, all these different things. Okay. And then the edges represent the relationships between them. So like who supplies who or, you know, where things are being shipped to. Okay. So it's basically like a visual representation of all those different connections in a supply chain. Exactly. Okay. But I mean, haven't companies been like drawing these kinds of diagrams for years? Like what's so different about graph technology? Yeah. So, you know, people have been trying to visualize supply chains for a long time, but the problem is traditional methods like, you know, using spreadsheets or just like basic diagrams don't really work very well when you have a really complex supply chain. Okay. You know, you get like a million different lines and it becomes really hard to see what's going on. So it's like too much information overload. You can't really make sense of it. Right. And so graph technology uses these specialized databases that are specifically designed to store and analyze relationships. And so you can actually see patterns and connections that you wouldn't be able to see otherwise. So it's not just about pretty pictures. It's about actually like analyzing that data and understanding the relationships. Exactly. And the cool thing is that it's not just about like static analysis. You can actually run simulations and you can see how changes in one part of the supply chain are going to affect other parts. Okay. Now that sounds really powerful. So this isn't just like a theoretical thing. Are companies actually using this stuff in the real world? Oh yeah, absolutely. Okay. So like one example is Jaguar Land Rover. Okay. They were having problems with supplier delays and it was really impacting their production. Oh yeah, I can imagine that would be a nightmare in the car industry. Exactly. And so they implemented graph technology to map out their entire supply network. Okay. And they were able to use that to identify alternative suppliers and actually resequence their production. So basically they use graph technology to dodge a bullet. Yeah, exactly. That's amazing. But I bet it wasn't cheap to implement. Well, you know, it's an investment, but the payoff can be huge. Okay. Like for Jaguar Land Rover, they estimated that it helped them prevent delays for something like 400,000 vehicles. Wow. And they said that it added about 100 million pounds to their bottom line. Okay. So that's a pretty good return on investment. Yeah. Are there other companies out there that are using it in such a like impactful way? Yeah. So another really interesting example is Boston Scientific. Okay. They make medical devices. Oh, wow. High stakes. Yeah, exactly. And they use graph technology to track product quality. Okay. So they can trace defects back to the root cause. Okay. And even like predict potential problems before they happen. So it's all about like preventative measures. Exactly. Wow. Okay. So we've been talking about these graph databases, but like how are they actually different from like the tools that companies have been using for years, like ERPs and stuff like that? Right. So traditional supply chain tools like ERPs, they're really good at managing individual transactions. Like, you know, how much inventory do you have in a specific warehouse or like tracking the status of an order. Okay. But they're not so good at connecting the dots and seeing the big picture. So it's like you can see the trees, but you can't see the forest. Exactly. And so graph technology allows you to zoom out and see the entire landscape of your supply chain. And that's where you get those really valuable insights. Okay. So it's about getting that holistic view. Exactly. Okay. Well, this is all really interesting, but I'm wondering like how do you even begin to build one of these supply chain graphs? Right. Is it just like plug in some software and let it do its magic? I wish it were that easy. Okay. There's definitely a lot of work involved. You know, first of all, you got to get data from all your different systems. Okay. You know, you might have data in your procurement system, your manufacturing system, your logistics system, and you got to bring all that together. So it's like a big data integration project. Yeah. And then you got to clean it up, you know, make sure it's all consistent. And then you got to figure out how to model that data in a way that makes sense for your specific supply chain. You know, you got to define the nodes and the edges and the types of relationships that you want to analyze. So it's not just about the technology. It's about understanding your own supply chain. Exactly. Okay. So it sounds like it's a pretty significant undertaking. It definitely is. And I imagine there are some challenges involved. Oh, there definitely are. Well, let's talk about those challenges in the next part of our deep dive. So stay tuned, folks. Okay, deep divers, welcome back. So we've talked about how graph technology can be a really powerful tool for understanding supply chains. Yeah. But as with anything, I'm sure there's some challenges that come along with it. Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, it's not a magic bullet. Right. You know, it's a really powerful technology. Yeah. But it's not something that you can just like plug in and it'll solve all your problems. Right. So what are some of the biggest challenges that companies face when they're trying to implement graph technology? Well, one of the first things is scalability. You know, supply chains can be incredibly complex. You might have thousands of suppliers, millions of products and all these different relationships between them. And so as that graph grows, it can become really challenging to manage. So it's like a data overload problem. Yeah, exactly. And so early graph databases, they really struggled to keep up with that kind of complexity. Okay. But luckily, there have been a lot of advances in graph database technology. Okay. And now we have these things called distributed graph databases. Okay. And basically what that means is that you can spread the workload across multiple machines. So it's like having a team of computers working together. Exactly. And so that allows you to handle those really complex queries and simulations. Okay. So scalability sounds like it's not really a problem anymore. Well, it's still something that you need to think about. Okay. But there are solutions out there. Okay. So what other challenges are there? Well, implementation can be a challenge. Okay. You know, it's not just about buying some software. You need to think about how you're going to get data from all your different systems and how you're going to clean that data. Right. And then how you're going to model it in the graph database. So it's like a whole data integration and data modeling project. Yeah. And then there's also the learning curve. Okay. You know, graph databases, they often use specialized query languages. Okay. And concepts that can be quite different from traditional SQL or spreadsheets. So you need to have people on your team who actually know how to use this stuff. Yeah, exactly. And you also need to think about change management. Okay. You know, anytime you implement a new technology, there's going to be some resistance from people who are used to doing things the old way. Right. So it's about getting buy-in from everyone who's going to be affected by this change. Exactly. Okay. So those are some of the challenges. But what about the benefits? Right. Like what are some of the things that companies are seeing when they successfully implement graph technology? Well, one of the biggest benefits is improved visibility. You know, imagine being able to see your entire supply chain in real time. Wow. You know, you can see where all your products are. Right. You can see where your suppliers are. Right. You can see potential bottlenecks. Okay. And you can even see the ripple effects of disruptions. So like if there's a port strike somewhere, you can immediately see how that's going to affect your supply chain. Exactly. And so that allows you to be much more proactive. Okay. You can start looking for alternative suppliers or alternative routes. So you're not just reacting to problems after they happen. You're actually trying to prevent them. Exactly. That's amazing. What other benefits are there? Well, another big one is risk mitigation. Okay. So graph technology can help you identify hidden risks in your supply chain. Okay. Like what kind of hidden risks? Well, let's say you source a critical component from multiple suppliers. Okay. You might think you're diversified. Right. But what if all of those suppliers rely on the same subsupplier for a key raw material? Oh, I see. So it's like a single point of failure. Yeah. Exactly. And so graph technology can help you see those connections. Okay. And that allows you to take steps to mitigate that risk. So you can find
