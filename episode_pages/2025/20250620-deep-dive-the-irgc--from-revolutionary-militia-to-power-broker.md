## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. We're here to unpack complex topics, give you the essential knowledge, and hopefully some surprising insights along the way. That's the goal. And today we are really plunging into something significant. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. You hear it called the IRGC or sometimes SIPA or PASDARAN. Yeah, and it's huge. Not just another military unit. It's arguably one of Iran's most powerful organizations. Its influence, it touches pretty much everything. Domestic stuff, foreign policy, the economy. Right, so our mission today for this Deep Dive is to kind of trace how the IRGC got here. It started back in 1979, basically as a street force during the revolution. Exactly. Humble beginnings, you could say. And we want to look at how it became this multifaceted entity it is now. Military power, sure, but also political, economic, and this deep ideological core. And how those core beliefs really drive what they do. Precisely. We want to give you that full picture. Okay, so let's start at the beginning. Post-revolution Iran, 1979. What did that actually look like on the ground? Must have been chaotic. Oh, absolutely chaotic. Fragmented is a good word. You had the fall of the Shah and then this power vacuum. And into that stepped these local groups, these KOMITAS, Islamic Revolutionary Committees. Right, the committees. Yeah, and lots of armed volunteers too, often working out of mosques. And they basically just appointed themselves, you know, vigilantes in a way. They were running secret trials, carrying out executions. I mean, there's a quote describing them as being like the Justice Ministry, the Law Court, the Police and Gendarmerie all rolled into one. Power was really decentralized, almost neighborhood by neighborhood. So a kind of controlled chaos, or maybe uncontrolled. How did the actual provisional government try and deal with that? They must have tried to get a handle on it. They definitely tried. It was a struggle though. There were plans floated, you know, to purge some of the committees that were maybe going too far. Try to merge the militiamen into some kind of national police force. Standard procedure, try to centralize. Right, restore some kind of normal state function. But it wasn't that simple. And this is where the IRGC itself really starts to form, isn't it? Ayatollah Khomeini makes a key move. An absolutely critical move. April 1979. You have these high-profile assassinations happening. The chaos was ongoing and Khomeini steps in. He orders the establishment of the IRGC. But crucially, as a special armed force. Special how? Special in that it answered only to the Revolutionary Council, which was dominated by the clerics, not to the provisional government. It was loyal directly to the Islamic fundamentalists driving the revolution. Ah, okay. So right from the start, it's separate. A different kind of military force. Exactly. Independent from the regular army, the Artesh, and the police. Set apart. And what's fascinating is how they saw themselves even that early on. They used phrases like, popular and revolutionary individuals having Islamic magnanimity. Yeah, and this sort of dual nature. Merciful among themselves, but harsh toward the infidels. That self-perception really set the tone, didn't it? Protectors of the revolution, but also its enforcers. Absolutely. And it grew incredibly fast, right? The initial numbers were pretty small. Yeah, the expectation was maybe 6,000 members initially. But by June 1980, so just over a year later, it was already around 30,000. So it became clear very quickly this wasn't just some temporary militia. It was being built as a serious counterweight to the traditional military and as the guardian of this new Islamic system. And that rapid growth, that wasn't just random recruitment. It ties into Khomeini's vision for it, right? This idea of an ideological army. What did he actually mean by that? Yeah, that concept is central. It wasn't about building just another army focused on tactics and hardware in the traditional sense. It was about creating a force driven, first and foremost, by religious faith and absolute loyalty to the revolution's ideals. So motivation matters more than anything else. Pretty much. Discipline, competence, yes, but rooted in Islamic equity. And Khomeini explicitly rejected self-interest or money as reasons for joining. The idea was commitment stemming from, well, a deep spiritual conviction. That sounds incredibly powerful, but also maybe hard to maintain as you get bigger. How did they actually screen people? Who were they looking for? The selection was apparently very rigorous. They were looking for that deep commitment. You needed, and this is specific wording, faith in the Islamic creed and the unified world Islamic nation. Okay. And also, significantly, a love of jihad and martyrdom. You had to believe in God, the supreme leader, the idea of divine victory, resurrection, and that Islam's warriors were righteous. So it's not just signing up for military service. It's a calling, almost. Very much so. Spiritual conviction was paramount, maybe even more than pure military skill, especially early on. Okay, so you have this ideologically driven force. How did that translate into how they actually planned to operate militarily? Well, it led to a pretty distinct military doctrine guided by five main principles. Think of it as fusing spiritual duty with tactics. Okay, what were they? First was the mobilization of the public, the basij al-mumi, getting the whole society involved and supportive. Second, fostering really strong personal bonds and trust between commanders and the ranks. They called it military command, not just hierarchy, but connection. Makes sense for a revolutionary force. Third, constant military preparedness, always assuming threats. Fourth, ensuring any retaliation strictly followed Islamic laws, a kind of religiously sanctioned approach to warfare. And fifth, prioritizing surprise through secrecy and constant surveillance. And Khomeini's own words about this are pretty powerful, aren't they? That the IRGC is equipped with divine power, that their weapon is Allahu Akbar, which no power in the world can counter. Absolutely. That's not just rhetoric. It's a core belief. It underscores their conviction that their mission is divinely ordained. Which brings us to the role of the supreme leader. First Khomeini, now Khamenei. He's central to this whole structure. Absolutely central. Under the concept of Velayat-e-Faqih, the guardianship of the Islamic jurist, the supreme leader isn't just a political figure. He's seen as embodying the revolution itself. So the IRGC's loyalty isn't just personal loyalty to the man. No, it's ideological. It's loyalty to the position and what it represents. The continuation and protection of the Islamic revolution and its principles. And Khomeini's view of the world definitely shaped this. He saw the international system as this constant struggle, right? Good versus evil. Yeah, a perpetual conflict. Good being Shia Islam, specifically the Islamic Republic of Iran, and evil being, well, mainly the West, and especially the United States, the great Satan. And that belief wasn't just talk. It directly led to Iran actively supporting other Islamic groups and liberation movements around the world. Exactly. It became part of their foreign policy doctrine, this conviction that real peace with aggressors, particularly the U.S., was basically impossible. You had to resist. And this ties into that unconventional idea of victory you mentioned earlier. It wasn't just about winning battles. Right. For Khomeini, victory wasn't necessarily defined by battlefield success in the way, say, a Western military might see it. Victory was achieved by fulfilling your religious duty. Which duty was? To fight God's enemies. Regardless of the outcome on the ground, regardless of the cost, if you fulfilled that duty, you had achieved a kind of victory. It fundamentally changes how you approach conflict. That is a really different mindset. It helps explain their resilience, maybe, in things like the long Iran-Iraq War. Definitely. And thinking about military power, after that war, Khomeini actually approved seeking some pretty advanced capabilities. Including nuclear weapons? Yes. He specifically approved efforts to acquire nuclear weapons alongside other advanced arms. The goal was explicitly stated, boost military power and enable offensive operations. This wasn't just a vague wish list, was it? No, not at all. He talked about needing hundreds of infantry brigades, thousands of tanks, artillery pieces, missiles, and specifically mentioned the desire for laser and atomic weapons. Wow. That's a huge ambition, a real strategic shift towards projecting power, not just defense. A massive shift. It really set the course for Iran's long-term military development, much of which falls under the IRGC's umbrella. And this drive, this willingness to fight regardless of cost, it seems connected to the martyrdom culture within the IRGC. That's a major element, isn't it? It's profound, yeah. Deeply rooted in Shia history, particularly the martyrdom of Imam Hussein. And it's not just a historical memory, it's actively promoted. How so? Through initiatives like the culture of self-sacrifice, which puts out magazines, books, really embedding this ideal. And it has tangible effects. Like the human demining. Exactly. That's probably the most extreme example. Basij members, believing that dying as a martyr guarantees immediate entry to heaven, were used to clear minefields with their bodies during the Iran-Iraq War. Well, it fosters an incredible level of commitment, even to the point of self-sacrifice being seen as a positive outcome. It's hard to comprehend from an outside perspective, but clearly vital to understanding their mindset. Okay, so this ideological army, how has it actually structured itself over the years to pursue these goals? It's evolved significantly. Today the IRGC isn't just one monolithic block. It's broadly organized
