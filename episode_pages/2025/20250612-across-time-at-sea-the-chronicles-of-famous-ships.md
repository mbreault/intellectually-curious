## Transcript

Welcome to the deep dive. We've got quite a collection of sources here today, articles, research, historical bits and pieces, and we're going to dive right in and pull out the really fascinating stuff for you. Yeah, looking forward to this one. Today, we're kind of setting sail across time, exploring the amazing world of ships. This deep dive is all about the chronicles of famous ships. Because, you know, these vessels, they aren't just wood and sails. They're like time capsules, right? Carry all these stories, trade, conflict, human cleverness across, well, centuries. Our sources take us from the Bronze Age right up to Tudor warships and those massive ships that basically built empires. And that's the key thing, isn't it? Looking at these specific ships, the Uluburun, the Mary Rose, these East Indiamen, lets you see the bigger picture. You start to understand these, like, huge, ancient trade networks, how naval tech changed so dramatically, the whole business side of empire building. Exactly. So our mission today is really to unpack the most compelling bits from these sources, see what connections pop up across all these different times in seafaring history. Okay, let's get into it. Right, let's start really far back, like 3,300 years ago. Picture the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of modern Turkey. There's this ship loaded down with goods, and it sinks. Flash forward thousands of years, archaeologists find it, the Uluburun shipwreck. And the sources are clear, this wasn't just any wreck. It's like one of the biggest, richest Bronze Age discoveries ever. So the question is, what was this ship doing there with all that incredible stuff on board? It's just amazing what they found. The Uluburun, it was basically a floating snapshot of late Bronze Age international trade. The cargo list they pieced together from the sources, it's mind-blowing. Like what? Okay, so hundreds of copper ingots shaped like oxides, probably from Cyprus. Put those together, you get bronze, right? Pretty essential metal. Right, the Bronze Age makes sense. But way more than that, ebony wood, elephant ivory, amber beads, even raw glass ingots, some were this incredible cobalt blue color. And chemical tests actually link that glass to stuff found in Egypt and even Mycenae over in Greece. And murex shells, you know, the ones they used for that super valuable purple dye. So this ship wasn't just some local trader hopping along the coast. This diverse cargo points to this vast, really sophisticated trade network. It connected Egypt, the Near East, Cyprus, the Aegean. It was a globalized economy, even back then. Getting all that stuff out must have been a huge job. The sources talk about the depth, right? Between 42 and 61 meters. Yeah, deep. Which meant dive times were super short, like 20 minutes max on the bottom per dive. It took them 11 seasons, over 22,000 dives to recover everything. Just incredible dedication. And the ship itself, how was it built? I read it was cedar of Lebanon. That's right, prime shipbuilding timber back then. And they used a technique called shell-based construction. So they built the outer shell of the hull first. The key thing was the joinery pegged mortise and tenon joints. Okay, what does that mean exactly? Well, instead of just fitting planks together, they carved a slot, the mortise in one plank, and a tongue, the tenon on the edge of the next. They fit them together, then drilled a hole through both and hammered in a wooden peg to lock it tight. Our sources say this Uluburun wreck is the earliest known archaeological example of this technique on a proper seagoing ship from that part of the world, the Levant. It gave the hull amazing strength without needing lots of internal frames like later ships. The tenons themselves kind of acted like mini braces, also had a sort of early keel, a proto-keel. And that construction could handle 17 tons of cargo. Apparently so. It was a really advanced design for its time, using the materials and knowledge they had. Clever stuff. And what about the people? The sources mention finding different sets of weights. Yeah, that's fascinating. Finding at least four distinct sets suggests it wasn't just one owner's cargo. You probably had multiple merchants traveling together, each with their own goods and measuring tools. One particular set of weights, shaped like animals, and a Canaanite-style sword found nearby, might point to a chief merchant, maybe even the captain. But it wasn't just merchants, was it? There was Mycenaean stuff too. Exactly, a significant amount, actually. Fine pottery, weapons like swords and daggers, razors, even beautiful glass beads matching styles from Mycenaean Greece. This strongly suggests Mycenaean people were on board. Maybe emissaries, messengers, escorting some of the cargo. So not just simple trade then? Probably not just private trade, no. It hints that this voyage might have been tied into high-level exchanges between rulers, like official gift shipments alongside the commercial stuff. So you've got rulers' goods, diplomats, and private merchants all on one ship. It's a really complex picture of how connected that world was. It really makes you think, doesn't it? Okay, let's jump forward a bit, still in antiquity. Another amazing ship mentioned in the sources, the Greek ship Syracusia. Totally different purpose from the Uluburun. Yeah, this one wasn't primarily about bulk cargo. No, it was designed as this floating palace, a luxury passenger ship, but also heavily armed. The sources say it was about 55 meters long, 1,800 tons capacity, huge for that time. Colossal, yeah. Yeah. Really pushing Hellenistic engineering. And the name linked to its design is legendary. Archimedes. Ah, the famous Archimedes. The very same. It's this great story in the sources, you know. King Hieronymus II of Syracuse gets Archimedes involved in the design and launch. Then, to prove his principle of lever, give me a place to stand and I shall move the earth. Archimedes supposedly uses some kind of machine, maybe involving pulleys and levers, to single-handedly drag the fully loaded Syracusia along the harbor. Just to show off, basically. Well, to demonstrate the power of mechanics. A brilliant piece of public science demonstration, you could say. It definitely inspired people to think bigger about shipbuilding. It's fascinating seeing these two side by side, isn't it? The Uluburun wreck, this incredibly detailed look at Bronze Age global trade, thanks to its cargo. And then the Syracusia, showing off Hellenistic engineering skill, luxury scale, and Archimedes' genius. Two very different ancient marvels. Absolutely. Different times, different priorities, but both pushing the boundaries of what was possible at sea. Okay, big leap now. Fast forward thousands of years. We're heading to Tudor England in a ship built purely for war, the Mary Rose. Ah, yes. Henry VIII's pride and joy. Launched in 1511, a carrack, those big, high-sided sailing ships, she served for 34 years. And she wasn't static. The Mary Rose went through a massive rebuild in 1536, got bigger from about 500 tons, maybe up to 700 or 800, and crucially, they added another whole tier of gun ports lower down the hull. So she could carry more cannons. Exactly. This made her one of the very first ships designed to fire a heavy broadside. You know, lots of cannons firing together from one side. Naval tactics were still evolving. They weren't doing the line of battle thing yet, but it was a huge step towards using gunpowder effectively at sea. You see that classic Tudor warship look. High castles, fore and aft, and those new gun ports. What's so incredible about the Mary Rose, though, is what they found inside her when they raised her. It gives us this unbelievable window into Tudor life at sea. It really does. The preservation was amazing because she sank quickly in mud. The sources list things like chests full of carpentry tools, personal items like rosaries showing the crew's religious life, and that barber surgeon's cabin. Wow, a whole chest of medical kits, syringes, probes, even a feeding bottle. You can almost picture them working. It brings the people right back to life, doesn't it? And some finds were genuinely groundbreaking. The sources point out this complete set of navigation instruments, compasses, dividers, a log reel for speed, protractors. It's the earliest dated set found in Europe. And that's significant because they actually date from before the earliest written descriptions we have for the widespread use of some of those tools. It suggests sailors were using this tech earlier than historians previously thought. Practical use outpacing the textbooks, maybe. And you can't forget Hatch, the ship's dog. They found the skeleton, probably a terrier mix, near the surgeon's cabin, likely the rat catcher. Little details like that just make it so real. She wasn't just sitting in port, though. She saw action, right? Oh, yeah. She was off in the flagship, fought against the French several times during Henry VIII's wars. The sources mention her being there at the Battle of Brest in 1513, a really dramatic moment where the English admiral, Sir Edward Howard, died trying to board a French ship. But her own end was dramatic, too, sinking in 1545 right in front of everyone. Right, during the Battle of the Solent, off Spithead near Portsmouth, she just capsized and sank incredibly quickly. But why she sank is still debated. It's one of history's
