## Description

A deep dive into how astronomers detect planets around other stars by watching tiny wobbles in starlight. We explain the Doppler shift, radial velocity measurements, and the quest from the first hot Jupiter 51 Pegasi b to the centimeter-per-second precision of HARPS. We'll cover the M sin I mass ambiguity, the challenge of stellar noise, and how combining radial velocity with transits unlocks true planet masses. Finally, we glimpse the future with Espresso and Codex and the race toward true Earth analogs in the habitable zone.

## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive. Today we're looking way out into the cosmos. We're talking about how we actually find planets orbiting other stars. Our mission is to get into one of the most ingenious methods. Radial velocity. We'll look at how it works, the big discoveries, and, you know, where it's headed. And joining us is a Nobel laureate, an expert in this really fascinating field. Welcome. Glad to be here. It's certainly a captivating area of astronomy. So radial velocity. The basic idea sounds, well, almost simple. A star doing a little wobble. That's essentially it, yes. But the key is why it wobbles. You see, a star and its planet don't just have the planet going around a fixed star. Instead, they both orbit their common center of mass. Now, because the star is vastly more massive, its orbit is tiny. Just a subtle wobble. Almost imperceptible, really. Okay, a tiny wobble from light years away. How on earth do we pick that up? Ah, well, that's where the clever part comes in. We use the Doppler effect. You know, like how an ambulance siren changes pitch. As it passes you, right. Higher coming towards, lower going away. Exactly. Same principle with light. As the star wobbles slightly towards us, its light waves get squished a bit. We say they're blue shifted. And when it wobbles away from us, the light waves stretch out. They become red shifted. So we're measuring these tiny shifts in color back and forth. Precisely. We're measuring the change of the star's velocity along our line of sight, its radial velocity. That really is ingenious. And this technique, it basically kicked off the modern hunt for exoplanets, didn't it? With a famous discovery back in 95. It absolutely did, 1995. The discovery of 51 Pegasi b. That was the moment. It wasn't just the first planet found around a sun-like star, but it was a complete shock. A gas giant bigger than Jupiter orbiting its star in just four days. Extremely close. Extremely hot. A four day orbit. That must have thrown a wrench in the works for planetary formation theories. Oh, completely. We call them hot Jupiters. It forced us to think seriously about things like planetary migration planets forming further out and spiraling inwards. It really rewrote the rule book. Incredible. So after finding these massive close-in planets, how did the technology evolve to find smaller ones? Ones more like Earth? Well, that was the challenge. Pushing for precision. Early on, it was tough. We needed incredibly stable instruments. One technique involved using things like hydrogen fluoride gas cells. Basically, you pass the starlight through this gas, which imprints very precise, known absorption lines onto the spectrum. Like a ruler for the light waves. Exactly. A very stable reference. That helped us measure tiny shifts much more accurately. We got down to maybe 15 meters per second precision initially. 15 meters per second sounds fast, but I guess for a star's wobble, that's still pretty subtle. What came next? Key instruments pushed things forward. Eladye, the spectrograph that actually found 51 Pegasi b, got down to about 13 meters. But the real game changer was HARPS. The High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher came online in 2003. HARPS achieved an amazing long-term precision, closer to 50 centimeters per second. Not meters, centimeters. Wow, centimeters per second. That's incredibly sensitive. That must have opened up whole new categories of planets. It absolutely did. That level of precision allowed us to detect Neptune-mass planets and even what we call super-Earths planets. Just a few times the mass of Earth. Radial velocity became hugely productive. It found those hot Jupiters, yes, but also complex systems like Upsilon Andromedae, the first system found with three planets. And it revealed this amazing diversity of smaller worlds, too, like GJ 581e, which for a while held the record for the lowest mass planet found, about 1.9 Earth masses. It showed us that smaller planets might actually be, well, pretty common. So it's been incredibly successful, but are there limitations? Things it can't quite tell us? Yes, definitely. The main one is what we call the M sin I problem. Remember, we're only seeing the star's motion towards or away from us. We don't usually know the angle of the planet's orbit, its inclination I. So we can only calculate the planet's minimum mass. Its true mass could be higher if the orbit is tilted. Ah, I see. So it gives us a floor, but not necessarily the exact number. Right. Though statistically, it works well for studying populations of planets. And sometimes, if the planet also transits its star, we can combine methods to get the true mass. Another big challenge is just the star itself. Stars aren't perfectly still beacons. They have star spots, magnetic activity, surface convection, things we call stellar noise. Jitteriness from the star itself. Exactly. And that stellar jitter can sometimes look a lot like the wobble caused by a small planet. It makes finding tiny planets, especially Earth-sized ones, very tricky. It's like trying to hear a whisper in a noisy room. So filtering out that noise and pushing precision even further, that's the future, finding true Earth analogs. That's the goal. We're building even more advanced instruments. Espresso on the Very Large Telescope is aiming for 10 centimeters per second precision. And looking further ahead, instruments like Codex, planned for the extremely large telescope, hope to reach maybe 1 centimeter per second. Incredible. 1 centimeter per second, that's barely moving. It's unbelievably precise. But that's the kind of stability you need to reliably detect an Earth-mass planet in the habitable zone of a sun-like star, a zone where liquid water could exist. It's amazing. From just noticing a tiny stellar wobble, we've mapped out thousands of worlds and completely changed our view of the cosmos. It's been a remarkable journey, transforming exoplanets from theory into, well, an entire field of study. This deep dive really highlights how radial velocity hasn't just expanded our cosmic map, but forced us to rethink how planets form and evolve. And now we're getting so close to finding potentially habitable Earth-like worlds. It puts our own little planet in such a fascinating context, doesn't it? Just think what other kinds of planetary systems are out there waiting for us to detect their star's subtle dance.
