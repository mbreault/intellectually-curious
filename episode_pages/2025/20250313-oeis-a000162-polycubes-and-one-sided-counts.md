## Transcript

Welcome back everyone to our ongoing deep dive into the OEIS, you know that amazing online encyclopedia of integer sequences. If you're new here, just picture a giant digital library. But instead of books, it's packed with number patterns. That's the OEIS in a nutshell. And we've been exploring it through the lens of number theory. Today we're going three-dimensional with sequence I-000162. This one delves into counting something called polycubes. And you know what? If you've ever played with building blocks or tried to cram oddly shaped luggage into your car, well you've already dabbled in the world of polycubes, maybe without even realizing it. To help us unpack all this, we have a Fields Medal winning mathematician with us today. They're known for making even the most mind-bending math feel surprisingly down to earth. It's great to be here. Alright, so this sequence, I-000162, it starts off pretty simple, 1, 1, 2, 8, 2, 9. But then things escalate quickly. What's the story these numbers are telling us about building with cubes? Well, those numbers represent how many unique polycubes you can make using that specific number of cubes. So the first one, that's just a single cube by itself. Then the next one, that's two cubes stuck together. Not a lot of variety there, right? Right. But when you hit two, meaning we're using three cubes, now you start to get some choices. You could have a straight line of three or an L shape. Okay, I see that. But then that jump to eight when we get to four cubes, I mean I get that more cubes means more options. But are there really eight distinct ways to arrange just four cubes? Oh, there are definitely eight. And this is where visualizing things starts to get a bit tricky. You might initially think of just the simple arrangements, right? Like a straight line of four or a square shape. But when you start rotating those and considering mirror images, the possibilities really multiply. Ah, like a left hand and a right hand. They're both hands, but one's a reflection of the other. Exactly. That's what's called chirality, isn't it? Yeah. And that matters when we're counting these polycubes. Absolutely. Chirality plays a big role. A chiral polycube is just like your hands. They're mirror images, but you can't just rotate one to perfectly match the other. Okay, so it's not just about the shape itself. Yeah. But also its orientation in space. Exactly. And in this particular OEIS sequence, reflections are counted as different polycubes. That's how we get to eight for those four cube arrangements, which are technically called tetrachubes. Tetrachubes. I like that. You know, I was reading that there's actually two ways to count these things. One where reflections are unique, like we're doing here, and another called the free count, where they're treated as the same. That's right. There are different conventions depending on the specific context. So our sequence, A000162, this one gives us what's called the one-sided count, which results in those eight tetrachubes. But if we were using the free count, we'd only have seven tetrachubes, because two of them are just mirror images of each other. And get this, Wikipedia mentions that the classic Soma cube puzzle uses both forms of those mirror image tetrachubes. I always love finding those real-world tie-ins. It's fascinating how these concepts show up in unexpected places. It really is. But let's get back to those numbers in the sequence. We go from 166 hexacubes, that's for six cubes, to a whopping 123 heptacubes for seven. It's like the number of possibilities just explodes as we add more cubes. Is there a name for this rapid increase? It's called combinatorial explosion. Combinatorial explosion. And it's a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science. As you add more components to any system, the number of possible arrangements skyrockets. Like if you're cooking, think about having a handful of ingredients versus a whole pantry full. Your recipe options go through the roof with that pantry. So polycubes aren't just child's play then. They're actually demonstrating this fundamental mathematical principle. Exactly. They're a tangible way to visualize combinatorial explosion. Wikipedia mentions they're connected to even more math concepts. Things like tilings and lattices. Oh, absolutely. Polycubes have deep connections to those areas. What's the link there? Well, tilings explore how shapes fit together perfectly to cover a surface. You know, no gaps or overlaps. Imagine tiling your bathroom floor. But now think about doing that in three dimensions. Polycubes can be the building blocks for certain 3D tiling. Okay, I'm starting to see how this goes beyond just blocks. Then there's lattices, those regular grids of points in space. How do those relate? Think of a lattice as a framework. And certain types of lattices can be analyzed using, you guessed it, polycubes. Their structure can be represented and understood using polycube arrangements. All right, and this is where my brain starts to melt a bit. Wikipedia also mentioned something about a tesseract, a four-dimensional hypercube unfolding into a specific octa-cube. It's called the Dali cross. This sounds like something straight out of science fiction. It does sound a bit like that, but it's a fascinating concept. Are we really about to talk about four dimensions through the lens of building blocks? It's more connected than you might think. It's like if you unfolded a cardboard box to lay flat, you're taking a 3D object and representing it in 2D. Unfolding a 4D hypercube into our 3D world can similarly result in a polycube shape, and the Dali cross is one example of that. Hold on, I need a second to picture that. So we're essentially unfolding a shape that exists in a dimension we can't even see, and it ends up looking like something we can build with blocks. Exactly, that's the fascinating part. And what's even more intriguing is that Salvador Dali, the surrealist artist, he actually featured this octa-cube, the Dali cross, in his 1954 painting, Crucifixion, Corpus Hypercubus. No way, he was clearly intrigued by these higher-dimensional ideas. It seems so. That connection to Dali is blowing my mind. We've gone from building blocks to four-dimensional art in the span of a few minutes. It's quite a journey, isn't it? It really is, and Wikipedia mentions a couple more intriguing properties of polycubes. Boundary connectivity and dual graphs. Ah yes, those are key concepts. Yeah, I was wondering about those. Boundary connectivity sounds like it deals with, well, the boundaries of these shapes. It gets into how the surfaces of polycubes connect. Some can have holes or disconnected boundaries, which adds another layer of complexity. And a dual graph, that's a way to visualize a polycube's structure. You use a network of points and lines. Each point represents a cube, and the lines show which cubes are connected. So we have all this geometry going on, but we're talking about this on a podcast about the OEIS, which is all about number theory. How do we bridge that gap? That's where the true power of the OEIS comes in. It allows us to connect seemingly disparate areas of mathematics. We can use number sequences and other tools of number theory to study these geometric properties. For example, we can look at sequences related to the number of polycubes with a specific surface area, or the number of ways to arrange them in a tiling pattern. These sequences then give us numerical insights into the geometric characteristics of polycubes. So it's like we're finding numerical codes embedded within these 3D shapes. By cracking those codes, we can unlock a deeper understanding of their geometry. Precisely. And that's just the beginning. And what's particularly fascinating is how we can move beyond simply visualizing these polycubes, you know, and actually translate their geometric properties into the language of numbers. So instead of just seeing shapes, we can actually describe them using numbers. Exactly. And by doing so, we can analyze them using the powerful tools of number theory. Think of it like this. We're uncovering hidden numerical codes within these 3D shapes. That's a really cool way to think about it. But for those of us who might be new to number theory, what are some of the key concepts we need to understand to crack those codes? Well, one fundamental concept is that of counting. We've already touched upon this with the OEIS sequence, A000162, right? Which tells us how many polycubes exist for each number of cubes. To truly understand this sequence, we need to delve into combinatorics, which is all about counting and arranging objects. So combinatorics helps us understand how many different ways we can put those cubes together. Precisely. And remember our earlier discussion about chirality. Symmetry also plays a crucial role here. When we analyze the symmetries of a polycube, we're essentially looking for patterns and transformations that leave the shape unchanged. And those symmetries can be described using mathematical groups, which are algebraic structures that have deep connections to number theory. Okay, my brain is starting to make some connections here. We've got geometry, combinatorics, and now algebra all intertwined in the world of polycubes. It's amazing how these different areas of math start to blend together. And that's just the beginning. Polycubes also have connections to graph theory, where we can represent their structure using networks of nodes and edges. Each node in the graph represents a cube in the polycube, and the edges represent the connections between them. So we can actually draw a diagram that shows how the cubes in a polycube are linked together. Exactly. These diagrams are called dual
