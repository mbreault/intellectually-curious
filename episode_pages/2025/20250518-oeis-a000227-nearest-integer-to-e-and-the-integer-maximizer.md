## Description

Explore A000227, the sequence of integers closest to e, which begins 1, 3, 7, 20, 55, 148 and is indexed from 0. We trace the surprising link to a related discrete maximization problem for the function 6^{k!}, the observation by Stanislav Sikora that the integer argmax aligns with the rounded continuous peak, and the high-precision A000227Test that finds no counterexamples up to n > 24,500. We discuss the heuristic (not a proof) based on peak symmetry, and place this curious coincidence in historical context with notes on indexing and connections to related sequences.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our deep dive series. Today we're continuing our journey through the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS. Yes, that incredible resource for anyone interested in number patterns and their connections. Exactly. And our focus today is sequence A000227. Now, on the surface, it sounds simple enough. It's the nearest integer to $e$, you know, the base of the natural logarithm. Right, the $e$ raised to the power. It immediately bridges the continuous world, that smooth exponential curve, with the discrete world of integers. It does. And that's often where things get interesting. So if you calculate 1 for 1, every 1, 2 dollars and so on, and round to the nearest whole number, what do you get? Well, the sequence starts 1, then 3, 7, 20, 55, 148. And just a quick note on indexing, which the OEIS is very careful about. None starts at 0 here. So A0 is 1, which is round T dollars. A1 is 3, round A1. A2 is 7, round A2 and so forth. Those details matter. OK, so far so good. But when you dig into the comments section for A000227 on the OEIS site, you find this really intriguing observation from Stanislav Sikora. Ah, yes, the connection to another function. Exactly. He points out that the value $6^{k!}$ ever exceeds $e$ dollars is precisely where the function raised to the power of $1$ by Keller. Well, it's where that function reaches its maximum. It's a slightly unusual looking function, $6^{k!}$. It relates 6 to its roots in a way that depends on $k!$. And finding its peak lands you right on $n$. But that's Sikora's different question. He defines another sequence, let's call it $10$. This $10$ is the integer, the natural number, that makes that same function by a value as large as possible. So what we're jumping from the smooth, continuous function where the max is at $n$ to asking if we can only plug in whole numbers, tellery, which one gives the biggest result? Yeah, exactly. You're looking for the peak, but you can only stand on the integer steps. And this is a classic kind of question. Does the integer closest to the continuous maximum actually give you the maximum value when you restrict yourself to integers? And what's really amazing here is the observation. Empirically, it looks like the integer dollars that maximizes the discrete function is identical to our original sequence, the nearest integer to $e$. Identical, for how far? Well, according to the notes, this match holds for a very long way, at least up to $n$ greater than 24,500. Wow. That's quite a strong correlation. It suggests the peak of the discrete function consistently falls exactly at the integer closest to the continuous peak in Sela's. That kind of perfect alignment isn't something you'd necessarily expect by default. No, it really isn't. And this observation actually motivated the creation of a specific test program called A000227Test. The OEIS entry links to details about it. Okay, so what was the program trying to do? Find a counterexample. Precisely. It was built to hunt for any value of $n$ where the nearest integer to $i$ might differ from $6n$, the integer that maximizes $k1k1$. And how does it test for that difference? What's the logic? It's pretty straightforward, actually. It takes $a_k$ to be the nearest integer to $n$, so $k$ will be $a_n$. Then it calculates the function's value there, $val$ equals $k1k1$. And it compares that value $val$ to the values you get at the integers right next door, $k$ plus the dollars and $k$ on dollars. Ah, I see. So if the function's value was actually higher at $k$ plus $dam$ or $k$ yum ban, then the integer $k$ and wouldn't be the one that maximizes the function among integers. We'd have found a mismatch. Exactly. It's checking if the peak for the integers has shifted slightly away from the rounded value of $1$. Makes sense. And the results of this test? Well, they ran it using extremely high precision. The notes mentioned 30,000 digits, all the way up to $1$ and $24,500$. No mismatches found, none at all. So the empirical evidence is very strong. It really does look like $a_n$ is in the same elys as far as we've been able to check. For number theory folks, this kind of unexpected consistency is really intriguing. Definitely. And the documentation for the test program even offers a kind of, well, a heuristic argument for why we might not expect to find a mismatch, even for much larger dollars. Ah, the argument about the shape of the function's peak. Yeah, something about derivatives and symmetry. Can you unpack that a bit? Sure. The idea, roughly, is to look at the derivatives of that continuous function, $ln(x)$, right at its peak, $6x$ any dollar. As $c_g$ gets bigger, the ratio of the third derivative to the second derivative gets smaller and smaller quite rapidly. Okay, what does that ratio tell us? Well, intuitively, a smaller third derivative relative to the second suggests the peak is becoming more symmetric. Think of a standard bell curve, it's very symmetric. If the peak becomes increasingly symmetric and also broadens out, then the highest point, when you only consider integers, is much more likely to be right at the integer closest to the actual continuous peak. Exactly. The pull towards $k$ plus $v$ 1 or $k$ hello 1 becomes less significant compared to the height at $k$ 1. It makes a mismatch less probable. Got it. So it's a plausible explanation for the observation, but as the OEIS entry carefully notes, it's a heuristic. It gives us a good feeling, but it's not a formal mathematical proof. That's a critical distinction, yes. Proving it rigorously would be a different, likely much harder task. But the heuristic aligns well with the strong empirical data. It's also neat to see the OEIS entry mentioning historical references, like tables of the exponential function from way back in the 1930s, puts the sequence in context. It does. It shows that understanding $e$ and its properties, including how it relates to integers, has been a longstanding mathematical endeavor. And true to OEIS form, there are cross-references, a year 000149, which is the floor of 119, the ceiling of $1. So rounding down and rounding up, respectively. Right. And even A00216 here, which is the nearest integer to time, it really shows how these ideas connect across different sequences. Those links are invaluable. They let you jump between related concepts and see how changing the constant or the rounding rule affects the resulting sequence. It opens up avenues for comparison and further questions. Looking at the keywords for A000227, we seen non-negative, easy, because the definition is simple. Relatively simple, yes. And nice. And I think nice really captures this surprising connection to the function maximization problem we've been discussing. I'd agree. It points to an aesthetically pleasing or mathematically interesting property. And seeing the last modified date reminds you the OEIS isn't static. It's constantly being updated and refined. Absolutely. It's a living library. So wrapping up on A000227. It starts with the basic concept, rounding, but quickly leads to this deeper question about where a related function achieves its maximum value among integers. And the answer, based on extensive testing, seems to be remarkably consistent. The maximum occurs at the nearest integer to $e$. Which leaves us, especially those interested in number theory, pondering why. Is there some fundamental reason buried in the properties of the exponential function and integer distributions that dictates this incredibly tight coupling? That's the lingering thought, isn't it? Does this hint at a principle connecting continuous functions and discrete maximization that's particularly strong for $e$? What happens for even larger $n$? Or perhaps for functions based on other constants? It certainly gives you something to mull over. It does. We definitely encourage you, the listener, to explore A000227 and its related sequences further in the OEIS. Thanks for joining us on this deep dive.
