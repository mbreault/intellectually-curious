## Description

We explore how hexagonal polyominoes (polyhexes) are counted by A000228 and how their boundaries can be encoded as words in a free group. From coloring arguments to Conwayâ€“Lagariasâ€™s group-theoretic tiling framework, tiling becomes an algebraic operation with conjugacy and normal-subgroup structure. We also look at homomorphisms like a signed-area map that detects obstructions and discuss how symmetry and boundary invariants of polyhexes connect to the counting sequence, offering insights for number-theory-minded students.

## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today we're looking at something that sort of bridges simple shapes with surprisingly deep math, hexagonal polyominoes. How's it called polyhexes, yeah? Right, polyhexes. And we're doing this with our number theory students in mind, particularly looking at sequence A000228 in the OEIS. Ah, yes, the sequence that counts them. How many polyhexes you can make with N hexagonal cells? Exactly. And, you know, just looking at the numbers 1, 1, 3, 7, 22, and so on, it might seem, well, just like a list. It does, initially. But the actual shapes these numbers represent and how they fit together, that's where things get really fascinating. It connects to all sorts of cool mathematical ideas. Definitely. Tiling problems are often a great entry point. How do these shapes cover a surface? It immediately hints at their underlying structure. Okay, so let's maybe start there. We found a great explanation from Mathematics and Such that uses a tiling puzzle to introduce some of these deeper concepts. It's not directly about A000228's polyhexes at first, but it gets us there. A related problem sets the stage nicely. Yeah, so imagine this specific large shape made of hexagons. The question is, can you tile it, cover it completely, with 20 smaller triangular pieces? Each little triangle is made of three hexagons stuck together. Right, and the way they prove it's impossible is, well, it's quite elegant. It involves coloring. The classic coloring argument. So you color the whole hexagonal grid, right, like a pattern. Yes, with three colors. Let's say green, orange, and blue, repeating in a regular pattern. Okay, and this specific large shape we're trying to tile, it turns out it has, let me check the numbers, 18 green hexagons, 21 orange, and 21 blue. That's the crucial count. Now think about one of the small triangular tiling pieces. Because of how the grid is colored, any single triangular piece must cover exactly one green, one orange, and one blue hexagon. Always. Ah, okay. One of each. So if you could tile the big shape with 20 of these triangles... Then you'd need the large shape to have exactly 20 green, 20 orange, and 20 blue hexagons. But it doesn't. It has 18 green, 21 orange, 21 blue. The numbers don't match. Precisely. There's a mismatch in the color counts. So the tiling is impossible. It's a straightforward contradiction. Simple, but really effective. It shows the power of looking at these kinds of invariants. It does. But this coloring method, it has its limits. The source then presents a harder variation. Right, where the trick doesn't work anymore. Exactly. Another shape, also impossible to tile with those same triangles, but this time it does have an equal number of green, orange, and blue hexagons. So the coloring argument tells you nothing. Okay, so if the simple coloring fails, you need something more powerful. And that's where the heavy hitters come in. That's where we move towards group theory. Specifically, the Conway-Legarius method from their really seminal 1990 paper on tiling and combinatorial group theory. Group theory, okay. Don't let the name scare you off. It's essentially about studying structure and symmetry, right? And here it lets us turn the geometric problem of tiling... Into an algebraic one. Using the language of groups. So how does that work? They introduce something called the free group. Yes, a free group. Let's imagine moving on a grid. You can go right, left, up, or down. We can represent these moves with symbols, say X for right, X for left, Y for up, and U for down. Okay, like steps. Exactly. A word in this free group is just a sequence of these steps, like XYXL. A path. A path, precisely. And we care about reduced words. That means canceling out any steps that immediately reverse each other. So X followed by XR just disappears. You simplify the path. Right, like taking a step right and then immediately left gets you nowhere, so you just remove that part of the sequence. Makes sense. And combining words... Just stick them together, end to end, and then reduce again. Concatenate and simplify. That's the group operation. Got it. Now, the clever part, how do you connect this back to the actual shapes? You trace the boundary, pick a starting point on the edge of your polyomino, and walk around it, say, counterclockwise. For each edge segment you traverse, you record the corresponding group element, X, X, U, Y, or U, based on its direction on the grid. When you get back to the start, you have a sequence of these symbols. A word. A word in the free group that represents the perimeter of the shape. Exactly. It encodes the boundary. For instance, the large triangular figure in the problem would have its own specific, quite long perimeter word. That's really neat, turning a shape into an algebraic word. But what if I start tracing from a different point on the edge? Do I get a different word? You do get a different word, yes. But it's related to the first one in a very specific way within the group. It's what we call a conjugate. A conjugate. Like the same loop just described from a different starting position. That's a great way to think about it. If L is the word for the loop from the old start point, and P is the path word to get to the new start point, the new loop word L is basically POLP. Same essential loop structure, just shifted. Okay, so each shape corresponds to a word, or really a whole class of conjugate words. How does this help with the tiling problem itself? Well, think about putting tiles together. When you tile shape C with shapes A and B, the boundary of C is essentially formed by pieces of the boundaries of A and B, with the shared internal edges canceling out. Ah, like the reduction process in the free group. Exactly. The perimeter word of the tiled shape C can be obtained by multiplying the perimeter words of the tiles A and B, or their conjugates, depending on orientation and start points, in the free group. The internal edges cancel out in the group multiplication. So tiling implies an algebraic relationship between the perimeter words. The source mentions something about normal subgroups here. Yes, conceptually, if shape C with word C is tiled by pieces A and B with words A and B, then C must lie within the normal subgroup generated by A and B. It basically means C can be built up from A and B using the group operations and conjugation. Okay, that's the framework. Now, how did Conway and Lagarias use this to prove that harder variation case was impossible, where the coloring didn't work? They introduced another layer, a homomorphism. Think of it as a mapping, let's call it phi, from the free group F, where our words live, to the integers. A function that respects the group structure. Precisely. And this specific is designed cleverly. Phi gives you the net signed area enclosed by the path W. Counterclockwise paths give positive area, clockwise give negative. Basically, it counts the number of hexagons inside the loop. Okay, area counting via algebra. And this has a key property related to the basic steps. Yes. The value of phi for a single step, like phi x or phi k, is either plus one or minus one. This has a crucial consequence when you look at the perimeter words for the small triangular tiling pieces. Let me guess, the value for those triangle words turns out to be something specific. It turns out that phi f and b, the area associated with the perimeter words of the triangular tiles, must always be even integers. Always even. Okay. And the large shape they couldn't tile, the one from the harder variation? They calculated phi the value for the perimeter word C of that large untileable shape. And they found... It was odd. It was odd. And that is the contradiction. Ah, because if you could tile shape C with the triangles A and B, then C would be related to A and B through multiplication and conjugation in the group. And since A is a homomorphism, phi would have to be related to A and B through addition. So phi would have to be a sum of even numbers, since phi and c are even, and conjugation doesn't change the value. Exactly. A sum of even numbers must be even. But phi was calculated to be odd. That's impossible. Therefore, the tiling itself must be impossible. Wow. That's much more sophisticated than the coloring argument. It is. It beautifully shows how abstract algebraic structures can provide really powerful tools to solve concrete geometric questions. Absolutely stunning. Okay, let's loop this back to our original focus. The OEIS sequence A000228, counting those hexagonal polyominoes. We spent time on a tiling problem with triangular pieces on a hex grid. But the underlying machinery associating group words with boundaries on this grid is directly applicable to the hexagonal polyominoes themselves. Right, so each of the shapes counted by A000228, each polyhex with N cells, also has a perimeter word in this free group. Yes, absolutely. You can trace the boundary of any polyhex and get its corresponding word, or rather its conjugacy class of words. So while A000228 just gives us the number of shapes, studying the algebraic properties of these associated words could tell us much more about the shapes themselves. It could indeed. Things like symmetry in the polyhex might translate into specific
