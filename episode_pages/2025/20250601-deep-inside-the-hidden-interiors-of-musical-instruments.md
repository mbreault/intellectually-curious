## Transcript

Welcome to the Dep Dive. Today we are plunging headfirst into a truly incredible unseen world, the fascinating interiors of musical instruments. Yeah, it's pretty amazing stuff. We're diving into this unique project by photographer Charles Brooks, guided by an article that really lays out how he captures these hidden spaces. It's this mix of art, engineering, and frankly, sheer persistence. Right, and our mission today is to unpack this work. Not just, you know, the technical hurdles Brooks had to jump over, but also to really appreciate the surprising, almost architectural structures hiding inside things we might see or hear every day. Finding wonder in unexpected places. Exactly, getting into the nitty gritty of how someone even attempts something this wild. Okay, so let's start with Charles Brooks himself. It's fascinating because he didn't just like stumble into this as a photographer. He spent years as a principal cellist performing all over the world. Ah, so he really knew instruments from the inside out, figuratively speaking, at first. Precisely. That deep hands-on understanding clearly shapes his work. It feels less like just photographing an object and more like exploring a place he knows intimately. That connection makes a lot of sense. And the project itself, it really kicked off during a very specific time, didn't it? COVID-19. Yeah, that was the catalyst. Musicians couldn't perform, so instruments ended up in workshops for maintenance. Brooks saw this window. He'd seen photos from inside instruments before, but they often looked, well, disassembled. Like a dissection. Exactly. He wanted to capture them with everything intact, as they are when they're played. And that decision, keeping them intact, that must have been the starting point for all the technical headaches that followed. That's the key. It dictated everything else. His first go was with a cello, his own instrument, using a standard probe lens, something like the Laowa brand. Okay, a probe lens, so like a long, thin lens. Right. And with the cello, it was relatively straightforward. You could just remove the spike at the bottom of the end pin and get the lens inside. Simple enough, relatively speaking. I think I saw that cello shot online, actually. It really caught people's attention. But then, scaling down to smaller instruments, that's where the trouble started, I imagine. That's where the seemingly simple idea hits reality. Hard. The standard probe lens was just too big for, say, a violin. He apparently even tried heating it slightly to make it smaller. Really? Wow. Yeah, which helped him squeeze into pianos after some modification. But his ultimate goal, the sort of holy grail item, was a Stradivarius violin. And a Stradivarius. How small is the opening on that? Tiny. That's where the real deep technical rabbit hole began. A violin, even a legendary Strad, only has about a 5mm hole at the bottom of the end pin hole. Standard photo lenses, even those probe lenses, just wouldn't fit. 5mm. Okay. Yeah, that's minuscule. So this forced him to abandon traditional photo gear for the actual image capture and look at completely different tools. Things like medical cameras. Medical cameras, like endoscopes. Exactly. Endoscopes or arthroscopes. The kind designed for navigating incredibly small, dark spaces inside the human body. Wait, so he's repurposing surgical equipment for photography. That's quite a leap. But those scopes, aren't they designed for tiny video sensors, not for high-res photos on a photographer's camera? That was the next massive problem. You've got this tiny scope designed for a tiny sensor. If you try to attach it to a larger camera sensor, like a full-frame camera, most of the sensor gets no image. You just see this small circular picture in the middle, totally unusable vignetting. Right, like looking through a keyhole onto a movie screen. Kind of, yeah. So to enlarge that usable image circle to cover a bigger sensor, he had to start physically stacking multiple adapters and magnifiers between the scope and the camera body. And I know enough about optics to guess that adding more glass isn't usually good for image quality. Adapters, magnifiers. That sounds like a recipe for fuzziness. Precisely. That's the big compromise. Every extra piece of glass introduces potential for distortion, color fringing, just general softness. Plus, these tiny scopes themselves are already operating right at the edge of physics, dealing with something called diffraction. Ah, diffraction. That's the fundamental limit, isn't it? When light passes through a really tiny opening, it spreads out and you lose sharpness. Exactly. The aperture is so incredibly small that just magnifying the image doesn't actually give you more detail. It just gives you, as he put it, a bigger, blurrier image. You're literally fighting physics. So you need enough magnification to fill the sensor, but not so much that diffraction makes it uselessly blurry. What a balance act. It really is. And after a lot of trial and error, adapters apparently falling to pieces, talking to manufacturers, he found a specific camera body that hits the sweet spot. The micro four-thirds Panasonic Lumix G9 II. Micro four-thirds. So a smaller sensor than full frame, but bigger than the tiny ones in medical scopes. Right. It was the largest sensor he could effectively use with his scope and adapter setup without it becoming completely impractical. And he used his high-resolution mode, which combines multiple shots, to help deal with things like the vignetting and get larger final images. Okay, so he's got the scope, the adapters, the camera. But even then, the amount of light getting through that tiny five millimeter hole, then through all that glass, it must have been practically nothing. Almost zero light reaches the sensor. The effective aperture of this whole contraption is something like F250. F250? That's astronomical. Normal photos are like F1.8 to F11, maybe? It's an insane number. So his solution was basically brute force. Multiple flashes fired at their absolute maximum power. Okay, lots of light. But flashes generate heat, don't they? And you're sticking this inside delicate, often priceless, old wooden instruments. That was the next terrifying issue. Heat. Old instrument varnish is incredibly fragile. It absolutely cannot get hotter than about 28 degrees Celsius, which is roughly 82 Fahrenheit. Any hotter and it bubbles or cracks. It can bubble, craze, basically permanent damage to these irreplaceable historical artifacts. So he had to constantly monitor the temperature inside the instrument. How did he even do that? Likely with small sensors, monitoring carefully. He had to take long breaks between flashes, sometimes just one flash, then wait, let it cool down. You're not just juggling light and focus. You're battling thermodynamics while holding potentially a million dollar piece of history. That is intense. I can't even imagine the stress. That constant tension between the technical needs and preserving the instrument just defines the whole project. And the imaging process itself is, well, astonishingly complex. He combines two really demanding techniques, focus stacking and panoramic stitching. Okay, break that down. How does that work inside a violin? He positions the probe, usually through that end pin hole, and then rotates it inside, kind of like the hand of a clock sweeping around. He captures dozens of small sections of the interior this way. Like taking lots of little photos to stitch together into one big view. Exactly, that's the panoramic part. But then there's the focus stacking. Remember that diffraction problem and the tiny depth of field? Right, the scope can only focus on a really shallow slice at a time, maybe just two millimeters deep. Precisely. So to get one of those small sections completely sharp from front to back, so it doesn't look like a typical macro shot with a blurry background that screams tiny object, he has to take maybe 20 to 30 photos of that one small spot. Each photo is focused at a slightly different distance. 20 or 30 shots just for one tiny part of the panorama. Yes, that's the focus stacking. Later, software combines the sharpest bits from each of those 20, 30 shots into one fully sharp image for that section. Wow, okay. That sounds like a nightmare just for one angle, let alone the whole interior. And it gets even more complex. To manage potential image noise from the sensor heating up slightly, even with flashes, he uses techniques from astrophotography, like taking dark frames pictures with the lens cap on to identify and remove hot pixels. Like calibrating the sensor noise. Essentially, yes. Plus, the light coming through the scope isn't perfectly even. There's vignetting, dark patches. So he compensates by first photographing a plain white piece of paper with the same setup to map out those dark spots. Then he takes extra shots specifically aimed at those areas inside the instrument. Good grief. So let me recap. For just one tiny section inside, rotate the probe, take 20, 30 focus stacked shots, take dark frames, maybe take extra shots for dark spots, and then repeat that dozens, maybe hundreds of times for the whole interior. That's the process. The article says no final image is made from fewer than 100 individual shots, and some use over 1,000 separate frames. 1,000 photos for one final picture. The post-production work must be absolutely monumental. It's easily the most time-consuming part, meticulously blending all those focus stacks and panorama sections together seamlessly. But it's all done for a specific, and I think brilliant reason, to create this illusion of scale. Ah, yes, because when you look at the photos, they don't look like tiny spaces. They look vast, like huge halls or caverns. Exactly. Brooks intentionally uses these techniques to make the instrument interiors feel like grand architectural spaces, not miniatures. How does the focus stacking help with that illusion beyond just sharpness? Well
