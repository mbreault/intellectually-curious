## Transcript

Welcome back to our deep dive into the OEIS. Yeah, it's always exciting to jump into these sequences. You can say that again. Today we're taking a look at A000143. Ah, yes, the sums of eight squares. It sounds simple enough, right? Just adding up squares. Well, it starts off simple, but trust me, it gets interesting. I bet. So for our listeners just getting started with this sequence. Yeah, for those who are new to A000143. What exactly are we dealing with here? So this sequence, it lists the number of ways. Okay. The number of ways to do what? To represent any non-negative integer. Like 0, 1, 2, and so on. Exactly as the sum of eight squares. Eight squares, that's a lot of squares. It is, and there's a twist. Okay, what's the catch? Both the order and the signs matter. So it's not just about the final sum. Right, it's about the arrangement too. Can you give us an example? Sure, so let's say we have 1, 1, 100, 0, 0, 0, 0. Okay, eight numbers there. Now that's a different representation from 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0. Oh, because the ones are in different spots. Exactly, even though the sum is the same. Interesting, so the position makes a difference. It does, and the signs too. Ah, you mean like using a negative one versus a positive one? Exactly, like negative 1, 2 plus 12 is different from just using two positive ones. So we're being very specific about how we add these squares. Absolutely, and that attention to detail leads to fascinating observations. Like what? What kind of patterns do we see in this sequence? We'll take a zero, the very first term. The number of ways to represent zero is a sum of eight squares. Right, well all eight squares have to be zero to sum to zero. So there's only one way to do it. Exactly, making a zero equal to one. Makes sense, it seems like a simple starting point. Now let's jump to A1. Representing one as a sum of eight squares. We have eight positions to place a one or a negative one. And for each position, there are two sign choices. You got it, so we have eight times two. Which gives us 16 possibilities. So A1 is 16. Okay, I'm starting to see how the number of possibilities increases. And it gets bigger quickly. A2 jumps all the way to 112. Wow, so things escalate pretty rapidly. They do, which is why we have a computational formula. A formula? To help us calculate these values. Exactly, it's a systematic way to find An for any n. I'm curious, what does this formula look like? It's An, 16, neg 1, 2 1 n d minus 1 d d 3. Whoa, okay, that looks a bit intimidating. It might seem that way at first, but let's break it down. I'm all for making complex things easier to understand. All right, so let's focus on the summation first. The part with the sigma symbol. Yes, that's the sum d n d 0 neg 1 d d 3 part. What does all that mean? It means we're summing over all the positive divisors of n. Okay, so if n is 2, its divisors are 1 and 2. Exactly, and for each divisor, we cube it. Okay, so for 1, we get 1 cubed, which is just 1. And for 2, we get 2 cubed, which is 8. Right, and then what do we do with those cubed divisors? We multiply each one by negative 1 raised to the power of that divisor. So for 1, it would be negative 1, 1, which is negative 1. And for 2, it would be negative 1, 2, 8, which is positive 8. Okay, so we have neg 1 and 8, and then we add them together. You got it. So for n is 2, the sum would be negative 1 plus 8, which is 7. So we've tackled the summation part, what's next? Now we multiply that sum by 16 and by Nepling 1 n. So for n goes 2, that's 16, neg 1, 2, 7. Which simplifies to 112, exactly what we got before. Wow, so those alternating signs and cubed divisors really do work together. It's pretty neat, right? It shows the elegance of number theory. Definitely. And it gives us a way to calculate An for any n. Exactly. It's a powerful tool, especially when n gets large. So we've got this formula, but you mentioned there's another way. Ah, yes. We can also express the sum using Sigma notation. You mean like 3n even, 3n odd? You got it. This represents the difference. The difference between what? Between the sums of cubed even divisors and cubed odd divisors. Okay, I think I'm following you. So 3n even is the sum of the cubed even divisors of n. And 3n odd is the sum of the cubed odd divisors. Exactly. This can be a more efficient way to compute the values. Especially for larger numbers, I imagine. You're right. It simplifies the calculation quite a bit. It's fascinating how there are multiple paths to the same result. It's one of the beautiful things about math, wouldn't you say? Absolutely. But speaking of different paths, you also mentioned a generating function. Ah, yes. The generating function for this sequence is theta 3q8. Theta 3q8. Now that sounds even more complicated. It might look that way, but the key is the Jacobi theta function. A function within a function. In a way, yes. It's a fascinating function found in advanced number theory. So our sums of squares sequence connects to some pretty high-level math. It does. It shows how interconnected math can be, even from simple concepts. Like those Russian nesting dolls, open one and there's another inside. Exactly. And in this case, A000143 is one of those outer dolls. Leading us to these deeper concepts like modular forms and theta functions. Precisely. But for now, let's focus on another interesting aspect. Okay, what else is there to explore with A000143? Well, there's the multiplicative property of this sequence. Multiplicative property. What's that all about? So we can express An as 16bn for any n greater than or equal to 1. Okay, so we have this new function bn. Right, and what makes bn special is that it's multiplicative. Meaning what exactly? It means if you know the value for prime power. Prime powers like 2 squared, 3 cubed, and so on. Exactly. You can easily calculate bn for any number. Hmm. So knowing the value for prime powers unlocks everything else. In a way, yes. It simplifies the calculation tremendously. And how do we find the value of bn for these prime powers? We have specific formulas for that depending on the prime. Different formulas. Yes. For odd primes, it's bp, yeah, p3e plus 3, 1, 3, 1. Okay, and what about for the prime number 2? For 2, it's b2e, p3e plus 3, 1, 7, 2. Those look a bit complicated. They might seem that way, but they make calculations much easier. Especially when dealing with large numbers with many factors, I imagine. You got it. Let's try an example, shall we? Sure. How about we calculate a2 again using this method? Perfect. So first we need to find b2. Since 2 is a prime number, we use the formula for p2. That's right. So b2e, 2, 3e plus 3, 1, 7, 2. And in this case, e is 1. So b2, 26, 1, 7, 2, which simplifies to 7. All right, so we have b2 is 7. Now what? Now we simply multiply that by 16 to get a2. So a2 equals 16, 7, which is 112, just like before. Exactly. It's amazing how it all comes together. It is. And prime numbers seem to play a crucial role again. They truly are the building blocks of number theory. This multiplicative property gives us another way to navigate this sequence. It does, and it hints at the deeper structure underlying A000143. I'm definitely intrigued to learn more. Well, there's much more to uncover. Join us in part two to delve deeper. We'll unravel the secrets of modular forms and theta functions. It's going to be a fascinating journey. I can't wait. Welcome back to our deep dive. I'm ready to explore more of this sequence. Great. We left off talking about modular forms and theta functions. Those are some pretty advanced concepts. They are, but we can understand them without getting too technical. Okay, I'm all ears. All right, so imagine a kaleidoscope. With all its colorful pattern. Exactly. Now imagine turning it. The patterns change, but there's still symmetry. Right. That's kind of like a modular form. Instead of physical rotations, it's mathematical transformations. Precisely. These forms have a remarkable degree of symmetry. So even as they transform, they maintain a certain structure. You got it. They're well behaved under these transformations. And what makes these well
