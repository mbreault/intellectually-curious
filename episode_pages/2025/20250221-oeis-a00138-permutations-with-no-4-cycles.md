## Description

In this episode we explore OEIS A00138â€”the number of permutations of n elements whose cycle decompositions contain no 4-cycles. We unpack the inclusion-exclusion formula that counts these permutations, see how the 4-cycle restriction connects to a generating function tied to the exponential series, and discuss the resulting asymptotic growth. We also peek at the surprising link to the alternating group inside the symmetric group, and walk through the concrete n=4 case (there are 18 such permutations) to illustrate the idea.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. We're continuing our deep dive into the amazing world of integer sequences from the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. It's really a treasure trove for anyone interested in number theory. Oh, absolutely. Each sequence is like its own little puzzle with unique mathematical properties. Today, we're going to tackle sequence A00138. A00138, okay. And what's special about this one? This one's all about permutations, but with a twist. Permutations, those rearrangements of things? Right, exactly. But here's the catch. We're only looking at permutations in the symmetric group S. Symmetric group S. Could you unpack that a bit for folks who might not be familiar with those terms? Sure thing. Let's imagine you have, say, four objects. Could be numbers, colors, anything, really. Okay, I'm picturing four colorful blocks. Perfect. The symmetric group, which we call S4 in this case, is the set of all possible ways to rearrange those blocks. So every single possible order those four blocks could be in. Yep, you got it. Every single shuffle, every arrangement, that's the symmetric group. Okay, that makes sense. So where do the permutations with a twist come in? Well, sequence A00138 zeros in on permutations in spin that have a particular quirk in their cycle decomposition. They can't contain any four cycles. Hold on, cycle decomposition. Maybe we should break that down too. It sounds a bit technical. No problem. It's actually simpler than it sounds. Every permutation, like that rearranging of the blocks we talked about, can be broken down into cycles. Like mini shuffles within the bigger shuffle? You could think of it that way. Let's take an example. Say we have the permutation 1, 3, 2, 4. This means 1 goes to 3, 3 goes to 2, 2 goes to 4, and 4 cycles back to 1. Okay, I see. Everything shifts over one spot, and the last one wraps around to the front. Right, that's a cycle of length 4. Now, A00138 is all about those permutations that don't have any cycles of that length. So in our colorful blocks example, we're looking for arrangements where no group of four blocks ends up back in their original order after shuffling. Exactly. And that's where it gets interesting, because this seemingly simple constraint leads to some pretty cool connections in group theory and combinatorics. Okay, now I'm really intrigued. But before we dive into those connections, maybe we could walk through a concrete example or two, just to make sure everyone's on the same page. Absolutely, that's a great idea. Let's take a look at the example given in the OEIS entry for 18. 18, what does that mean exactly? It means there are 18 permutations of four objects, remember our colorful blocks, that don't contain a four cycle. And we can actually list them out to see why there are exactly 18 of them. Okay, let's do it. It'll be fun to see how this whole no-four-cycle thing plays out in practice. Great, so let's get started. All right, so we're searching for these permutations, these arrangements that don't have any four cycles. But the OEIS entry also gives us a formula for figuring out how many there are. And I gotta say, it looks a bit intimidating, all those symbols. Yeah, it can seem that way at first, but it's actually pretty elegant once you break it down. Okay, break it down for me. I see the factorial part, the n, that's just multiplying all the whole numbers up to n, right? Right, exactly. But then we've got those alternating signs, the pluses and minuses, and the powers of four. Those are the real workhorses of the formula. What are they doing exactly? Well, they're making sure we only count the permutations we're interested in, the ones without the four cycles. Hmm, okay, I'm listening. The alternating signs with that 1i, they help us add and subtract the right terms to kind of filter out the permutations that have four cycles. And the powers of four, well, they're tied to the length of the cycle we're trying to avoid. So it's like a mathematical sieve sifting out the permutations we don't want and leaving us with just the right ones. Precisely. And you know what's really neat? This formula has another side to it. We can look at it through the lens of generating functions. Generating functions. Yeah, think of it as a way to pack an entire infinite sequence of numbers into a single function. That sounds like some serious mathematical wizardry. How can one function hold an entire infinite sequence? It's all about the coefficients of the function. Imagine a power series, an infinite sum of terms with increasing powers of, say, x. The coefficients of those x terms can represent the numbers in our sequence. The generating function is like a container for those coefficients. So how does that connect to our formula for A00138, the one with all the factorials and powers of four? Well, if we play around with the formula a bit, rearrange things, we start to see a connection to a very familiar function, the exponential function, x. The right-hand side of our formula, after we rearrange it, starts to look like the power series expansion of x. Except instead of just x, we have negative 14. Whoa, so we're seeing the exponential function hiding within our formula for A00138. That's pretty wild. It is, isn't it? And it's not just a coincidence. It points to a deep relationship between our sequence and the wider world of continuous mathematics. Remember that asymptotic formula mentioned in the OEIS entry, the one that tells us how the sequence grows for large values of n? Yeah, it said that for large n, the terms of the sequence are approximately equal to e14 times n. Right, and that e popping up there is a direct consequence of the generating function we were just talking about, the one connected to e, it's 44. That generating function gives us the sequence itself and clues about its growth pattern for large n. So we're getting a two-for-one deal, a nice formula for the sequence and insights into how it behaves as n gets really big, all thanks to these generating functions. Exactly, pretty powerful tools, these generating functions. But wait, there's more. There's another fascinating connection we haven't explored yet. It takes us back to group theory, specifically to a special subgroup within the symmetric group called the alternating group. Okay, now I'm really hooked. Let's dive into this alternating group and see how it ties in with our four-cycle avoiding permutations. All right, so we've spent some time with these special permutations, those that avoid having any four cycles in them. We've looked at the formula. We've even seen a connection to generating functions and the exponential function. Now you're saying there's a link to this thing called the alternating group. What is the alternating group exactly? Well, remember how we said the symmetric group, S, contains all the possible ways to rearrange n objects? It's like the club for all possible shuffles. Right, every single arrangement. The alternating group, which we write as N, is kind of like a VIP section within that larger group. It's a subset of N containing only certain special permutations. Okay, so what's the criteria to get into this VIP section? What makes a permutation alternating? It all come around to how you can build a permutation using swaps. Imagine you have those n objects, say they're numbered 1 through n. A swap, which we also call a transposition, just exchanges two of those objects. So instead of shuffling the whole sequence, we're just switching two things around. Yep, and the interesting thing is you can build any permutation you like just by doing a sequence of these swaps. Now here's the distinction. An even permutation is one that can be made using an even number of swaps, and an odd permutation needs an odd number of swaps. Okay, so even permutations use an even number of swaps, odd permutations use an odd number. Got it. But how does this tie back to our permutations that avoid four cycles? Well, there's a really intriguing numerical connection. Do you remember that asymptotic formula for A00138? It told us that for a large number of objects, roughly e14, of all the permutations in skin, avoid those four cycles. Yeah, I remember. So for a large n, that's roughly the proportion of permutations that fit our special rule. Right, and guess what? The proportion of even permutations in skin, the ones that make up the alternating group, that proportion is also approximately e14 for large n. Hold on. Are you saying that the proportion of permutations without four cycles and the proportion of even permutations are basically the same when n gets large? That seems like more than just a coincidence. It does, doesn't it? And while it's not true that every permutation without a four cycle is automatically an even permutation, this numerical connection hints at a deeper relationship. It suggests that there's something special going on between these four cycle avoiding permutations and the structure of this alternating group. It's like these permutations we've been focusing on are giving us a peek into some hidden structure within the symmetric group, a structure that's related to this whole idea of even and odd permutations. Exactly. That's what makes exploring these specific sequences from the OEIS so fascinating. We start with what seems like a simple rule, no four cycles allowed, and it leads us to these unexpected connections and a deeper understanding of mathematical structures like the symmetric and alternating groups. It's amazing how we've gone from counting permutations to generating functions, asymptotic analysis, and now the intricacies of group theory, all starting with this one rule about avoiding four cycles. Who knew it could be so enlightening? It really shows how interconnected mathematics is, doesn't it? And it leaves us with a question to ponder, what other hidden relationships
