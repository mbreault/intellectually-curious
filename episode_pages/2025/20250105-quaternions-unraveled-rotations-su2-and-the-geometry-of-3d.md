## Transcript

Welcome to another deep dive, and today we're going deep into the world of quaternions. It's one of those topics, you know, that I think a lot of people have heard of, but might not entirely understand, especially when it comes to their applications. And that's what we're really here to explore, right? How these seemingly abstract mathematical objects connect to real-world applications. Absolutely. And it's fascinating how quaternions have seen this resurgence in fields like, you know, computer graphics and robotics. It speaks to their elegance and their efficiency as a mathematical tool. Yeah, and that's something that really struck me when I was reading through the Wikipedia article on quaternions, and also a really interesting blog post by mathematician Terrence Tao, specifically on quaternions and spherical trigonometry. Those are our two main sources for this deep dive. One thing that blew me away was, you know, just how far back quaternions go. Like, they actually predate vectors. Right. Discovered back in 1843 by William Rowan Hamilton, the story goes that he was so excited about his discovery that he carved the fundamental formula into a bridge in Dublin. I love that story. It kind of shows, you know, how mathematicians can get really excited about these abstract concepts. But let's get back to the basics here. For someone who might not be familiar, what exactly is a quaternion? So basically, a quaternion is like a four-dimensional vector with one real component and three imaginary components. And these imaginary components, denoted as i, j, and k, are what make quaternions so unique. Okay, four-dimensional vector. Now that sounds pretty abstract. Can you break that down a bit further? Sure. Think of it this way. In our everyday three-dimensional world, we need three coordinates to specify a point, right? Like its position along the x, y, and z axes. Now imagine adding a fourth dimension. Quaternions essentially extend this idea to a four-dimensional space using four components to represent a point in that space. All right, that makes a bit more sense. But what about those imaginary components, i, j, and k? How do they work? Well, they have some peculiar properties. For starters, each of them, when squared, equals make a one. And they also interact with each other in a very specific way, which leads to a non-commutative system. Non-commutative. I'm guessing that means the order of multiplication matters. Exactly. Unlike regular multiplication, where, you know, 2 times 3 is the same as 3 times 2, with quaternions, the order makes a difference. For instance, multiplying i by j gives you k, but multiplying j by i gives you k. That might seem strange, but it's crucial for their ability to represent rotations. So it's like turning a Rubik's Cube, right? The sequence of rotations matters. You get a different result depending on the order. Precisely. That's a great analogy. And this order-dependent behavior, this non-commutativity, is what allows quaternions to elegantly capture the complexities of three-dimensional rotations. So how do they actually represent rotations? The blog post by Terence Tao talks about unit quaternions and their connection to rotations. Right. Unit quaternions, those with a magnitude of 1, can be thought of as points on the surface of a four-dimensional hypersphere. And each of these points corresponds to a specific rotation in three-dimensional space. Okay, I'm trying to picture a four-dimensional hypersphere, but it's a bit beyond my grasp. Can you maybe relate this back to something a bit more familiar, like rotations in two dimensions? Sure. Think about complex numbers. You know those numbers with a real and an imaginary part. Right. When you plot them on a plane, the complex numbers with a magnitude of one form a circle, the unit circle. And each point on that circle represents a specific rotation in two dimensions. Unit quaternions extend this concept to three dimensions. They're like the 3D counterpart of complex numbers on the unit circle. So each unit quaternion is like a code, a set of instructions for rotating an object in 3D space. That's a good way to think about it. And by performing calculations with these unit quaternions, we can combine rotations, find the equivalent of specific rotation angles, and much more. That sounds really powerful, especially compared to using rotation matrices, which I've always found a bit clunky. You're right. Quaternions offer a more elegant and efficient way to handle rotations, especially when dealing with complex sequences of rotations. One thing that caught my attention in the blog post was this idea of a double cover. Can you explain what that means in the context of quaternions and rotations? It's a fascinating concept. You see, when you rotate a point in 3D space by 360 degrees using quaternions, you don't actually end up back at the starting point. Instead, you end up with the negative of the original quaternion. It takes a 720-degree rotation, two full turns, to truly return to the original quaternion. So it's like you need to go around twice to complete a full cycle. Exactly. And this double cover is a consequence of the unique topology of the quaternion system. It's one of those mind-bending aspects of mathematics that reveals a deeper structure beneath the surface. That's pretty wild. Okay, so we've talked about how quaternions represent rotations in 3D space, but Terence Tao's blog post also delves into how they connect to spherical trigonometry, which seems like a bit of a jump. How can something as abstract as quaternions be used to understand triangles on a sphere? It's all about perspective. If you visualize a unit quaternion as an arrow or a tangent vector on the surface of a unit sphere, multiplying this quaternion by another unit quaternion essentially rotates this arrow or moves it along a geodesic, which is like a great circle on the sphere. So we're using quaternions to manipulate these arrows on a sphere, which are like representations of points or directions on the sphere's surface. Precisely. And by manipulating these arrows, these tangent vectors using quaternion multiplication, we can capture the essence of spherical geometry. And that's where Tao's fundamental relation comes in, right? The equation he presents in his blog post that connects the sides and angles of a spherical triangle. Exactly. Equation 4 in his blog is like the Rosetta Stone of spherical trigonometry. It links the sides and angles of a spherical triangle through quaternion multiplication. This one equation essentially encapsulates the entire system of spherical trigonometry. From this single equation, you can derive all the classic rules like the spherical cosine rule and the spherical sine rule. Wow, so it's like a master key that unlocks the complexities of spherical geometry. It really is. And to make this even more concrete, Tao uses the example of the sunrise equation. You can actually apply quaternions to calculate the time of sunrise and sunset based on latitude and the sun's declination. So we're going from abstract rotations in four-dimensional space to understanding something as everyday as the sunrise. That's remarkable. It really highlights the power of mathematics to connect seemingly disparate concepts. It does. And it shows how quaternions, despite their abstract nature, have tangible connections to the world we experience. This is already blowing my mind. And I have a feeling we've only just scratched the surface of what quaternions can do. We've only just begun. There's so much more to explore. There's a whole universe within quaternions just waiting to be explored. Like what? What else can we do with these things? Well, for starters, we can delve deeper into their connection to group theory. Okay, group theory. Now, that's an area of mathematics that always seemed a bit intimidating to me. It can be, but it's also incredibly beautiful and powerful. Essentially, group theory studies the structure of sets with operations that satisfy certain properties. And quaternions play a key role in understanding a specific group, the 3D rotation group. So all those rotations we've been talking about, they form a group. Exactly. Think about it. You can combine rotations. You can have an identity rotation doing nothing. And every rotation has an inverse. That's the essence of a group. And quaternions provide a way to represent and manipulate these rotations within that group structure. Precisely. And they do it in a much more elegant and efficient way than, say, using rotation matrices. I always found rotation matrices a bit clunky, especially when you start dealing with multiple rotations. You and me both. Rotation matrices can get really messy, and they're prone to problems like gimbal lock, where you lose a degree of freedom. Yeah, gimbal lock. That's always a pain in the neck when you're trying to smoothly rotate objects in 3D. Exactly. Quaternions completely avoid that issue. They're much more robust and computationally efficient, which is why they're so popular in computer graphics and robotics. Makes sense. So where does this group called SU2 fit into all of this? The Wikipedia article mentions that unit quaternions are related to this group. Ah, yes. SU2, the special unitary group of degree 2. It sounds complicated, but it's essentially another way to represent rotations. And it turns out that unit quaternions and SU2 are isomorphic. Isomorphic? That's an interesting one. We talked about isomorphism earlier when discussing Tao's fundamental relation. Right. Isomorphism means they have the same underlying structure, even if they look different on the surface. It's like having two different languages that express the same ideas in different ways. So we have unit quaternions, we have SU2, and they're both essentially talking about the same thing, rotations in 3D space. Exactly. It's a beautiful example of how different areas of mathematics can converge and intertwine. Now, the Wikipedia article
