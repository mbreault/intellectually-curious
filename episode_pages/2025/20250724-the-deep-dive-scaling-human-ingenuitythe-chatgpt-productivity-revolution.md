## Transcript

You know, throughout history, we've seen these moments, these fundamental shifts in technology. Absolutely. Things like the wheel, the engine, electricity, even the transistor. They weren't just new gadgets, right? No, they changed everything. They totally reshaped how we live, how we work, how we connect. Laid down new infrastructure, really. And while it definitely feels like we're living through another one of those moments right now. It really does. The pace is something else. So today on The Deep Dive, we're going deep into the economic impact of ChatGPT. People are calling it a productivity revolution, and we want to see what that actually means. Yeah, cut through the hype a bit. Exactly. Our mission for you, our listener, is to give you a clear shortcut to understanding this massive shift. We're digging into recent insights direct from OpenAI's own data and research. Which is quite revealing. It is. We want to paint a picture of how AI, especially ChatGPT, is already changing work and, you know, boosting productivity across lots of different sectors. The goal is to really highlight the potential here for a broader economic opportunity. Because at its core, they say AI isn't just software. It's described as scaling human ingenuity itself. Our ability to think, learn, create, build. That's a powerful concept. It sounds huge, doesn't it? But what does scaling human ingenuity actually mean for the economy? For you? For living standards? Well, that's the critical question, isn't it? Because that idea ties directly into what economists call the productivity imperative. Okay. You see, for a while now, especially in the 2010s, U.S. labor productivity growth, well, it slowed right down. Right, I remember hearing about that. Yeah, average about 1.5% a year. That's a whole percentage point lower than the boom we saw back in the late 90s. Wow, okay. So generative AI is showing up now as a potential and maybe powerful answer to that challenge. And we have to remember, productivity, that's the essential ingredient. It's the bedrock for raising living standards, improving quality of life for everyone. Okay, right. So let's unpack this adoption piece first. Because when you talk about how fast the technology spreads, ChatGPT seems, well, it's in a league of its own. It really is. The numbers are staggering. I mean, one million users in just five days. Then it jumps to 100 million users in, what, two months? Two months. It's hard to even grasp that speed. And today, over 500 million users globally. Just phenomenal growth. And if you compare that, think about the internet or personal computers, ChatGPT was adopted way, way faster. Getting to 100 million monthly active users in two months. Its adoption rate within two years was basically twice that of the internet. Twice the internet's early adoption rate. That puts it in perspective. It really does. And it's reached so many people. Just two years after launch, two out of five U.S. adults said they'd used an AI product. That's incredibly fast integration. So what's fascinating here is why it spreads so quickly. What makes AI different from, say, the PC revolution or the internet rollout? Yeah, what's the secret sauce? Well, it seems to boil down to maybe three core things. First, it's just the ease of access. Okay, like the chat interface. Exactly. People get it. You type in a box. Prompting, just asking questions, it feels intuitive. There isn't this steep learning curve. So it's easy to adapt it to all sorts of tasks, personal stuff, work stuff, you name it. Okay, so ease of access is one. What else? Second is the low barrier to entry combined with high scalability. Meaning the free versions. Precisely. Companies like OpenAI offer free tiers. So you can experiment, play around, see if it's useful for you without spending a dime. Right, try before you buy, essentially. And once you find something that works, something valuable, it's generally pretty easy to scale up your usage. Okay, and the third thing? Just the sheer number of use cases. And crucially, there are so many more still being discovered. So it's not just for one specific thing. Not at all. People are using it for games, cooking help, serious data analysis, brainstorming creative ideas. The list goes on. And because they see benefits quickly, even small ones, it encourages them to keep trying it for new things. Which leads to more productivity gains. You got it. Continuous experimentation driven by tangible results. So putting that all together, this crazy fast adoption isn't just some tech fad. It really feels like a strong signal, a signpost for a meaningful impact on economic growth down the line. I think that's fair to say. You look at nearly all the economic forecasts, and even though the numbers vary a bit, they pretty much all agree. AI is expected to significantly boost productivity. That's a pretty consistent message. It is, a very strong indicator of the shifts that are already happening. Okay, so moving to the practical side. With all these millions of users, what are Americans actually doing with ChatGPT, especially at work? Yeah, this is where it gets really interesting. The shift in workplace usage is dramatic. How dramatic? Well, today, 28% of employed US adults say they use ChatGPT at work. That's up from just 8% in 2023. Wow, 8 to 28% in about a year. That's a huge jump. It's a massive adoption in the professional sphere, and the sheer volume is incredible. Globally, users send over 2.5 billion messages a day to the platform. Two and a half billion. Dory. Daily. And over 330 million of those are coming from the US each day. Okay, so what are all these messages about? What tasks are people using it for? The data shows some clear patterns. The biggest chunk, roughly 20% of US messages, is for learning and upskilling. Interesting, like a tutor? Exactly like a personalized tutor, available on demand. People are using it to grasp new concepts, learn new skills. It basically shrinks that gap between being curious about something and actually understanding it. That's powerful, democratizing knowledge almost. In a way, yes. Then the next biggest category is writing and communication. That's about 18% of messages. So emails, reports? Emails, marketing copy, even drafting tricky compliance documents. Things that used to take hours, people are doing in minutes. Which frees up brain power for other things. That's the idea, reallocating that sort of scarce cognitive bandwidth to higher value, more strategic tasks. Makes sense. What else? Well, for the more technical folks, programming, data science, and math account for about 7% of messages. And it's coding help? Yeah, both expert engineers using it for, say, generating boilerplate code or refactoring old stuff, and also maybe less experienced people, sometimes called vibe coders, using it to experiment and debug. Okay. Any other significant areas? There are smaller but still economically relevant segments, like design and creative ideation is around 5%, business analytics is 4%, and translation comes in at 2%. So a pretty wide range, even beyond the big ones. Definitely. It touches a lot of different professional activities. Now, you mentioned something interesting earlier about demographics. Ah, yes. If you zoom out and look at who is using it in the US, the user base skews noticeably younger. Oh, yeah. About 24% are between 18 and 24 years old, and another 32% are aged 25 to 34. So a big chunk are students and people early in their careers. Exactly, which means you have a whole generation becoming, you could say, AI natives. Like digital natives, but for AI. Precisely. They're integrating these tools into how they learn and work right from the start, and they'll carry that expertise into the workforce for decades. That could have some serious long-term economic ripple effects, couldn't it? Potentially huge compounding benefits over time, yes. So thinking about all these daily uses, learning faster, writing quicker, coding help, what stands out to you, our listener? Can you see how these small individual productivity bumps, when multiplied by millions, could start to add up to major economic change? It's a fascinating aggregation effect. Okay, so we've seen the rapid spread, we've seen what people are doing with it day to day. Now let's get specific. Let's zero in on the hard data. What are we actually seeing in terms of productivity gains in different industries? Especially ones dealing with lots of language or patterns where you'd expect AI to shine. Right, moving from individual use to industry impact. And the findings from enterprise customers and various studies are pretty compelling. Give us some examples. Okay, take legal services. One study using OpenAI's O1 model found lawyer productivity jumped between 34% and in some cases up to 140% across six different legal tasks. 140%? It is, and crucially, it wasn't just faster. The quality of the work improved too, especially for complex things like persuasive writing or legal analysis. Quality improvement is key. Okay, what else? How about customer acquisition and support? Call center agents using an OpenAI model were, on average, 14% more productive handling customer queries. Okay, 14% is solid. It is, and what's really interesting there is that the biggest gains were seen among the less skilled workers. Ah, so it helped level the playing field a bit. It suggests AI can be a powerful tool for augmenting foundational skills. Also in that area, content creators using AI reported saving over 11 hours a week on marketing materials. 11 hours a week? That's more than a full workday saved. Significant time savings. Then look at consulting.
