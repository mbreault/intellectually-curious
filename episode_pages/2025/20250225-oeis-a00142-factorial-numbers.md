## Description

We dive into A00142, the factorial numbers. From the curious fact that 0! = 1 to the evolution of factorial notation, we trace history and notation. Then we explore surprising properties and connections: Legendre's formula for prime factors and trailing zeros, Wilson's theorem, and the explosive growth of factorials alongside Stirling's approximation. We also survey related ideasâ€”double and falling factorials, primorials, subfactorials (derangements), superfactorialsâ€”and the gamma function that extends factorials to non-integer and complex values. All framed with a touch of history and cross-cultural roots.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into the world of the OEIS. Today, we're going to be exploring sequence A00142, factorial numbers. Factorial numbers. Now, as number theory students, you're probably already pretty familiar with factorials, but I'm betting there are some surprises in store as we sort of unpack its history and its properties and some unexpected applications. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to that. I think there's a lot there. So, okay, let's kick things off with just a really quick recap of what a factorial is. Sure. So a factorial is denoted by n, and it's the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Okay. So 5 would be 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1, which equals 120. Right. And another way to think about it is with what we call the recurrence relation. n equals n times n1. Okay, so you're saying that each factorial builds upon the one before it? Exactly. Okay, yeah, that seems straightforward enough. But I remember being completely baffled by 0 the first time I saw it. Right. Why does 0 factorial equal 1? Yeah, that's a question that trips up a lot of people. One way to understand it is to think about the number of ways to arrange 0 objects. There's only one way. You do nothing. It's an empty arrangement, but it's still an arrangement. Right. Yeah, that makes sense. Are there any other ways to explain it? Yeah, I think the concept of an empty product also helps. So in mathematics, we define the product of no numbers to be 1. Okay. It might seem a little strange, but this convention keeps things consistent across many formulas, particularly in combinatorics. Okay, speaking of combinatorics, I know that's where factorials really shine. Absolutely. Factorials are essential for calculating permutations, which is just a fancy way of saying arrangements. Okay. So for example, imagine you have five different books on a shelf. How many different ways could you arrange them? That would be five, which we already know is 120? Exactly. And this applies to all sorts of real-world situations, arranging people in a line, scheduling appointments, even figuring out how many different passwords you can create with a set of characters. So you're saying factorials help us to count the possibilities? Yeah. What about combinations where order doesn't matter, like choosing members for a team? Yeah, factorials are crucial for that, too. They form the basis for calculating binomial coefficients, which tell us how many ways we can choose a certain number of items from a larger set. Hmm. It's incredible how these seemingly simple factorials underlie so many different calculations. It is. I wouldn't have guessed that they had a history stretching back centuries. It's true. We actually see evidence of factorials in the Sefer Yetzirah, or the Book of Creation, which dates back to around 300 A.D.? Wow. It even mentions eight. Wow, so they were being studied by Jewish mystics all those years ago? Yes, and we also see evidence of their use in India around the same period. Hmm. It highlights how mathematical concepts transcend cultural boundaries. Yeah, it's fascinating to see how these ideas emerge in different parts of the world. Okay, let's shift gears for a moment and talk about how the notation for factorials evolved over time. Because mathematical notation is a language in itself, and it's fascinating to kind of trace its development. Yeah, for sure. The N that we use today wasn't always the standard. Right. Early mathematicians like Euler and Vandermonde had their own symbols. Euler, for example, used a capital M with a subscript. Oh, wow. That seems less concise than our current notation. It was. Then came Louis-Francois-Antoine Arbogast, who coined the term factorial. Okay. Which makes sense, considering it comes from the word factor. Right. However, it was Christian Cram in 1808 who introduced the N symbol that we're all familiar with today. I wonder if those early mathematicians would be surprised to see how their work has evolved. Was there anyone who resisted the new notation? There were other notations proposed, like the L symbol by Reverend Thomas Jarrett. Okay. Interestingly, this notation persisted in some regions for quite a while. And Augustus DeMorgan, a prominent 19th century mathematician, actually disliked the Gott symbol. He found it too informal, borrowing from the punctuation world. That's a great anecdote. It shows that even something as seemingly basic as notation can spark debate among mathematicians. Yeah. But despite DeMorgan's objections, N prevailed. It's a testament to how mathematical ideas are refined and adopted through collaboration over generations. Absolutely. So now that we've covered the basics and a bit of history, are you ready to dive into some properties of factorials that might surprise even seasoned number theory students? I'm all ears. Let's hear what you got. Okay, I'm ready for some surprises. What kind of hidden depths do factorials have? Well, let's start with divisibility. Okay. It's pretty obvious that N is divisible by all the positive integers up to N. Right. I mean, that's built into the definition. Yeah. But we can go a little deeper with Legendre's formula. I've heard of Legendre's formula, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Yeah. It's a really handy tool for understanding the prime factorization of a factorial. It tells us the exponent of each prime number in that factorization. So you're saying if we break down a factorial into its prime factors, Legendre's formula tells us how many times each prime shows up. Exactly. And this has a really cool connection to those trailing zeros you see when you calculate a large factorial. Right, like 10 ends with two zeros. Exactly. That's because each zero comes from a factor of 10, which is 2 times 5. Precisely. Legendre's formula helps us count those factors of 5 which determine the number of trailing zeros. That's a neat connection. What other surprising properties should we know about? Well, have you ever heard of Wilson's theorem? I have. It's a fascinating link between factorials and prime numbers. Wilson's theorem rings a bell, but I could use a refresher. Okay, so it states that N1 plus 1 is divisible by N if and only if N is a prime number. Wait, so you're saying we can use factorials to test if a number is prime? Exactly. It's a bit of a roundabout way to test for primarity. Yeah. But it highlights those unexpected connections that pop up in number theory. I'm starting to see that factorials are much more versatile than I initially thought. For sure, and we haven't even touched on how quickly they grow. Okay. Factorials get very large very fast. Their growth is faster than exponential, meaning they outpace functions like 2 to the N. That makes sense. You're multiplying more and more numbers together each time. Right. They grow almost as fast as N to the N, but with a slight exponential difference. Okay. And this rapid growth means that calculating factorials for large numbers can be quite computationally expensive. So how do we deal with that? Is there a way to estimate large factorials without having to do all the calculations? That's where Stirling's approximation comes in. Oh, yeah. It provides a remarkably accurate way to estimate large factorials. I remember seeing Stirling's formula, but it looked pretty intimidating. Yeah. Can you break it down for us conceptually? Sure. Essentially, it relates the factorial to a combination of square roots, powers of N and E and pi. Okay. It's a bit involved, but for large values of N, it provides an incredibly close approximation to the actual factorial value. So it's a powerful tool for mathematicians and computer scientists who need to work with large factorials. This deep dive has already been packed with information, and we've only just scratched the surface. Yeah. Before we wrap up our exploration of factorials, I want to give you a glimpse of some related concepts that build upon the idea of the factorials. Think of them as the extended factorial family. I'm intrigued. Tell us about these factorial cousins. Okay. So one interesting relative is the double factorials denoted by N. It's similar to the regular factorial, but you only multiply the odd or even numbers up to N, depending on whether N itself is odd or even. So 7 would be 7 times 5 times 3 times 1, and 8 would be 8 times 6 times 4 times 2. That's exactly right. And they have their own set of applications, particularly in combinatorics and probability. Okay. Then we have falling factorials, which are products of successively decreasing numbers, but not necessarily all the way down to 1. Okay. Falling factorials sound like they could be useful for counting scenarios where you have a limited number of choices. You're catching on quickly. Next we have primorials. As the name suggests, you multiply only the prime numbers up to a given N. For example, the primorial of 7 would be 2 times 3 times 5 times 7. So primorials capture the essence of prime factorization in a single value. Precisely. And then we can't forget subfactorials, which deal with the number of derangements, arrangements where nothing ends up in its original spot, and superfactorials, which take things a step further by multiplying consecutive factorials together. Wow, it's like a whole family reunion of factorial concepts. But perhaps the most fascinating relative of all is the gamma function. Oh yeah. It's a continuous function that extends the idea of the factorial to complex numbers. The gamma function is a bit of a celebrity in the maths world. I know it's a generalization of the factorial,
