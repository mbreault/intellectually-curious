## Description

An introduction to A000220, counting asymmetric (identity) trees with n nodes. We unpack what symmetry means for trees, why the first nonzero term appears at n = 7, and how the sequence connects to the broader family of tree counts via generating functions. We explore the role of the rooted-tree generating function A004111, the subtraction of symmetry contributions, and the resulting asymptotic growth a(n) ~ c d^n / n^52 with d â‰ˆ 2.5175 and c â‰ˆ 0.3. We also examine practical Maple/Mathematica snippets, and place A000220 in context with related sequences A000005, A000055, A000081, and A000411, along with key references for deeper study.

## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. Now for many of you listening, especially if you're studying number theory, the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, is, well, it's indispensable, isn't it? Absolutely, a treasure trove. And we're continuing our journey through it today. We're zoning in on one particular sequence, A000220. Ah, yes, A000220. This one counts the number of asymmetric trees with n nodes. Sometimes they're also called identity trees. Asymmetric identity trees. Okay, so our mission for this deep dive then is to really get a feel for this sequence. What exactly is an asymmetric tree? And why should number theory students pay attention to it? Good question. So the core idea here is about symmetry, or rather the lack of it. Right. An asymmetric tree is one where there are no non-trivial ways to map it onto itself, no symmetries. Okay, map it onto itself. What does that mean in practical terms if you're visualizing it? Imagine you have the tree structure drawn out. If you can flip it or rotate a part of it or swap some identical looking branches around and it still looks exactly the same as before. Well, that tree has symmetry. Gotcha. An asymmetric or identity tree is one where the only way to map it onto itself and have it look the same is the trivial way, just leaving every single node exactly where it started. Nothing moves. So fundamentally unique in its structure, you could say. Precisely. No internal repeating patterns or possibilities for a symmetrical rearrangement. Okay, that makes sense. Now let's look at the sequence itself. The OEIS lists the terms starting 1, then 0, 0, 0, 0, then suddenly 1, 1, 3, 6, 15. Wow, that's quite a start. What's going on with all those initial zeros? Yeah, that's often the first thing people notice. It tells us something quite interesting. For trees with just 2, 3, 4, 5, or even 6 nodes, it's actually impossible to construct one that doesn't have some kind of symmetry. Any arrangement you make will have some non-trivial automorphism. Really? So you need a certain minimum complexity before asymmetry is even possible. Exactly. It's not until you get to n is 7 nodes that you can finally build a tree structure that avoids all symmetries. And for n 7, there's only one way to do it. And then just one for n 08 as well before it starts climbing. 3, 6, 15. It looks like it grows pretty fast after that. It does. The number of ways to make these unique asymmetric structures increases quite rapidly as you add more nodes. So the fact that asymmetry only emerges at n 7, does that hint at something fundamental about how trees are built? Like smaller configurations just naturally fall into symmetrical patterns? I think that's a fair way to put it. With fewer nodes, the connection possibilities are more constrained. And those constraints often, well, force some kind of symmetry. It's like building with only a very few identical blocks. You tend to make balanced shapes. More nodes give you more freedom to create something irregular. Okay, now let's connect this to the bigger picture. We're talking about counting trees, which feels like combinatorics or graph theory. Where does the number theory angle come in? Why is this relevant for our audience? Well, several reasons. First, the act of counting combinatorial objects, especially fundamental ones like trees, often generates integer sequences with really fascinating number theoretic properties. Second, the tools we use to analyze these counts, things like generating functions, asymptotic formulas, these are powerful techniques shared between combinatorics and number theory. Studying A000220 is a great case study in applying these tools. Speaking of tools, the OEIS entry mentions a generating function for this sequence. It looks like ax minus a squared of x over 2 minus a of x squared over 2. Here, ax is the generating function for rooted trees, sequence A004111. That seems dense. It does look a bit technical, but the idea behind it is actually quite elegant. Think of ax as like a catalog holding the counts for all rooted trees. The formula then systematically subtracts the parts that correspond to symmetrical trees. The a squared term, a by 2, 2, that deals with symmetries where a tree might be composed of two identical subtrees branching off the root. Like mirror images attached. Sort of, yeah. And the a by 2, 2 term handles cases involving a different kind of internal symmetry. By subtracting these symmetry contributions from the total count of rooted trees, what's left is the generating function purely for the asymmetric ones. So it's like refining the count by filtering out the symmetrical cases using this generating function algebra. Exactly. It's a very powerful concept in enumeration. And then there's an asymptotic formula mentioned. An is approximately c times d to the power of n divided by n to the power of 52, where d is about 2.5175 and c is around 0.3. What does that tell us? So calculating the exact number gets incredibly hard for large n. The asymptotic formula gives you a really good approximation of how many asymmetric trees there are when n is big. And what does the form tell us? That d to the n looks exponential. It tells us the growth is roughly exponential, that dn term dominates. So the number shoots up very fast, but it's slightly tempered, slightly slowed down by that n to the 52 factor in the denominator. It's not pure exponential growth, but something closely related. So it gives us a handle on the long-term behavior, the growth rate. Precisely. Essential for understanding the scale of these combinatorial quantities. The OEIS entry also includes little code snippets from Maple and Mathematica. Why is that useful to see alongside the math? It underscores that this isn't just theoretical. These sequences can be computed. It shows you how, algorithmically, you could generate these numbers yourself. It lets students or researchers verify the sequence, explore it computationally, maybe look for patterns. It bridges theory and practice. Makes sense. Now, the cross-reps section in OEIS is always interesting. It links A000005, which is the number of all free trees, and A000055, which is the number of all free trees, and A000081, the number of rooted trees. How do these links help? They place A000220 in context. Seeing it linked to the counts of all trees or all rooted trees helps you understand that counting asymmetric trees are asymmetric. Exactly, and compare growth rates, see how the properties differ. And the link to A000411, rooted trees, is obviously key because its generating function is used directly to find the one for A000220 as we just discussed. Exploring these cross-references gives you a much richer map of the territory. And finally, the references section points to some heavy hitters. Bergeron, Labelle, LaRue's book, Hariri's graph theory, Hariri and Palmer's graphical enumeration. What's the value of digging into those? Those are foundational texts. If you really want to understand the mathematical machinery behind counting trees, graph automorphisms, generating functions, asymptotic methods, the theory that underpins sequences like A000220, those are the places to go. They provide the rigorous definitions, theorems, and techniques. So the deep dive behind the deep dive, essentially. You could say that, yes. They also mention specific resources like Alois Heinz's table with more terms, which is great for numerical exploration, and E. Friedman's illustrations, which can help visualize these structures. There's even a reference to a paper on algorithms for counting trees, highlighting the computational aspect again. Okay, so let's try to wrap this up. A000220 counts these asymmetric or identity trees, the ones with absolutely no non-trivial symmetry. We only start seeing them from n is 7 onwards. That's the gist of it. Their enumeration connects combinatorics, graph theory, and number theory through the sequence properties and the methods used to study them, like generating functions and asymptotics. It's a really neat intersection. Okay, here's a final thought for you listening. We've talked about mathematical symmetry, or the lack thereof, but where else might this idea of fundamental uniqueness of irreducible asymmetry be important? That's a fascinating question to ponder. Could it relate to designing efficient, non-redundant networks? Or maybe even in chemistry, thinking about chiral molecules, molecules that aren't superimposable on their mirror image, a kind of asymmetry. Does counting these unique structures mathematically give us insights there? It certainly makes you think about how these abstract mathematical concepts might echo in very different domains. The lack of symmetry often implies unique properties. Definitely something to mull over. As always, check out the OEIS entry for A000220. Follow the links, explore the references. It's your getaway to digging deeper. Thank you for joining us on this deep dive.
