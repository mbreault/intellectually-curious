## Description

In May 1945, as Europe collapsed, an unlikely coalition formed at Castle Itter in Austria: American GIs, disillusioned German officers, and VIP French prisoners fighting side by side against the Waffen-SS. This episode traces how this improbable defense came together, who the players were, and what the sourcesâ€”from interviews and archives to modern historiesâ€”reveal about loyalty, courage, and the chaos at the warâ€™s very end.

## Transcript

Okay, let's dive in. Picture this. It's the very, very end of World War II in Europe, May 1945. Yeah, the whole Nazi regime is basically collapsing, utter chaos. Right, but you've still got these pockets of hardcore Waffen-SS fighting on fanatics, really. Absolutely. Loyal to the bitter end, refusing to surrender. And in the middle of all this, something truly bizarre happens. You get American GIs and German soldiers, Wehrmacht soldiers fighting together. Shoulder to shoulder, yeah. Not against each other, but against the SS. It sounds like something straight out of Hollywood, doesn't it? Almost unbelievable. It really does. A totally unique event, pretty much. And what's so fascinating isn't just that it happened, but, you know, why? What led to this temporary alliance? Exactly. And that's what we're digging into today, the Battle of Castle Itter. Our mission really is to understand how this happened, the people, their reasons, what the sources tell us. And we've got some interesting material to work with. We do. There's an interview with Stephen Harding. He wrote The Last Battle, a key book on this. We've got Wikipedia for background, a Reddit discussion with some different takes. Got it. Articles from the Chronicles of History and Beaches of Normandy Tours for more narrative. And even an academic piece, The Grave Diggers of France, looking specifically at the prisoners. That sounds like a good mix. So the setting, Castle Itter, we need to picture that first, right? Definitely. It's in the Austrian Tyrol. The proper old fortress dates back centuries, like the 13th century. Real castle. Yeah. But by the time our story starts, after Austria was annexed by Germany in 38, the SS had taken it over, turned it into a prison. And not just any prison. It was for high-profile French figures, wasn't it? VIP prisoners. Exactly. We're talking former prime ministers, Dalladier, Reynaud, top generals like Gamelin and Weygand, even Jean Borotra, the tennis star. Wow, a real collection of French leaders. And they were held there along with others. Yeah, the sources mention Eastern European prisoners too, basically used for forced labor. And that grave diggers article really gets into the, well, the complicated relationships between these French guys. Ah, right. Because they weren't all friends, were they? They had history. Yeah. Blame for France's defeat in 1940, political disagreements. For sure. Big disagreements. Republicans versus Patan supporters all crammed in together as another layer, you know. Definitely. So the big question hanging over all this is, how on earth did German Wehrmacht soldiers end up defending this castle alongside Americans and these French prisoners against the SS? It just, it seems impossible. Totally counterintuitive. So let's set the scene a bit wider. Late April, early May 1945, the Third Reich is just disintegrating. Hitler's dead, killed himself April 30th, Berlin's fallen. But like you said, pockets of SS are still fighting fiercely. And for the prisoners in Castle Itter, this wasn't necessarily good news, was it? They were in serious danger. Huge danger. The sources say the castle's SS commander, Sebastian Wimmer, had orders. Explicit orders to kill all the prisoners if the Allies got close. Imagine living under that threat day in, day out, knowing that liberation could actually mean execution. Terrible. So under that pressure, they tried to get word out. Desperate measures. Yeah. Two attempts we know about. First, a guy named Vonimir Kukovic, a Yugoslav prisoner working there as a handyman. He tried to get to Innsbruck. Brave move. Did he make it? We actually, we don't know what happened to him. It's unclear. Shows how risky it was. Absolutely. But the second attempt? That one worked. Andreas Krobach, he was a cook there, he managed to get to the nearby town, Virgil, and contacted the Austrian Resistance. Ah, okay. So that was the crucial link, the Resistance. Yes. And that's where Wehrmacht Major Josef Gang comes in. Sepp Gangl. Right. Tell us about him. He was a decorated German Army officer, but he'd become pretty disillusioned with the Nazis. Actually made contact with that same Austrian Resistance group in Virgil. So he was already sort of leaning away from the regime. Seems like it. But initially, the sources say he was hesitant about storming the castle himself. His unit was small, depleted, taking on the SS directly. It was a big risk. Understandable. He needed more firepower, more men. Exactly. And then something else happened at the castle around this time. Something pretty sinister. Oh. What was that? Edward Weider, the former commandant of Dachau Concentration Camp, showed up at Castle Itter. The Dachau commandant. Why was he there? It's not entirely clear, but he died there very soon after arriving. Suspicious circumstances, the sources say. Maybe suicide, maybe killed. Oh, okay. That definitely would have ramped up the tension and the fear. Absolutely. It paints this picture of total chaos and the breakdown of any kind of order. So after Weider's death, and with the main SS guards apparently having abandoned the castle itself, Gangl saw how vulnerable the prisoners were. The SS guards left. But weren't SS units still nearby? Yes, that's the key thing. The regular guards might have gone, but Waffen-SS units were definitely in the area and potentially heading towards the castle. So Gangl realized, okay, his small group isn't enough. So what did he do? He made the call. The only real option was to get help from the Americans who were advancing nearby. He headed for Kustine. Kustine. Okay, and who did he find there? He found the US 12th Armored Division, specifically First Lieutenant John Seeley Jr., Jack Lee. An American lieutenant. Okay. And Gangl, a German major, just walked up and asked for help. Pretty much. And this is where it gets even wilder. Lee hears the story. VIP French prisoners, abandoned castle, SS closing in. And he decides to act. He does. Gets his captain's okay, apparently, but it was still a big decision. Technically, he probably didn't have direct orders for this kind of mission, but he felt he had to do something. gutsy move. What's amazing is how quickly Lee and Gangl started working together. An American and a German officer? Yeah, they actually went on a reconnaissance mission together, drove towards the castle to check it out. Former enemies, now allies planning a rescue. Assessing the danger, the castle's defenses. Exactly. And realizing they needed tanks, but the logistics were a nightmare. Ah, right. The sources mention the roads. Yeah, narrow Austrian mountain roads. And a weak bridge nearby. It meant Lee couldn't bring a huge force. So how many tanks actually made it? Just a few Shermans, it seems, including Lee's own tank, which had a nickname. The Satan Jenny? The Satan Jenny. Okay, so a very small force then. A few Americans, Gangl's handful of German soldiers. And Lee's tank crew. That was pretty much it. Heading into a castle, potentially about to be attacked by, well, who knew how many SS. So they get to the castle, this mixed group of defenders. What happens then? They have to set up defenses quickly. Around the main keep, the strongest part of the castle. And the French prisoners, were they just hiding? That's the amazing part. No, they refused to just hide in the cellar. These former prime ministers, generals, they actually wanted to fight. Seriously, they took up arms. Yes. Sources like the Beaches of Normandy Tours article, name them Reynaud, Gamalyn, Borotra, the tennis player, Della Rock, Clemenceau's son. They grabbed weapons and joined the defense line. Wow. That's incredible. Former politicians and generals fighting alongside American GIs and German soldiers against the SS. It's an unbelievable image, isn't it? That night, May 4th, the SS started probing their defenses. Small attacks, testing them out. Trying to find weaknesses. Did the defenders do anything to prepare? Yeah, they apparently put up some barbed wire, used whatever they could find. But there was also this hint of trouble. One source mentions maybe one of Gangl's men at the gatehouse deserted or betrayed them. Shows how fragile things were. Still underlying tension and mistrust, perhaps. Maybe. But the real fight came the next morning, May 5th. The main SS assault. Yes. The Chronicles of History says it was a pretty big force. Maybe 100, 150 Waffen-SS soldiers? That's a lot more than the defenders. Way more. And they brought heavy weapons. 20mm anti-aircraft guns and crucially an 88mm flak gun. An 88. Oof. That's devastating anti-tank firepower. Against a castle wall and tanks. Exactly. It started doing serious damage. And tragically, it knocked out Lee's tank, the Satan Jenny. Ah, their main heavy weapon gone. That's bad. Really bad. Gangl knew they were massively outgunned. He managed to get a call through to the Austrian resistance back in Virgil begging for help. Did they send anyone? They tried. But all they could muster was like two more Austrian resistance fighters and a teenage boy. Oh man. Not exactly the reinforcements they needed. Not at all. And then things got even worse. Their radio went dead. Cut off. Completely isolated. Surrounded, outnumbered, outgunned and no way to call for help. It
