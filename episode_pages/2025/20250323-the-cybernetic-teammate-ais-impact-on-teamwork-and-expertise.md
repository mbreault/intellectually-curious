## Description

In this Science Corner episode, we unpack two real-world studiesâ€”the Mollock blog post and Delacqua et al.'s field experiment at Procter & Gambleâ€”on AI as a teammate. We explore how generative AI reshapes teamwork, blends technical and commercial expertise, boosts quality and speed, and alters what it means to be an expert. We also discuss the emotional and organizational implications, from training to new career paths.

## Transcript

Welcome back to Science Corner. Glad to be here. You know, it's always a good time for a deep dive into the latest scientific findings with intellectually curious folks like yourself out there listening in. Absolutely. Today we're diving into something that sounds like it's straight out of science fiction. Oh, really? But it's quickly becoming our reality. Okay. We're talking about AI's impact on how we work together and even what it means to be an expert. I like it. So we're calling this deep dive, the cybernetic teammate, AI's impact on teamwork and expertise. Catchy. We've got two great sources to help us explore this. Okay. There's a really thought-provoking blog post by Ethan Mollock called The Cybernetic Teammate. And then there's a working paper by Fabrizio Delacqua and a team of researchers. And it has the same title, The Cybernetic Teammate, a field experiment on generative AI reshaping teamwork and expertise. Okay. You know, for years, we've mostly thought about AI as just a tool to help us get things done faster. Right. But these new powerful language models like ChatGPT are hinting at a much deeper integration where AI is actually a teammate. I see where you're going with this. Yeah. And what's great about these sources is that they don't just speculate about these possibilities. Oh, good. The working paper describes a large-scale study done at Procter & Gamble, the huge consumer goods company. Oh, wow. Yeah, they got to observe how real professionals working on real product development challenges interact with AI. Very cool. Our mission today is to unpack this research and understand how AI is not only affecting individual work, but also changing team dynamics and our understanding of what it means to be an expert. We want to see if AI can really be a teammate and what that means for the future of collaboration. Makes sense. So where do we start? Well, let's start with the main question the researchers wanted to answer. They wanted to go beyond AI just boosting productivity. I see. They asked if AI could provide those benefits we typically associate with a good human team. Right. You know, better results, combining different skills and knowledge. And even those intangible but important social and motivational aspects of teamwork, could AI really step into that space? That's a great question. And to find out, they designed a really ambitious experiment at Procter & Gamble. Okay. They had 776 professionals at P&G participate from commercial roles and technical R&D. Wow. And these weren't just entry-level employees either. Many had over 10 years of experience at the company. Really? Yeah. And what's really cool is that they were working on real product development challenges for brands they were already familiar with, like baby care, oral hygiene, all kinds of things. Okay, so like real-world stuff. Yeah, so the stakes were real. How did they structure the experiment? It was a really well-thought-out design. They had individuals work alone or in teams of two. Okay. And those teams had one R&D person and one commercial person. Makes sense. And then within each of those setups, half the groups got to use some of the most advanced AI models available, either GPT-4 or GPT-4. Right. And the other half worked without AI. The people using AI were given training and a set of prompts to help them get started. That makes sense. And the best part? What? The best ideas that came out of this experiment were actually submitted to P&G management to potentially be implemented. Oh, wow. So this wasn't just some theoretical exercise. Yeah, this was the real deal. So what did they find? Well, first off, they confirmed something we kind of already know. What's that? Teams working together, even without AI, performed better than individuals working alone. Uh-huh, the power of teamwork. Right. So how much better did the teams do? The teams showed an improvement of about 0.24 standard deviations. Okay. And standard deviation is a way to measure how spread out the results are. So a higher number means a bigger difference in performance. So that's a pretty decent improvement for the teams. Yes, but here's where it gets really interesting. Okay, I'm listening. Individuals who had access to AI actually performed just as well as those two-person teams that didn't have AI. Wow. They saw a 0.37 standard deviation improvement. So one person with AI could basically match a team of two experienced professionals. That's what the data suggests, yeah. That's pretty incredible. What happened when teams had AI? That combination was the most powerful. Really? Teams with AI achieved the best performance overall. Interesting. They saw a 0.39 standard deviation improvement. Okay, so slightly better than individuals with AI. But more importantly, they were much more likely to come up with what the researchers considered top-tier solutions, the ones that ranked in the top 10% for quality. So it's not just about doing better. It's about reaching a higher level of quality. All right, makes sense. And these AI-enabled groups, both individuals and teams, were also much faster, completing their tasks 12% to 16% quicker than those without AI. Wow. And their solutions were more thorough, longer, and more detailed. So AI is boosting quality and efficiency. Exactly. Now another key part of teamwork is sharing different kinds of expertise. Right. Did AI affect that? It did. How so? AI seemed to blur the lines between different areas of expertise. Really? Without AI, R&D people focused more on technical stuff in their solutions, and commercial people focused on the market. Right, that's their specialty. Yeah, in teams without AI, they achieved a more balanced approach by talking to each other and sharing their perspectives. Makes sense. But when AI was involved, things changed. How so? Both R&D and commercial professionals, individuals and teams, started to include both technical and commercial elements in their solutions more consistently. So the AI helped them think outside of their usual expertise. Yeah, you could say that. And this was especially true for less experienced professionals. Oh, interesting. Without AI, they didn't perform as well. That makes sense. But with AI, their performance improved a lot, almost to the level of teams with experienced members. Wow. So AI is helping them bridge the knowledge gap. Exactly. So AI is not only improving performance and blending expertise, but it's also democratizing expertise. Agreed. Allowing a wider range of employees to contribute to specialized tasks. Yeah, this has huge implications for how companies develop talent and structure their teams. Absolutely. Now let's talk about the emotional experience of working with AI. Did the study find anything there? This is a really interesting find. Yeah. We often hear that more technology, especially AI, can make work less satisfying and more stressful. Uh-huh. But this study found the opposite. Interesting. People who worked with AI actually reported feeling more positive emotions like excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. Wow. And they felt less negative emotions like anxiety and frustration compared to those who didn't use AI. That's surprising. Why do you think that is? Well, the researchers think it might be because of how these AI models interact with us. Okay. Particularly their language-based interface. I'm great, huh? It's not like using a regular tool. It feels more like having a helpful assistant. Interesting. And get this. Individuals using AI reported feeling as good or even better than those working in human teams. So AI is fulfilling that supportive role of a teammate. It seems like it. So AI is boosting performance, blending expertise, and making people feel better about their work. Yes. This brings us to the idea of the cybernetic teammate. What's the main point here? The researchers say we should stop thinking of AI just as software. Okay. Or just as a tool to help individuals. We should start thinking of AI as teammate. So what does that mean for how companies operate? It means we need to rethink how we structure teams. Okay. Like the best size and makeup of a team. Right. Training programs should teach people how to collaborate with AI. Uh-huh. And those boundaries between different departments could become less rigid. I see. This idea that AI can make expertise more accessible means more employees could contribute to specialized tasks. And that could lead to new career paths. Exactly. This could fundamentally change how we work, how we work together, and even how we manage people. Absolutely. This is a pretty big shift. Were there any other interesting findings in their research? Yeah, a few things. They found that both individuals and teams using AI were more likely to come up with top-tier solutions. No. Ones that ranked in the top 10% for quality. Okay. But here's the funny thing. Even though they performed better, the people using AI were actually less confident that their solutions were that good. That's strange. Why do you think that is? Well, maybe they gave more credit to the AI and less to themselves. That's possible. Another interesting thing was about team dynamics. Okay. In teams without AI, their solutions often leaned heavily towards either the technical or the commercial side, depending on who was more dominant in the conversation. Right. But teams with AI showed a much more balanced approach. Interesting. So AI helped to even things out and make sure both perspectives were considered. So AI is fostering a more balanced collaboration. Yeah, you could say that. What about how people actually used the AI? Well, they found two main approaches. Okay. Some people relied heavily on what the AI generated. They used a lot of AI content in their final solutions. Okay. But others used AI more for brainstorming and refining their own ideas. So they used less AI content overall. It seems like people are finding different ways to work with AI. Exactly. Some see it as a creator, while others see it as a thought partner. That's a good way to put it. Did they look at how similar the solutions
