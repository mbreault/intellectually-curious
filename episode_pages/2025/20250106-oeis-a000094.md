## Transcript

Welcome back everyone to another deep dive into the OEIS. Always fun to be back. The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for those just joining us. That's right. And today we are going to be looking at sequence A000094. Okay. Which is titled the number of trees of diameter four. Sounds a little intimidating but it's actually pretty cool. It's a bit abstract at first glance, I'll grant you that. But yeah, it's a really interesting one. Yeah. So before we get into the actual sequence. Right. Could you just remind us what trees and diameter actually mean like in this mathematical context? Yeah, so when we talk about trees, we're not talking about like the oak tree outside. Right, that's what I think of immediately. Yeah, we're talking about trees in graph theory. Okay. And a tree in this sense is a network that has a kind of branching structure to it. Okay. So think of it like a family tree. Okay. But without any loops or like weird marriages between cousins. Gotcha. It's just a simple branching structure with points connected by lines. So no complicated family reunions. Yeah, no complicated family reunions in graph theory trees. Okay, and then what about diameter? So the diameter of a tree is the longest path that you can find between any two points on that tree. Okay. It's like measuring the widest point of the tree if you were to kind of lay it out flat. I see. So in this sequence, A00094, we're looking at trees where that longest path involves exactly four points. Got it. So the diameter is four. Okay, so we're dealing with a very, very specific structure of tree. Yeah, a very specific type of tree. And this sequence is telling us how many of these trees exist. Right. As we increase like the total number of points on the tree. Exactly. Gotcha. Okay. So let's actually look at some numbers now. Sure. What are the first few terms of A00094? So the sequence begins with 000012814 and it continues on from there. Okay, so it starts with a bunch of zeros, which kind of makes sense, right? Yeah, it makes perfect sense because we need at least five points to even have a diameter of four. Right, you can't even have that structure with less than that. Exactly. Those first four zeros are telling us there are no trees with a diameter of four. Okay. If you have one, two, three, or four points, then we get to that first non-zero term one. Yeah. This means there's only one possible tree with five points that has a diameter of four. And then the sequence grows from there. Yeah. As we add more points, there are more and more ways to create these trees. Okay, so we've got these numbers. Right. They represent specific tree structures. Yeah. But what makes this sequence particularly interesting? So the really cool thing about the OEIS is that it's not just about listing these numbers. Right. It's about finding out what they mean. Yeah. And how they connect to other mathematical concepts. And if we look at the comments for A00094, we discover some pretty fascinating connections. Okay, lay it on me. I'm intrigued. So one way to think about the sequence is through the concept of partitions. Partitions as in like dividing things up. Exactly. Imagine you have like a plate of cookies, six cookies. A partition of six is just a way to break those six cookies into smaller groups that all add up to six. Okay, I'm following. So you could have a group of three cookies and another group of three or a group of four and a group of two. Yeah. And so on and so forth. Okay, so what do cookies have to do with trees? Well, according to the OEIS, A00094 also represents the number of ways to partition the number N minus one with at least two groups that have a size of two or larger. Okay, hold on. So instead of counting trees, we're counting ways to divide up cookies. Right. But with a specific rule about like the sizes of the groups? Exactly. It's not just any way to divide up the cookies. It has to follow that rule. Okay. And this is where the connection gets really cool. Right. It means there's a link between these abstract tree structures and the ways we can divide things up into groups. Okay. For example, if we look at a seven, which is five in our sequence, that means there are five ways to partition six. Okay, so N minus one. Right. With at least two groups of size two or larger. Okay, let me think about this for a second. Okay. So we need five ways to break down the number six, making sure that at least two of those groups have two or more. Yeah. Okay, I think I got it. Okay, what do you got? Would those partitions be four, two, then three, three, three, two, one, and then two, two, two, and two, two, one, one? That's exactly right. You got all five of them. Wow. Okay. Yeah. So we've gone from counting trees to counting cookies, essentially. And they're linked. And somehow they're linked, yeah. Yeah, it's really fascinating. That's amazing. And we're just getting started. Believe it or not, there are even more ways to interpret this sequence. Oh, wow. Which we'll explore in part two. I can't wait. It's so cool how these numbers can point to so many different concepts. Yeah, it really is. And so everyone's detuned because this deep dive is about to get even deeper. That's right. Okay, so we saw how this sequence, 000094, connects trees of a certain diameter to the world of partitions, which I'm still a little blown away by, to be honest. It is, it's a pretty remarkable connection. Yeah. And it gets even deeper when you consider that there are multiple ways to interpret this sequence through partitions. Wait, really? So we just saw how it relates to partitions with at least two groups of size two or larger. Right. Are you telling me there's like another way to look at it through partitions? Yeah, there's another interpretation that the OEIS comments point to. Okay. It says that A000094 also represents the number of ways to partition N minus one, where the largest group is at least two bigger than the smallest group. Okay, so instead of like focusing on having at least two big groups, we're now looking at the difference between the largest and smallest piece of the partition. Yeah, you got it. Okay. And if we go back to our example of a seven, which equals five, we can see how this rule works. Okay. The five partitions of six that fit this criterion are 5, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, and 3, 1, 1, 1. Ah, okay. I see. So in each of those partitions, the biggest number is at least two greater than the smallest number. Exactly. But wait a minute. Those are different partitions than the ones we saw before. Right. How can both rules lead to the same sequence, A000094? That's the beauty of it. Yeah. Even though the rules for creating the partitions are different, they both result in the same count for each value of N. So it's like two paths leading to the same destination. Exactly. Yeah, it's like a hidden connection. Yeah, that's fascinating. Between these two seemingly separate ways of partitioning numbers. Does the OEIS give us any clues as to why these different partition rules are connected? Actually, there's a formula in the OEIS entry that sheds some light on this connection. Okay. It says A N plus 1 equals A000041 N minus N for N greater than 0. Hold on. Another sequence. Another sequence. Yeah, what's A000041? So A000041 is another fundamental sequence in the OEIS. Okay. And it simply counts the total number of partitions of a number without any restrictions. So you could think of it as like the parent sequence. Okay. Counting all the possible partitions. Gotcha. While A000094 is kind of like a child sequence that focuses on specific types of partitions. Okay, I see. I see the bigger picture now. Yeah. So this formula is telling us that we can get the next term in our tree sequence, A000094, by looking at the corresponding term in like the parent partition sequence, A000041. Exactly. And then doing a little math. Yeah, and that connection reveals something really intriguing about the relationship between trees and partitions. Okay. The way we arrange those points in a tree with a diameter of four is somehow related to the ways we can break down numbers into smaller parts. So you're saying that the way a family tree branches out is mathematically connected to how we split up, say, a pizza? In a way, yeah. That's kind of mind-blowing. It's pretty cool. I don't fully understand how, but it's definitely making me think. Yeah. But this all seems very theoretical. Right. Are there any real-world applications of this sequence or the concepts it embodies? That's a great question. Yeah. And while A000094 might seem abstract on the surface, the ideas of trees and partitions do have applications in various fields. Oh, like what? Give me some examples. Okay, well, think about computer science. Okay. Trees are essential for data structures and algorithms. Right. For example, when a computer searches through a large database, it often uses a tree-like structure to find information quickly and efficiently. Okay, I see how that would work. And the idea of partitions comes up in optimization problems, where you need to divide resources or tasks in the best possible way. Gotcha. What about outside of, like, the digital
