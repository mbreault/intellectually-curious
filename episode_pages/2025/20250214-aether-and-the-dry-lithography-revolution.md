## Description

Chasing ever-smaller chips requires new approaches beyond wet resists. In this episode, we dive into LAM Research's Aetherâ€”an all-dry resist process that uses vapor deposition and EUV lithography to pattern features at nanometer scales, delivering higher yields, lower material usage, and energy savings. We're joined by real-world adopters like memory manufacturers and IBM, plus insights from EMEKâ€™s qualification at the 2-nm node. We'll unpack the science, the business, and what this could mean for Moore's Lawâ€”and for the future of sustainable semiconductor manufacturing.

## Transcript

Have you ever thought about like how much tech we managed to fit onto these super tiny computer chips? It's incredible, isn't it? We're talking like features smaller than the human hair. Oh, yeah. And they just keep getting smaller. It's like trying to fit a whole library onto a pinhead. But at some point you hit a limit on how small you can go. Absolutely. As you keep shrinking these features, what we call pitch size down to like the nanometer scale, you start to run into some real challenges for manufacturers. So what's the problem exactly? Well... Like why can't we just keep making things smaller with the same old techniques? Yeah, it's... The problem is with the way that we create these like intricate patterns on the chips. Traditionally we've used these wet resist processes. It's like using a teeny tiny dropper to put ink exactly where you need it. And now shrink that drop down to basically nothing and try to place it with atomic precision. That sounds like a total nightmare. Yeah. Especially when you're talking about like billions of these tiny features on a single chip. Yeah, and it gets even more complicated as those features shrink. Right. The tools and materials that we've been using just aren't really up to the task. Okay. They lack the precision and the consistency that we need at these just mind-bogglingly small scales. So what's the solution? Do we just kind of hit a wall and say, okay, chips can't get any better than this? Well, that's where things get really, really interesting. Okay. This is where LAM Research comes in, and their really groundbreaking dry resist technology, Aether. Okay. And the kicker, it might be the key to keeping Moore's law alive. Moore's law? Yeah. The whole idea that like computing power doubles every couple of years? Right. I mean, that's driven so much of the progress we've seen. Yeah. From smartphones to the internet and everything in between. Exactly. But I thought we were like getting close to the limits of Moore's law. We may have been if we had stuck with the old ways. Right. But Aether, with its very radical dry resist approach, could change all of that. Hold on, back up for a second. Okay. Dry resist, that sounds kind of counterintuitive. Yeah. Isn't semiconductor manufacturing all about like etching and using chemicals and liquids? You're right. Traditionally it has been, but Aether flips the script. Instead of like liquid ink and a dropper, imagine using like a vaporized material and a stencil to create these super precise patterns. It's a real game changer, and it's much more environmentally friendly too. Oh, wow. Okay. We'll get into the sustainability aspect a bit later. Okay. Color me intrigued. All right. So Aether is a dry process. It is. You're using vapors to create these tiny patterns. Yeah. But how does that actually work? I mean, we're talking about things on an atomic scale here. It is. How do you even control something that small? It is mind boggling, right? And to be honest, the actual science behind it is really complex. I bet. But let's see if we can simplify it a little. Instead of a liquid resist that needs to be developed and rinsed away, Aether uses this very special dry resist material that's deposited onto the chip wafer as a vapor. Okay. Then using EUV lithography. EUV? Yes. That's a extreme ultraviolet lithography, right? Right, right. So it's basically like using this super powered laser to create the pattern. Exactly. It's like using a laser pointer to draw a picture. Okay. But this pointer is using light with a much shorter wavelength. Okay. Which allows us to create these features that are unbelievably small. All right. So we've got the Aether vapor deposited on the wafer. Right. And then this EUV laser edges the patterns. What happens next? So after the EV exposure, there's a baking process that basically solidifies the exposed areas of the dry resist. Okay. And then the unexposed parts are just removed. Gotcha. Leaving behind the really precise pattern we need for the chip circuitry. So no harsh chemicals. Nope. No messy liquids. No. Just a nice clean dry process. Yes. That sounds like a huge step forward. But is it really living up to the hype? I mean, has anyone actually used this to make real chips? Oh, absolutely. Okay. And that's where things get really exciting. Aether is already making waves in the industry. Really? Yeah. Who major players, you know? Okay. Like leading memory manufacturers are already using it in their production processes. Memory manufacturers? Yeah. That's a big deal. Right. That means it's not just some lab experiment. Yeah. It's actually being used to make like the chips that power our phones and computers. Exactly. So how is it performing in the real world? Pretty good. Is it really that much better than the old web process? Yeah. The results have been pretty impressive so far. One major manufacturer reported that... Oh, wow. After switching to Aether for their DRAM production, they saw a pretty significant increase in yield. Yield? Yeah. That's the number of working chips they get from each batch, right? That's right. So more chips with fewer defects. I bet that makes the bean counters happy. Yeah, they love it. Lower cost, more efficient production. Yep. But it's not just about saving money, is it? No. Aether's got that whole sustainability angle too. Right. Tell me more about that. Yeah, it's a really big win for the environment. Okay. Remember all those harsh chemicals and tons of water needed for the wet resist process? Yeah. With Aether, those are pretty much eliminated. Wow. We're talking about 5 to 10 times less raw material usage. Okay. And a significant reduction in energy consumption. That's huge. It's like they found a way to make chip manufacturing greener and more efficient at the same time. Yeah, it's pretty amazing. But let's be honest. Sometimes these new technologies sound a little too good to be true. Are there any downsides or like challenges with Aether? Well, it's still a relatively new technology. Okay. And there are always challenges when you're implementing something this groundbreaking. Right. You know, one challenge is that it requires like really specialized equipment and expertise. Okay. It's not something you could just plug and play into an existing factory. So there's like an investment cost involved. Yeah. And a learning curve for the industry. But that makes sense for something this cutting edge. Yeah. It's like switching from horses to cars, you know. Yeah. You need new infrastructure. People need to learn how to drive. Exactly. But let's get back to these amazing companies who are already using this stuff. You mentioned memory manufacturers. Who else is like jumping on the Aether bandwagon? Another big name is IBM. Oh, wow. They've been using Aether for some of their most advanced chip designs, specifically for a process called copper damascene. Okay. Man, you're just using big words to make me feel dumb. Sorry. What in the world is copper damascene? It's actually pretty fascinating. Imagine you're building like tiny skyscrapers on your chip. Okay. Copper damascene is kind of like building the intricate network of wires and connections that run between those skyscrapers, allowing them to communicate with each other. So it's like the wiring for a super tiny city on a chip. Pretty much, yeah. And Aether is helping IBM make those intricate connections even smaller and more efficient. Exactly. And IBM's seen some really amazing results. They've said that Aether is a key enabler for their most advanced chips. They're calling it like the best known process available today for creating these crucial connections. Okay, so we've got memory manufacturers and like tech giants like IBM raving about Aether. Yeah. Anyone else? Yeah, there is. I feel like there's got to be more to this story. You're right. EMEK, a leading research institute in nanoelectronics, has also given Aether their stamp of approval. Oh, wow. They've qualified Aether for use in creating the back end of line or bail logic in chips at the 2 nanometer node and beyond. Bail logic. Yeah. 2 nanometers. Okay, my brain is officially overloaded. Sorry. Break that down for me. Okay. What exactly is bail logic and why is that 2 nanometer thing so important? Okay, so think of it this way. The transistors are like the brains of the chip doing the actual calculations. Okay. The bail is kind of like the nervous system, you know? Okay. Connecting all those brains together and allowing them to communicate and work in sync. Right. And 2 nanometers? Yeah. Well, that's just insanely small. Yeah. We're talking about features that are literally just a few atoms wide. Wow. Incredible. Okay, so Aether's not just helping to create like the brains of the chip. It's also building the nervous system that connects everything together. Right. At the incredibly tiny scale. Yeah, it's like It's like creating a microscopic superhighway system inside the chip. That's a great analogy, yeah. Right. And EMEK's qualification is a big deal. Yeah. Because it means Aether has like proven its capability to meet these incredibly demanding requirements. Wow. For these next generation chips. It's amazing to think that this dry process is pushing the limits of what's possible in chip manufacturing. Yeah. And at the same time, it's actually better for the environment. Mm-hmm. It's not something you hear every day. No. This Aether technology really does sound revolutionary. It is revolutionary. And as with any revolution, there will be ripple effects. Ooh, ripple effects. I like where this is going. Yeah. Tell me more. So we've been talking about how Aether is
