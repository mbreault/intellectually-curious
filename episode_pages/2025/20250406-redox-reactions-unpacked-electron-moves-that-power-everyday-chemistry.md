## Transcript

Welcome back to the deep dive, everybody. Today we're tackling a pretty fundamental concept in chemistry. One that has some pretty fascinating implications for our daily lives and just the world in general. We're going to be talking about redox reactions. That's right. Reduction and oxidation reactions. Redox. Redox reactions. Now, if you're anything like me, maybe this brings back some hazy memories of high school chemistry class, right? But trust me, this is a deep dive worth taking because these reactions are happening all around us constantly and you may not even realize it. So, Doc, what's the mission for us today in this deep dive? Well, what we want to try to do today is to give you, the listener, a really clear picture of what exactly these reactions entail. Okay. You know, kind of the nuts and bolts of it. And then more importantly, why they are so significant. Right. Both in the natural world and in a lot of the technologies that we rely on every day. So we've got a range of materials we're going to draw on. Everything from, you know, basic scientific overviews of redox reactions to some of the more intricate chemical principles that underlie them. Right. So we're really excited to kind of share the key takeaways from all of that with you. Yeah. You know, and to bring it down to earth right away, just to kind of give people an idea. I mean, think about something as simple as a piece of magnesium reacting with the air. Right. You know, if you've ever seen that, like the, I don't know, the brilliant flash that it produces as it forms magnesium oxide. Yes. You know, that seemingly simple, you know, kind of event is a perfect example of a redox reaction in action. So at its most basic level, like what's actually going on there? So at its core, a redox reaction involves the movement of electrons between different substances. Okay. So the term redox itself is a combination, right? Okay. Of reduction and oxidation. Right. And this is a point where the terminology can get a little bit tricky. Sure. Because reduction refers to the gaining of electrons by a substance. Okay. Whereas oxidation refers to the loss. Gotcha. So reduction is gain and oxidation is loss. Right. Easy to get it flipped around in your head? It is. It is. I remember a way that I always remembered it was oil rig. Does that ring a bell? Absolutely. Oil rig is a very common mnemonic device. Oxidation is loss. Right. Reduction is gain. So it's a really simple but effective way to keep those definitions straight in your mind. Yeah. Because this transfer of electrons is really the central event that happens in every redox reaction. Okay. So we've got this movement of electrons happening. Yes. How do scientists keep track of that? I mean, especially when you're dealing with, you know, molecules where atoms are sharing electrons instead of completely exchanging them like they would in an ionic bond. Right. Right. So that's where the concept of oxidation states comes in. Okay. Sometimes called oxidation numbers. Okay. And you can think of it as a way to sort of, you know, it's a bookkeeping system. Okay. That we use to keep track of how the electrons are distributed within a compound. Gotcha. So it allows us to look at an atom even within a covalent bond. Right. Where the electrons aren't, you know, being fully exchanged. Right. It allows us to see has that atom effectively gained electrons. Yeah. Or effectively lost electrons. Okay. Even though it's in this shared bond. That makes sense. That's a really good way to think about it, kind of this tracking system. Right. So how do we actually assign these oxidation states to atoms? Right. Are there certain rules? Yes, there are a set of rules. Okay. And they're pretty logical when you think about them. Okay. So the first rule is that any element that's in its pure elemental form, whether it's a single atom like magnesium, mrag, or a molecule made of two identical atoms like oxygen gas, O2, or even a larger molecule like sulfur S8, all of those have an oxidation state of zero. Okay. And that's because in a pure element, there's no difference in electronegativity. So no one atom is pulling the electrons more strongly than another. So if it's all the same atom, everything's kind of neutral. Exactly. Gotcha. What happens if an atom gains or loses electrons to become an ion? So for ions that consist of just a single atom, these are called monatomic ions, the oxidation state is simply equal to the electrical charge of the ion. Gotcha. So for instance, if you have like iron 2 chloride, FeCl2, the iron ion in that Fe plus has an oxidation state of plus 2. Okay. Similarly, in sodium chloride, NaCl, table salt, the chloride ion, Cl, has an oxidation state of minus 1. Gotcha. So pure elements are 0 and single atom ions reflect their charge. That's right. Okay. So what about when you've got atoms bonded together to form molecules though? Right. So there's a few more key guidelines to keep in mind. Okay. In most compounds, oxygen has an oxidation state of minus 2. Okay. Now there are some exceptions to that. Okay. Like in peroxides. Or when oxygen's bonded with fluorine, which is very electronegative. Sure. But generally minus 2. Gotcha. Hydrogen, when it's bonded to non-metals, typically has an oxidation state of plus 1. Okay. Interestingly, when hydrogen bonds with a metal, it can actually have an oxidation state of minus 1. Oh, wow. And those are called metal hydrides. Okay. But usually plus 1. And speaking of electronegativity, fluorine always exhibits an oxidation state of minus 1 in its compounds. Okay. So generally oxygen is minus 2, hydrogen is plus 1 when it's with a non-metal, and fluorine is always minus 1. What about the other elements in a compound? Right. So the final crucial rule is that for any neutral compound, if you add up all the oxidation states of all the atoms that are present, the sum has to equal 0. Gotcha. And if you're dealing with a polyatomic ion, which is an ion that's made up of multiple atoms, the sum of the oxidation states has to equal the overall charge on that ion. Okay. Can you give us an example just to kind of drive that point home? Sure. So let's take water, H2O. Okay. So we know that hydrogen, when it's bonded to a non-metal like oxygen, is usually plus 1. Right. And there are two hydrogen atoms, so that gives us a total of plus 2 from the hydrogens. Right. Now, since a water molecule is neutral overall, the oxidation state of that single oxygen atom has to be minus 2 to make the overall charge 0. Gotcha. So plus 2 plus minus 2 equals 0. Right. Exactly. Let's look at a polyatomic ion. How about sulfate, SO42? Okay. So oxygen typically has an oxidation state of minus 2. Right. And there are four oxygen atoms. Okay. So that gives us a total of minus 8 from the oxygens. Right. Now, the overall charge on the sulfate ion is minus 2. So the oxidation state of the sulfur atom has to be plus 6 because plus 6 plus minus 8 equals minus 2. Right. Right. It's like, I like that. It's like a bookkeeping system. It is. You're keeping track of everything to make sure it all balances out in the end. Exactly. So now that we can assign these oxidation states, how does that help us understand oxidation and reduction more clearly? Okay. So now we can actually define oxidation and reduction in terms of those oxidation states. Gotcha. So if during a chemical reaction, the oxidation number of an atom increases, that means that atom has undergone oxidation. Okay. It's effectively lost electrons. Okay. Conversely, if the oxidation number of an atom decreases during a reaction, that atom has been reduced. Okay. It's gained electrons. Gotcha. So let's go back to our magnesium and oxygen example from the beginning. Okay. The magnesium went from an oxidation state of zero as just the pure element to plus 2 in magnesium oxide. Yes. So that's an increase, meaning it was oxidized. It was oxidized. And then oxygen went from zero as O2 to minus 2 in magnesium oxide. So decrease, meaning it was reduced. Precisely. Okay. And this leads us to the concepts of oxidizing and reducing agents. Okay. Which can also be a little tricky to keep straight. So the substance that causes another substance to be oxidized. Okay. So it's the substance that's accepting the electrons. Okay. And therefore being reduced itself is known as the oxidizing agent. The oxidizing agent. Okay. And conversely, the substance that causes another substance to be reduced. Okay. So it's the substance that is donating the electrons. Right. And thereby being oxidized itself. Okay. Is known as the reducing agent. The reducing agent. Okay. So in that magnesium oxide reaction then. Yes. Because the magnesium is oxidized. Right. That means it's acting as the reducing agent by giving its electrons to the oxygen. Exactly. And because the oxygen is being reduced, it's acting as the oxidizing agent because it's accepting those electrons. That's right. Yeah. And in general, metals like magnesium tend to lose electrons easily. Okay. So they often act as good reducing agents. Gotcha. And non-metals like oxygen and fluorine, they tend to gain electrons more easily. Okay. So they frequently serve as oxidizing agents. Okay. That
