## Description

In this episode, we synthesize McKinseyâ€™s The State of Aviation 2025 to map the health of the industry in 2024â€“2025, identify the six fundamentals that separate winners from the rest, and explain how capacity, demand, and ancillary revenue are reshaping profitability. Weâ€™ll unpack regional performance, the shift in low-cost vs. legacy dynamics, the role of reliability (OTP), and what looming headwindsâ€”like SAF costs and geopolitical uncertaintyâ€”mean for 2025. If you want a clear, data-driven shortcut to understanding aviationâ€™s future, this episode is for you.

## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today we're taking a close look at the aviation industry. That's right. Specifically where it stands in 2025 and where it might be headed next. Exactly. And our guide for this is a brand new McKinsey report, The State of Aviation 2025, just out this May. Yeah, it's a pretty comprehensive piece. It really digs into the financials, the challenges, the opportunities. It uses a lot of solid data. Right. And for you, the learner, our goal here is to pull up the key insights. We want to understand, you know, the industry's health, how business models are changing. Think low cost versus legacy guys. Plus how airlines sell to us now, that whole retailing piece and the need for better planning. And of course, this aircraft shortage everyone's talking about. They'll try to cut through the noise. Yeah, make it clear, make it engaging, give you that shortcut to understanding. Okay, so first things first, how healthy is the airline industry right now overall? Well, the report says 2024 was pretty decent actually. About 41% of airlines created positive economic value, which sounds maybe not amazing, but compare that to 2019 pre-pandemic. The industry lost something like $30 billion collectively then. Yeah. So yeah, big turnaround. That is a big swing, especially when you think about, well, the industry's long term profitability issues. Exactly. And that's the really interesting part. Historically, since at least 1996, the industry's return on invested capital, the ROIC. How well they use their money, basically. Right. It's generally been below what it costs them to get that capital, their WACC. But in 2023 and 2024, that gap between ROIC and WACC was the narrowest it's been. So closer to actually making a real profit consistently. Getting closer, yeah. It suggests some underlying improvements. But I guess that improvement isn't happening everywhere equally. No, definitely not. The report shows big regional differences. Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, they seem to be doing quite well. Asia Pacific, on the other hand, that's where most of the negative results were concentrated. So location matters a lot. And are there airlines that just seem to get it right year after year? The consistent winners? Yes, absolutely. McKinsey identified seven airlines that actually earned their cost of capital every year from 2015 to 2024, if you skip the main pandemic years. Wow, seven. And another 12 that did it for all but two of those years. So yeah, some airlines definitely have a formula that works consistently. We always hear about fuel prices driving everything in aviation. What's the report say about that link? Is it that direct? It's actually maybe not as direct as people assume. The analysis suggests you can have good performance whether fuel prices are high or low. I mean, 2023 and 2024 fuel prices are nominally quite high, right? But the industry still managed decent ROIC overall. So it's not just fuel. Other things must be driving success more. Exactly. It seems other factors are really more important for profitability. So what are those factors then? What do the winners do differently? McKinsey boils it down to six key things. First, balancing capacity and demand really carefully. Don't fly empty planes. Don't leave money on the table. Makes sense. Second, getting good at ancillary revenue, bags, seat choices, all that extra stuff. Right, the add-ons. Third, building a reputation for being reliable. On-time performance matters. Hugely important for passengers. Fourth, offering unique routes, especially origin-destination pairs where they have an edge. Fifth, being really efficient with their assets, their planes, high capital productivity. Getting the most out of expensive investments. And sixth, just having a strong, healthy organization. Good culture, clear direction, motivated people. So the recent improvements we've seen, it's mostly because airlines got better at these six things. That seems to be the main driver, yeah. Better execution on the fundamentals. But there were also some big constraints on capacity in 2023 and 2024. Ah, okay. What caused that? Mainly fewer new planes being delivered. Deliveries were down 24% in 2023 and then 30% in 2024 compared to 2018 levels. Significant drops. Plus engine problems grounded a fair number of aircraft too, tightening things up even more. So airlines had to, what, just keep their older planes flying longer? Pretty much. They responded by, well, by extending leases 11% more lease extensions in 2024 than 2018. And yeah, holding on to older aircraft. The average fleet age actually went up. How much? From 9.7 years in 2018 to 11.3 years in 2024. Okay, noticeable. But are more planes coming soon? You hear about big orders? Yes, that's the good news. As of March 2025, the order books are near all-time highs. So that strongly suggests a wave of new aircraft should start arriving, easing those capacity pressures. Okay, so supply might ease up. But what about demand? Are there worries on that side? There are, yeah. The report points to a few potential headwinds. Lower GDP growth expected in places like Europe. Right, economy slows, travel might too. And the push for sustainable aviation fuels or SAFs. Good for the planet, but could raise ticket prices. Which might dampen demand a bit. Possibly. And then there's just general economic uncertainty, geopolitical stuff that can shake consumer and business confidence, make people pull back on travel spending. Let's talk about that ancillary revenue point again. It feels like it's become a huge part of the airline business now. Oh, absolutely massive. It went from maybe 5% of total sector revenue back in 2010 to around 15% in 2024. Wow, tripled. Yeah, and airlines are getting much smarter about it. More personalization, better timing on the offers, trying to tailor it to you. And loyalty programs, still a big deal. Huge deal, especially the co-branded credit cards, particularly in markets like the US where card usage and interchange fees are high. They really drive value and keep customers sticky. Makes sense. You build up miles, you stick with the airline. Exactly. Even if they aren't always the cheapest or most convenient for a specific trip. What about reliability, on-time performance or OTP? How much does that really affect the bottom line? There's a clear link in the research. Better OTP correlates with better financial results. And passengers care, 34% said reliable operations boost their loyalty. That's the third biggest factor after price and comfort. Interesting. How is OTP doing lately? Well, in the US it was 78% in 2024, which is better than, say, the year 2000, but actually down from a peak of 81% back in 2016. So room for improvement there for many. The report mentioned network privilege. What's that about? Oh, yeah. That's basically when an airline has a strong advantage on certain routes, certain origin destination pairs. Maybe they're the only direct flight or by far the most convenient option. So they can charge a bit more on those routes? Pretty much. They have more pricing power. And airlines with more of these privileged routes tend to have better ROIC. You'll often see this with hubs serving smaller secondary markets. And overall, are airlines getting better at using their capital, generating more revenue per dollar invested? Yes, definitely a positive trend there. In 2024, they generated $1.23 in revenue for every dollar invested capital. Back in 2000, it was only $1.90. So significantly more efficient over time. Right. Better asset utilization, better revenue management, all contributing. Okay, one last factor from that list of six. Organizational health. That sounds a bit fuzzier. How does that impact performance? It might sound fuzzy, but the correlation is strong. Airlines with clear direction, motivated employees, a real focus on the customer, they tend to have better ROIC. But are airlines generally good at this? Apparently not so much. The report found that a staggering 67% of the airlines they looked at were in the bottom quartile for organizational health compared to other industries. Ouch. So huge room for improvement internally for many airlines. Huge, especially around things like direction, motivation, and really understanding the external market and customer needs. So looking ahead just for the rest of 2025, what are the main clouds on the horizon? Key potential headwinds. Continued demand uncertainty, maybe recession risks lingering, and the chance of rising costs could be fuel again, could be labor, tariffs, that sort of thing. So yeah, cautious optimism maybe, but still lots of uncertainty. Okay, let's shift gears a bit. Let's talk about the low-cost carriers, the LCCs and ULCCs. Historically, they've kind of been the darlings, right? Better returns than the big legacy guys. Generally, yes. On a global scale, that's been the story. Better returns, faster growth. But things are changing, especially in North America. Oh, what's happening there? It's quite a reversal, actually. Recently, North America, legacy carriers have started outperforming the LCCs and ULCCs on ROIC. Really? Yeah, and the growth rates for the low-cost guys there are now actually trailing the legacy carriers. It's a pretty big shift from the historical pattern. Latin America is seeing a similar trend emerge, too. Wow, okay. So what's driving that change, particularly in North America? Why are legacy carriers suddenly doing better relative to the budget airlines? The report suggests three main things are going on. First, rising labor costs. That hits the low-cost carriers harder, proportionally, because labor is
