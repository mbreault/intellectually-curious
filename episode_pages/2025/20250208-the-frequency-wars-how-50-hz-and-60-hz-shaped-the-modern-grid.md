## Transcript

Welcome to today's deep dive. We're going to try to unpack the really fascinating history behind something you probably see every day. Two little numbers, 50 Hertz and 60 Hertz. You know those standard power frequencies that we use all around the world? Right. And trust me, there's way more to this story than you might think. We got some awesome academic papers and some really interesting historical articles to dig into today. Yeah, it really is amazing how these numbers that just kind of seem mundane and in the background actually have this whole backstory of technological breakthroughs and fierce competition and just global oddities. It's a really fascinating story. So to kick things off, let's go way back to the very beginning of AC power systems. Okay. And our sources are talking about this like wild west of frequencies. Yeah. Like there was 16 and 2 3rds Hertz, 133 and 1 3rd Hertz. Oh, wow. Can you imagine like living with that? I mean, can you imagine like trying to read a book under a 133 Hertz light bulb? Oh my gosh. It'd be like a strobe light. It's fascinating how we ended up with 50 and 60. It wasn't like a grand conspiracy or a single decision. It was really a gradual evolution that was shaped by, you know, the technology of the day, economic factors, and just the need to standardize as these power grids grew larger and larger. So one of our sources mentioned this pivotal moment. It's 1863, the first commercial use of AC power. Okay. It was in a lighthouse in France. Yeah. And they were using a 53 Hertz system. What was going on back then? So back then, the main electrical devices were arc lamps and some of the first electric motors. Right. And these things actually worked best on DC power or lower frequency AC power. But DC was tough to send over long distances, right? Yeah, you're exactly right. Direct current was really difficult and expensive to change the voltage of for efficient transmission over long distances. So that's where AC power starts to become really attractive. Especially with the invention of transformers. Exactly. Transformers were a game changer. And guess what? Transformers actually work better at higher frequencies. Oh, really? Yeah. So you've got like early lighting and motors wanting lower frequencies. Yeah. But then the transformers are pushing for these higher frequencies. It sounds like a real tough situation for those early engineers. Yeah, it definitely created some tension. And then the invention of incandescent light bulbs throws another wrench into the mix. Right, because I remember LEDs are pretty good. Yeah, LEDs are great. They can handle a wide range of frequencies. But those old incandescent bulbs, they actually worked better at higher frequencies. Oh, interesting. Yeah, it helped to reduce that annoying flicker you would get with lower frequencies. Okay, so now we have this three-way tug of war going on. It's like the lighting, the motors, and the transformers are all kind of fighting for their ideal frequency. Right. And then enters Nikola Tesla with his famous induction motor. Right. That really starts to tip the scales. Yeah, because those motors were pretty important for industry and everything, right? Absolutely. They quickly became essential and they happened to work best around that 50 to 60 hertz range. Okay, so it's starting to kind of narrow down a little bit. Yeah. Now things are starting to heat up. We've got two major players entering the scene. We got Westinghouse in the US and AEG over in Germany. Yeah. And they really shaped how this frequency battle played out. Right. It was a time of fierce competition. Yeah. Westinghouse was really focused on lighting, so they chose 60 hertz to minimize that flicker. Makes sense. They knew there were some issues with motors, but they believed that technology would eventually catch up. On the other side, AEG started with 40 hertz. Okay. But they ran into a problem during their famous Laugh and Frankfurt demonstration. Wait, what was the Laugh and Frankfurt demonstration? It was groundbreaking. They transmitted AC power over 175 kilometers. Wow. It was a huge proof of concept that long distance AC transmission was possible. Definitely. But during this demonstration, they noticed some really bad flickering with their 40 hertz system. Oh, so it was like a public kind of mishap. Yeah, you could say that. Okay. So they decided to bump it up to 50 hertz, and that became the standard in Europe. Okay, so we've got Westinghouse over here at 60 hertz, AEG over there at 50 hertz. Right. But wasn't there another big player in the US, General Electric? Yes. GE was also a major force, and this is where things take a turn. Initially, GE actually aligned with AEG and used 50 hertz. They even built a power plant in California based on that frequency. Wait, so the US had both 50 and 60 hertz systems running at the same time? Yeah, for a while it was a period of transition and some confusion. That's got to be a logistical nightmare. It was. But this is where a brilliant engineer named Charles Proteus Steinmetz comes in. Oh yeah, I've heard that name. He was working for GE, and he identified a problem with resonance in a 125 hertz system. Okay. And get this, he recommended halving the frequency. So if they did that, they would have ended up really close to Westinghouse's 60 hertz. Exactly. It's a real what if moment in history. But remember, this is a very competitive time. GE was facing pressure from Westinghouse, and they needed to standardize. So they switched to 60 hertz. Exactly. In 1894, they made the switch to maintain market share. So it sounds like market forces really played a big role in cementing 60 hertz as the standard in the US. Yeah, they definitely did. But it makes you wonder, why didn't everyone just agree on one frequency from the start? Yeah, that would have made things so much easier. It seems obvious now, but back then, different companies were innovating rapidly and pursuing what they thought was best. There was also very little international collaboration on these standards. Makes sense. It's amazing how these early decisions had such a lasting impact on the world. It really is. But there is one interesting exception to this 60 hertz versus 50 hertz divide. Oh yeah, what's that? Japan. Japan. What happened over there? Well, remember those two Japanese engineers we talked about earlier? The ones who traveled the world? Yeah, they were looking for the best electrical technology, and they ended up bringing back both 50 hertz and 60 hertz systems. So they have both. Yeah, thanks to separate installations by AEG and GE. Oh, wow. So Japan is running on two different frequencies. To this day, they have this split system. It's incredible. How do they even manage that? It's quite a feat of engineering. They have these four massive frequency converter stations that link the two grids together so they can share power across this frequency divide. That's insane. It is. Speaking of engineering feats, one of our sources talks about Southern California Edison. Yeah. They had to convert their whole system from 50 hertz to 60 hertz back in the mid-20th century. Oh, wow. It took them over 20 years. Can you imagine the logistics of a project like that? That's crazy. It really highlights the challenges and costs involved in switching frequencies once a system is already in place. Yeah, it makes those early decisions by Westinghouse, AEG, and GE even more significant. Absolutely. It's like they set the electrical course for generations to come. It's incredible. Yeah. There's still more to uncover, right? Definitely. In part two, we'll delve deeper into the nuances of these frequencies and explore why some systems still use different frequencies today. Okay, so buckle up, listeners. Our journey through the world of power frequencies is just getting started. Welcome back to our electrifying deep dive into power frequencies. You know, before the break, we were talking about how hard it is to change these systems once they're already set up. Right. I mean, 20 years for Southern California Edison to switch over? That's incredible. Yeah, it was a massive undertaking. But it makes me wonder about those systems that didn't switch over. You know, the ones that still use those kind of outlier frequencies today. Yeah, that's a great point. It's easy to think that 50 and 60 hertz are like the only frequencies that matter. Right. But that's not really true. There are certain applications where other frequencies actually make more sense. Like you mentioned aircraft. Exactly. Aircraft are a perfect example. What's so special about the frequencies they use? Well, in aircraft, weight is everything. Right, every pound you can save. Exactly. It all adds up to better fuel efficiency and performance. Okay. And this is where our earlier talk about transformers comes in. Oh yeah, you said that transformers work better at higher frequencies. Exactly. So by using a higher frequency like 400 hertz, which is common in aircraft, they can use smaller and lighter transformers and motors. So it's all about finding that sweet spot between performance and keeping things lightweight. Precisely. That's fascinating. What about those railway systems that use lower frequencies? I remember reading about 25 hertz and even 16 and 2 thirds hertz systems. Why those odd numbers? Those lower frequencies are often linked to older railway systems that use really big, powerful motors like electric locomotives. Right. And those motors tend to run more smoothly and have less wear and tear at those lower frequencies. So even though 50 and 60 hertz kind of won the frequency wars, there are
