## Description

An exploration of OEIS A000149, the floor of e^n sequence: a(n) = floor(e^n) begins 1, 2, 7, 20, 54... We unpack how this simple definition connects to deep ideasâ€”multiplicative growth (and why a(n)^(1/n) â†’ e), links to powers of two and factorials, and the appearance of Benford's law via logarithmic spacing. We also discuss broader questions about Benford behavior in other transcendental-base sequences like pi.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into the world of the OEIS. You know, we love exploring these integer sequences. And as number theory enthusiasts, I think you'll appreciate today's. Absolutely. We've got OEIS entry A000149. Okay. It might seem simple at first glance, but trust me, there are hidden depths here. Indeed. This sequence takes the mathematical constant. He raises it to consecutive powers, starting from zero, and then rounds down to the nearest whole number using the floor function. Using that floor function. So we get 1, 2, 7, 20, 54, and so on. Okay. Now to make sure we're all on the same page, let's quickly break down how this sequence is generated mathematically. Right. We're dealing with e's, approximately 2.71828. Yeah. A fundamental constant in calculus and many other areas of math. Absolutely. And when we say rounding down to the nearest whole number, we're applying the floor function. That's right. Which gives us the greatest integer less than or equal to a given number. So for e to the power of 1, we get approximately 2.71828, and the floor of that is 2 for e squared, which is about 7.389. The floor is 7. Right. And as we go further down the sequence, the terms grow quite rapidly. Yeah, they do. Now the OEIS entry mentions connections to some related sequences. Okay. Like A000079, the powers of 2, and A000244, the factorials. Yes. There's even A06478D, which represents the differences between consecutive terms in our sequence. Yes. It's fascinating how A000149 acts as a bridge between these seemingly disparate sequences. What's particularly intriguing is the behavior of the ratio between consecutive terms. Okay. If we take the nth root of the nth term, represented as A of n to the power of 1 over n, and observe it as n increases, we see this ratio converging to e. So this convergence to e brings us back to one of the fundamental definitions of e itself. Absolutely. The limit of 1 plus 1 over n to the power of n as n approaches infinity. It's remarkable how this seemingly simple operation of raising e to consecutive powers and rounding down leads us right back to a core concept in calculus. It highlights the elegance and interconnectedness of mathematical concepts. Right. Demonstrating how a simple sequence can reveal deep connections to fundamental constants and limit definitions. And there's another fascinating aspect of this sequence. Okay. It exhibits Benford's law. Yeah. Now this might sound counterintuitive, but in many naturally occurring data sets, the leading digit is more likely to be small. That's right. For instance, 1-borm appears as the first digit about 30% of the time, which is much more frequent than a uniform distribution would suggest. That's right. So Benford's law is a surprising statistical principle that often emerges in data sets spanning multiple orders of magnitude. And our sequence, because of its exponential growth, certainly fits that description. So how does a sequence derived from e, a fundamental constant in calculus, end up demonstrating a statistical principle about the distribution of digits in real-world data sets? This connection between A000149 and Benford's law is where things get really interesting. Indeed. It highlights the unexpected ways mathematical ideas can intersect and the deep connections that underlie seemingly disparate areas of mathematics. We'll delve into this connection further in the next part of our deep dive. Okay. Sounds good. So we've established that this sequence derived from e somehow exhibits Benford's law. Right. But why? What's the underlying connection? The key lies in understanding that Benford's law isn't about the numbers themselves. Okay. But about the distribution of their logarithms. Instead of looking at 1, 2, 7, 20, 54, we need to consider the logarithms of those numbers. Interesting. So we shift our focus from the sequence itself to the spacing between the logarithms of its terms. Precisely. When we examine the logarithms of consecutive terms in A000149, we find that their spacing becomes increasingly uniform as we progress down the sequence. This uniformity is crucial because Benford's law tends to emerge when the logarithms of values are distributed relatively evenly across multiple orders of magnitude. I see. So even though the numbers in the sequence grow rapidly, their logarithms become more evenly spaced out. Yes. And it's this even spacing on the logarithmic scale that aligns with Benford's law. Exactly. Could you elaborate on why that even spacing matters? Of course. This behavior is often linked to processes that involve multiplicative growth or decay, like compound interest or radioactive decay. In these processes, the quantities involved change by a certain percentage over time rather than by a fixed amount. This kind of multiplicative change is naturally reflected in the logarithmic scale. So when we see a data set exhibiting Benford's law, it hints at an underlying process involving multiplicative change. Exactly. And since 800149 is generated by repeatedly multiplying e by itself, it inherently exhibits this logarithmic behavior. Exactly. It's like a fingerprint suggesting a specific kind of growth pattern. Okay. Now remember those related sequences we mentioned earlier? A0000079, the powers of 2, and A00244, the factorials. Right. The powers of 2 are formed by repeatedly multiplying by 2, and factorials by multiplying a number by all positive integers less than it. Exactly. So is it possible that these sequences might also exhibit Benford's law? It's certainly a possibility worth investigating. The connection between multiplicative processes and Benford's law is fascinating. Yeah. Exploring those connections within the OEIS could lead to some interesting discoveries. Yeah. This is what makes exploring the OEIS so rewarding. Right. You start with a simple sequence and uncover connections to fundamental definitions, statistical principles, and even potential research avenues. Indeed. And for a number theory student, this is incredibly exciting. We started with a simple operation on e and ended up delving into the intricacies of Benford's law and its potential presence in other OEIS sequences. So we've seen that A000149, generated from the transcendental number, follows Benford's law. Right. But this leads to a question. Yeah. Are there other integer sequences generated from transcendental numbers that might exhibit similar properties? That's an excellent question and a great jumping off point for further exploration. Right. It would be fascinating to investigate whether this behavior is specific to e or if it extends to other transcendental numbers like pi or the golden ratio. Yeah, like pi. Exactly. It really makes you wonder if there are deeper mathematical reasons behind this connection between transcendental numbers, integer sequences, and Benford's law. Indeed. There could be elegant theorems waiting to be discovered in this area. Yeah. Perhaps there's a whole class of integer sequences generated from transcendental numbers that exhibit Benford-like behavior. Right. It highlights the beauty of the OEIS. You start with a simple sequence and it opens up a world of possibilities and potential research avenues. Exactly. Who knows what other hidden connections and mathematical gems are waiting to be uncovered within the vast collection of integer sequences? Absolutely. Perhaps we'll find relationships to other areas of mathematics or even stumble upon unexpected applications in fields we haven't considered. It's certainly possible. It is. It's a reminder that exploration and curiosity are key in the world of mathematics. The OEIS provides a fantastic platform for such explorations. Yeah. And you never know what you might find. You never know. You never know. So to all our number theory enthusiasts out there, we encourage you to keep digging into the OEIS. Yes. There are countless sequences to explore and you might just make a groundbreaking discovery yourself. Absolutely. This concludes our deep dive into A00014. Okay. We hope you enjoyed this journey through the fascinating interplay of calculus, number theory, and statistics. Yeah. Until next time, keep exploring and stay curious.
