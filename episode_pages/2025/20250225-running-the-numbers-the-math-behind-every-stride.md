## Transcript

Welcome back to our mathematics series. Today we'll be looking at running through the lens of mathematics. Yeah, running might seem pretty simple, you know, just putting one foot in front of the other, but there's a surprising amount of math and physics happening with every stride. Yeah, we've got some fascinating research and articles to look at today. We'll be covering everything from basic physics to advanced mathematical models. Definitely. Have you ever wondered how scientists can predict world records? Or why some runners just seem effortlessly fast? That's a good question. Well, we're going to find out. Let's do it. So let's start with the fundamentals. What are the core physics concepts at play when you run? So one of the most basic but really revealing ideas is that when you run, your center of mass doesn't move in a straight line. Oh, really? It follows like a parabolic arc. A parabola? Yeah. Like a ball when you throw it. Exactly. With each stride, your center of mass rises and then falls as you land. For runners, this means the key to efficient running is minimizing the height of that arc. So the less up and down movement, the less energy you waste. Exactly. So it's all about smooth gliding strides rather than bouncing up and down. Yes. I could see how that would make a difference in how you run. Huge difference. So where does ground reaction force fit into this? That's that pushback you feel from the ground with every step. Okay. It propels you forward and it's directly tied to your acceleration. Okay. Thanks to Newton's laws of motion. Makes sense. The harder you push, the faster you accelerate. So physics gives us this like basic understanding of the forces involved. Right. But I know there are also mathematical models that can get incredibly precise. Yes. Even predicting world record times. It's amazing. So how does that work? Well, A.V. Hill was one of the pioneers in this field. Okay. He was a Nobel Prize winning physiologist. Wow. His model was one of the first to describe the relationship between a runner's speed and their energy use. Interesting. It wasn't super complex, but it laid the groundwork for more sophisticated models later on. And one of those later models was developed by Joseph B. Keller, right? Yes, Joseph B. Keller. He was a great mathematician. Yeah, I've heard his name a lot in running circles. For sure. What did he do? Well, he approached running as an optimal control problem. Okay. Imagine trying to find the absolute best path between two points. Okay. Considering terrain and speed limits, that's what optimal control problems are all about. So he used math to figure out the most efficient way to run a certain distance. Exactly. His model revealed two distinct strategies. Okay. One for short sprints and another for longer distances. That makes sense. I'd imagine those would be pretty different approaches. Very different. So let's start with sprints. Sure. How does his model explain what's happening in, say, a 100-meter dash? So his model describes a sprinter's velocity over time, taking into account things like the maximum force they can generate and the resistance they face. Like air resistance? Exactly. And what's interesting is that the model shows that a sprinter's speed increases rapidly at the beginning of the race and then gradually approaches a maximum value. So in a sprint, it's all about that explosive start. Yes. Get to top speed as quickly as possible. But longer races are different. For sure. How does Keller's model apply there? Well, for longer distances, it suggests three distinct phases. Okay. Acceleration, cruising, and deceleration. I'm picturing a graph in my mind. Yeah. Walk me through how those phases play out. So the acceleration phase is similar to a sprint. You're increasing your speed rapidly. Okay. Then you transition to a cruising phase. And this is where it gets interesting. Okay. The model suggests maintaining a pretty constant speed for most of the race. Really? And then there's a slight deceleration as you approach the finish line. So for a long race, I should be aiming for a steady pace. Pretty much. Not speeding up and slowing down. Yeah. It might feel counterintuitive. Yeah, it does. But mathematically, that's the most efficient way to use your energy. Now, of course, we're dealing with like a model here. Of course. In the real world, there's another crucial element we need to think about. Yeah. Fatigue. Big one. Even the best runners in the world don't maintain a perfectly constant speed in marathons. Right. So how does fatigue fit into these mathematical models of running? It adds another layer of complexity. Right. As you get tired, your force production and efficiency go down. Right. Some models try to incorporate this by adding terms that represent the energy loss due to fatigue. So they're trying to capture the fact that your energy reserves deplete over time. Exactly. And it makes it harder to maintain that ideal constant speed. This is getting pretty complex. It is. But before we get too bogged down in its ages, I want to bring it back to our listeners. Okay. How can understanding this math actually help someone become a better runner? That's a great question. Yeah. So while we won't be like crunching numbers on our runs, having this basic understanding of the physics and math can help you make smarter choices. About your training? Yes, and your techniques. So what's the first takeaway you'd give a runner based on all of this? I would say remember that parabolic arc of your center of mass. Okay. Minimizing that vertical movement, that's key. You're saying focus on smooth gliding strides. Exactly. Rather than wasting energy on bouncing up and down. Yes, especially over longer distances. I can definitely see how that would make a difference. For sure. Yeah. And while you might not be able to keep a perfectly constant speed, you know, especially as fatigue sets in, the principle still holds true. You know, finding a sustainable pace that balances speed and energy conservation is key for any runner. Makes a lot of sense if you go out too fast, you're going to burn out quickly. Exactly. You'll probably end up with a slower overall time. Yeah. So it's all about finding that sweet spot. Now we can't talk about running these days without mentioning all the technology that's become available to runners. Right. Especially things like running power meters. Yes. From companies like Stride and RunScribe. Are these gadgets going to like revolutionize the sport by taking the guesswork out of training? They certainly hold a lot of promise. Okay. These power meters use a combination of sensors, including accelerometers, to estimate a runner's power output in real time. Hmm. It's a fascinating development, but there's still debate about how accurate they are. I've heard there are some limitations with these power meters. For sure. What are some of the things they might not be capturing accurately? One of the main criticisms is they struggle to measure the energy a runner gets back from what's called elastic recoil. Elastic recoil? Yeah. Think of it like a spring. Your tendons and muscles store energy when they stretch and then release that energy to help propel you forward. So like a little boost of free energy with each stride. Exactly. And current power meters don't do a great job of quantifying this energy return. Okay. So they might be underestimating a runner's true power output. Interesting. They also don't fully account for internal work, which is the energy needed to just move your limbs. I remember reading a research paper about this. Uh-huh. It argued that focusing solely on external work, like the force used to overcome things like gravity and air resistance, could lead to an incomplete picture of a runner's energy expenditure. Right. Especially at faster speeds. Yes. It highlighted that failing to consider factors like internal work and elastic recoil could result in underestimating the actual workload. Yes. Particularly for runners who maintain a higher pace. That's a really important point if you're not accounting for these internal factors. Right. You're missing a big piece of the energy puzzle. Yeah. And that could impact how runners train and evaluate their performance. So while power meters provide valuable data... Yeah. They shouldn't be taken as like the absolute truth. For sure. What are some of the other metrics runners might see on these devices? And what should they keep in mind when interpreting them? So you might come across metrics like running effectiveness or leg spring stiffness. Okay. Running effectiveness tries to quantify how well a runner converts power into speed. In simple terms, it's a measure of how much speed you're getting for a given power output. Okay. The idea is that a more effective runner will go faster while using less energy. That sounds like a useful metric. It is. But I imagine there's nuance to how it's calculated and what factors influence it. Definitely. What about leg spring stiffness? That relates to how much your tendons and muscles behave like a spring during your stride. Okay. A stiffer spring can mean a more efficient stride, but there's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to the optimal level of stiffness. Right. It varies depending on the person and what kind of running they're doing. It seems like we're still in the early stages of understanding how to apply all of these metrics and technology to actually improve running performance. Yes. What are some of the big questions that researchers are still trying to answer? Well, one of the biggest mysteries is why some runners are so much more efficient than others. Yeah. We see this, for example, with East African runners who have dominated long-distance events for decades. Right. Is it their genetics, training methods, or a combo of factors? We're still trying to figure that out. It's a question that has fascinated scientists and coaches for a long time. It has. There's also a lot of debate about running form and foot strike patterns. Does heel striking
