## Description

In The Deep Dive, we explore Google DeepMind's Aeneasâ€”an AI that can restore fragmented Latin and Greek inscriptions, predict their origin, and date them within a historical window from 800 BCE to 800 CE. We unpack how it learns from vast epigraphic databases, leverages text and image cues, and presents transparent reasoning with ranked restoration options and probabilistic geography. Join us as we consider what this means for historians, classicists, and curious enthusiasts alike, and how this digital Sherlock Holmes reshapes our view of the ancient world.

## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive. Today we're embarking on, well, an extraordinary journey really, right at this fascinating intersection of ancient history and cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Imagine this scenario for a second. You're an archaeologist, maybe, or perhaps just a curious historian staring at a stone inscription from ancient Rome or Greece. But, you know, time, weather, maybe even human hands have taken their toll. The text is fragmented, it's partially unreadable, just filled with gaps. For centuries, piecing these things together has been this meticulous, often agonizing labor of love. But what if you could take that damaged, enigmatic text and, using the power of AI, not only fill in those missing characters, but also precisely pinpoint where it came from and when it was created? Sounds almost too good to be true, doesn't it? Well, today we're diving deep into Aeneas, a powerful new tool from Google DeepMind that is really poised to fundamentally transform how historians, classicists, and even, you know, enthusiastic amateurs connect with the profound echoes of the past. That's absolutely right. Our mission in this deep dive is to truly unpack Aeneas' incredible capabilities, explore the ingenious ways it works its magic, and crucially, understand the deep, lasting impact it's going to have, you know, on our understanding of ancient texts and the complex civilizations that painstakingly crafted and left them behind for us. We'll sort of peel back the layers of its functionality, showing you how it moves from just deciphering broken inscriptions to accurately placing them on a map and firmly within a historical timeline. Okay, so let's really get into the fundamental challenge that Aeneas addresses first, because for millennia, accessing and understanding ancient records has been a monumental task. When we talk about ancient texts, especially these inscriptions etched onto stone or metal, even clay tablets, they rarely survive intact. Just think about it. A decree carved into marble, maybe a dedication on a bronze statue or a tombstone epitaph, all exposed to the relentless march of time. Right. Weathering, natural disasters, accidental damage, sometimes even intentional defacement. It's left us with countless fragments. And historians have traditionally spent years, sometimes, like you said, entire careers, meticulously piecing together these scattered remnants. It demands just encyclopedic knowledge of ancient languages, a profound understanding of historical contexts, and frankly, a remarkable knack for educated guesswork. It's a testament to human dedication, absolutely, but it's also incredibly demanding, often slow, and it can be deeply frustrating when you're faced with these seemingly insurmountable gaps. And that's precisely where Aeneas steps in as, well, what I can only describe as a genuine game changer. It's a sophisticated generative neural network designed specifically to tackle these very challenges for ancient Latin and Greek texts. Its core purpose isn't just transcription. It's to help contextualize, restore, and accurately attribute these incredibly important historical artifacts. You could really think of it as a kind of digital Sherlock Holmes for epigraphy. That's the study and interpretation of ancient inscriptions, for anyone unfamiliar. A digital Sherlock Holmes, I like that. Yeah, it approaches these historical puzzles with an unprecedented level of computational power and pattern recognition. What's truly astonishing, and I think foundational to its success, is just the sheer scale of the data Aeneas was trained on. This isn't just, you know, a few dozen texts we're talking about. Oh no, not at all. Aeneas was fed and trained on truly vast databases of ancient inscriptions. This massive amount allows it to learn the nuances of language and historical context from, well, an almost unimaginable collection of real-world examples. For Latin, we're talking about comprehensive and authoritative sources like the Epigraphic Database Roma, the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg, and the Epigraphic Database Claus Slaby. Really, the gold standards. Okay. And for Greek, it pulled from the immense, searchable Greek inscriptions from the Packard Humanities Institute. This monumental data set is what enables it to learn patterns, understand historical context, and essentially read the language with a depth that lets it predict and fill in those crucial blanks. It's like having a library of millions of ancient documents right at its fingertips, basically. Each one informing its understanding. Okay, so let's explore Aeneas' three core functions then, because this is where the practical applications for researchers and really anyone curious about the past truly come to life. These are the aspects that offer those profound moments of insight. Absolutely. First up, we have restoration, filling in the blanks. So imagine you're a historian working with a broken inscription. You might have only parts of words or maybe long stretches of missing text. Traditionally, you'd be cross-referencing known phrases, consulting lexicons, drawing upon your deep expertise to hypothesize what might have been there. It's painstaking work. Yeah, I can only imagine. With Aeneas, you simply input the fragmented text using a question mark, just the standard for each missing character. That's the signal. Okay. Aeneas can then intelligently predict up to 20 missing characters. And that's whether those gaps are consecutive or just scattered throughout the text. Even spaces count towards that limit, so it's remarkably flexible in handling different types of damage. 20 characters. That capability alone is transformative. So if I had a challenging inscription, maybe something like, and I'm reading this example, diab hashtag an et tutule loke pro salute et in comitate sua suarum minimum el maiores cogitatus, desiderias consulares vox sol, LLM, idibus ilis Gentiano et passo cosulibus. Where that hashtag symbol represents, well, who knows how many missing letters. Right, an unknown gap. Aeneas can actually propose how to complete that. This is the kind of problem that could puzzle a human expert for weeks, maybe longer. Precisely. It analyzes the surrounding text, drawing on those immense linguistic and historical patterns it learned from its training data, and then proposes the most probable missing letters. But, and this is important, it doesn't just give you one single answer and walk away. Aeneas provides a list of top restoration hypotheses, all rigorously ranked by probability. Ah, okay. Options. That's key for scholars, offering alternative interpretations. Exactly. And to give you even deeper insight into its reasoning, its thinking process, it also generates what's called a saliency map. This visually highlights which parts of your input text were most important for the model's prediction. So it shows its work, essentially. Yes. It's not a black box. It's a very transparent way of showing its work, allowing historians to understand the rationale behind its suggestions. They could even use it to prioritize, say, further investigation of a physical artifact if the map points to a critical but maybe uncertain fragment. That makes sense. It fast-tracks breakthroughs that, as you said, used to take lifetimes of meticulous, often frustrating manual labor. It really does. Okay, next up, attribution. Where and when? Now, for historians, knowing the provenance, that is, where and when an inscription was made, it isn't just a minor detail. It's absolutely crucial for understanding its significance. Could agree more. Without this context, a text is just, well, a collection of words. With it, it offers invaluable insights into the local culture of a region. Maybe the economy that supported its creation, specific social or religious practices, or even significant political shifts happening at that particular time and place. Think about how different an imperial decree would be if it came from Rome itself versus, say, a remote province on the frontier. The context changes everything. And Aeneas is remarkably adept at providing this vital context. For geographical attribution, it can predict the top 10 most probable ancient Roman provinces where a text originated. Top 10, okay. Yeah, giving you a ranked list. For Latin texts, it considers 62 possible regions. And for Greek, that number goes up to 84. The results are presented with probabilities, which is key, and you can even visualize them on a map. On a map, how does that work? The size of the circles on the map represents the model's confidence in its prediction for that region. So bigger circle, higher probability. That's fantastic. Imagine discovering a Latin inscription in a region not typically associated with Roman presence. Aeneas might confirm or maybe challenge your initial assumptions about its origin. It could reveal surprising trade routes or military movements. Exactly, it opens up new avenues of inquiry. So you get this literal heat map of potential locations, incredibly powerful for visualizing historical connections. And it also tackles chronological attribution, right? Predicting the when. Yes, it predicts the decade an inscription was created. And it covers this massive period from 800 BCE all the way up to 800 CE using helpful 10-year intervals. That time frame alone covers, well, the rise and fall of empires, major cultural shifts, countless historical events. Knowing the decade can be the difference between understanding a text as part of the Republic or the early Empire or the late Roman period, each with vastly different historical implications. Absolutely, and this is where it gets even more interesting visually, I think. For chronological attribution, Aeneas can optionally incorporate an actual image of the inscription itself. An image, so not just the text. Correct. The model processes that image, it converts it to grayscale, resizes it to a standard 224 by 224 pixels, applies noise reduction to clean up imperfections, and during its training, it even introduces random augmentations like skewing or rotation. This makes it super robust and adaptable to real-world conditions, like a photo taken at an awkward angle in a museum. Clever. This visual data, which captures characteristics like letter forms, the spacing, carving styles, that then aids its date prediction. It presents this as a bar chart showing the probability distribution across the centuries. So it's using not just the words, but the actual look of the writing to help place it in time, recognizing how
