## Transcript

Welcome back to the OEIS Deep Dive Series, where we unpack fascinating integer sequences. Today we're taking a look at A000089. Now I know sequences about quadratic congruences might not sound like the most thrilling way to spend your time, but trust me, this one gets surprisingly deep. We're talking connections to prime numbers, Legendre symbols, even elliptic curves. What's fascinating about A000089 is that it hides a lot of complexity beneath a deceptively simple concept. It all starts with counting solutions to the equation x^2 + 1 â‰¡ 0 mod n. So for our listeners who might need a quick refresher, we're essentially looking for values of x, where when you square x and add 1, the result is perfectly divisible by n. Precisely. And the sequence itself lists the number of these solutions for each value of n. It starts 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. And as you can see, there's no immediately obvious pattern. Which makes it even more intriguing. Definitely. Now one of the first things that jumped out at me from the OEIS entry was this multiplicative property. It seems almost too good to be true. Right. If you know the number of solutions for two relatively prime numbers, you could just multiply those counts to get the solution count for their product. Is it really that straightforward? It is. Really. And that elegance is what makes this sequence so appealing. Wow. Imagine trying to figure out the solution count for a large number, let's say 30. With the multiplicative property, we can break it down into its prime factors, 2, 3, and 5. If we know the solution counts for those smaller primes, we instantly know the count for 30 without any tedious calculations. Okay, so that's a pretty powerful tool. It is. Can we maybe see it in action? Sure. What if we took a smaller value for n, say 5, and walked through finding the solution? Absolutely. For n equals 5, we're looking for values of x between 0 and 4 that satisfy our equation. Okay. If we test each value, we'll find that x equals 2 and x equals 3 are the only solutions. Okay. 2 squared plus 1 is 5. Right. And 3 squared plus 1 is 10. Yeah. Both divisible by 5. Perfect. And if we check the fifth entry in our sequence, it is indeed 2. Perfect. It matches up. Yeah. But this makes me think, the multiplicative property hinges on those numbers being relatively prime. Right. What happens if we take a number like 10, which has the prime factors 2 and 5, but they're not all distinct? That's a great question. Yeah. And it leads us to some of the nuances of the sequence. Okay. While the multiplicative property holds true in many cases, it needs some additional rules, especially when dealing with powers of 2. Interesting. Yeah. So we've got this general framework that works beautifully in many cases. But then there are these intriguing exceptions that emerge, depending on the prime factors involved. Right. I have a feeling prime numbers are going to play a big role in understanding this sequence. You're absolutely right. Okay. In fact, the behavior of A00089 changes dramatically based on whether n is divisible by 4 or if it's a prime number of a particular form. Okay. And that's where things start to get really interesting. Okay. But let's delve into that in part 2 of our deep dive. Okay. Sounds good. So before we went to part 2, we were starting to uncover how prime numbers really drive the behavior of A00089. Right. You mentioned that things change depending on whether n is divisible by 4 or takes on a specific prime form. Yeah. What's so special about these cases? It all comes down to the structure of the equation. Okay. x squared plus 1, 0 mod n. Okay. Let's start with the case where n is divisible by 4. Okay. We actually touched upon this earlier with the example of n 10. Right. The rule here is surprisingly straightforward. Okay. If n has 4 as a factor, then the number of solutions is always 0. So no matter what value we try for x, we'll never get a result that's perfectly divisible by n if n is 4 lurking in its prime factorization. Exactly. That's pretty definitive. It is. And this is a great illustration of why understanding prime factorization is key to deciphering this sequence. Okay. Now the other case where n is a prime of a particular form is where things get even more intriguing. Okay. The source material specifically mentions primes that are congruent to 1 modulo 4. Right. What this means is that when you divide that prime by 4, the remainder is 1. Like our example within n 5 earlier. Yes. 5 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 1. Right. So 5 fits this description. Yes. And if I recall, we found two solutions for that case. Yeah. Is there a connection? There absolutely is. The rule for these types of primes is that if n is a prime congruent to 1 modulo 4, then there are always two solutions to our equation. It's amazing how the number of solutions seems tied to these very specific properties of prime numbers. Uh-huh. But why is this the case? What is it about primes congruent to 1 modulo 4 that leads to those two solutions? The why delves a bit deeper into number theory. Okay. Specifically, how squares behave modulo these primes. Okay. Imagine arranging all possible squares modulo a prime congruent to 1 modulo 4. Okay. You'd find that modulo 1 appears as one of those squares. Okay. This means modulo 1 can be expressed as the square of some integer modulo that prime, which directly relates to our equation. Okay. I think I'm starting to see the connection. Yeah. Since we're essentially looking for when x squared mod n is congruent to modulo 1 modulo n. Right. Knowing that modulo 1 can be expressed as a square modulo these specific primes guarantees the solutions. Precisely. Okay. And this is where a tool called Legendre symbols comes in handy. Okay. The Legendre symbol for modulo 1 modulo a prime p will tell us whether modulo 1 is a quadratic residue modulo p. Right. In simpler terms, it tells us if modulo 1 can be expressed as a square modulo that prime. So the Legendre symbol can cut through all the calculations and tells directly whether we'll have solutions. Exactly. That's pretty powerful. It is. But how does this tie back to A000089 specifically? Remember, our sequence is all about counting solutions. Right. If the Legendre symbol for minus 1 modulo n is plus 1, we know there are solutions. If it's minus 1, there are no solutions. Okay. A000089 encodes this information directly. Okay. Its entries for primes congruent to 1 modulo 4 will be 2, reflecting those two guaranteed solutions. Wow. So this seemingly simple sequence about counting solutions is deeply connected to the intricate world of prime numbers and quadratic residues. It is. This is way more complex than I initially imagined. Yeah. And believe it or not, the rabbit hole goes even deeper. Yeah. The source material hints at connections to even more advanced areas, like elliptic curves and quadratic forms. Absolutely. Those sound like topics for future deep dives. Exactly. For now, though, I think we've uncovered a remarkable amount about A000089. This sequence highlights how even seemingly simple mathematical ideas can have surprising depth and far-reaching connections. Absolutely. It reminds us that the beauty of mathematics often lies in these unexpected connections. Absolutely. And with that, let's move to our final part, where we'll summarize our key takeaways from exploring A000089 and consider some thought-provoking questions. Okay. Sounds good. Welcome back. We've been on quite a journey with A000089, exploring how this sequence about counting solutions to a simple equation ties into some pretty complex number theory concepts. It's a great example of how exploration within the OEIS can lead us down unexpected paths, revealing connections we might not have anticipated. Absolutely. So for our listeners who may have just joined us, let's recap the key takeaways from our deep dive into A000089. Okay. We started with the equation x^2 plus 1 â‰¡ 0 mod n, which essentially asks for a given number. And how many values of x can we find where when we square x and add 1, the result is perfectly divisible by n? And the sequence A000089 simply lists the number of those solutions for each value of n. But as we've seen, that simple premise leads to a surprisingly intricate pattern. One of the first fascinating properties we encountered was the multiplicative property. It allows us to break down a number into its prime factors, and if those primes are relatively prime to each other, just multiply the solution counts for each factor to get the solution count for the original number. Right. And it makes calculating some of the larger terms much, much easier. Exactly. It's a really elegant property that highlights the structure underlying the sequence. But as we dug deeper, we discovered that prime numbers themselves play a crucial role in determining the number of solutions. Yeah, prime numbers are really at the heart of this sequence. Right. We found that if n is divisible by 4, there are no solutions at all. And if n happens to be a prime number that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, those primes congruent to 1 modulo 4, we're guaranteed to have exactly two solutions. Yeah, and that's one of the most fascinating things about this sequence, how these specific types of prime numbers just completely change the behavior
