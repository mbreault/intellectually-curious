## Transcript

Imagine a country with a landscape as dramatic as its history. We're talking rugged mountains, snow-capped peaks, stunning coastlines. Yeah, a place that's really stood at the crossroads of empires. Exactly. And fiercely guarded its identity through centuries of, well, everything really, invasions, transformations. Today, we're taking a deep dive into the fascinating history of Albania. Our mission really is to unpack the layers of its past and present. Right. Offering you a shortcut to understanding this incredibly resilient nation, we'll cover everything from its earliest inhabitants right up to its modern aspirations. And we'll be pulling out key bits of knowledge, surprising facts, using historical accounts, geographical data, cultural insights, the whole lot. Okay, so to really get a feel for Albania's spirit, we need to go way back to the very beginning. What do we know about the earliest humans there? Well, the traces go back incredibly far. Middle and upper Paleolithic. Wow. Yeah, we've got finds in places like the Zari Cave, things like flint and jasper objects, fossilized animal bones. And up on Mount Daci, there are bone and stone tools. They look similar to the Aurignacian culture. So really ancient connections. Definitely. And then there are major Neolithic sites too, like Malek and Butrint. It shows people have been developing societies there for millennia. It sounds like a truly ancient heritage. And within that, there's this key group, right? The Illyrians. How do they fit in? Ah, yes, the Illyrians. Before Macedon rose to power, this area was basically the heartland of several powerful Illyrian tribes. Not just scattered groups then. No, no, they were the dominant power. Tribes like the Ardi, the Talantians, several others. And what's really fascinating is the name Albania itself. It's believed to trace back to an Illyrian tribe, the Albani. Really? Yeah. And you even have the ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy mentioning a settlement called Albanopolis back in the 2nd century AD. Where was that supposed to be? Northeast of modern-day Durres. So it really suggests this deep historical connection linking the name, the people, the land way back. So these roots are incredibly deep. But when do we get the first absolutely undisputed mention of Albanians in the historical records? Good question. That pops up with the Byzantine historian Michael Ataliates around 1079 or 1080. Okay, what did he say? He mentions them taking part in a revolt against Constantinople. So they were clearly a distinct group active in the region by then. And Christianized by that point. Yes, fully Christianized. Which is an important piece of the puzzle for understanding what happens later with religious shifts. Right, so with this identity emerging, did anything like an early Albanian state start to form? It did, yeah. In the 11th century, you have the Great Schism happening, right? Between the Eastern Orthodox and Western Catholic churches. And that divide was reflected in Albania. You had a mostly Catholic north and a mostly Orthodox south. Interesting. And right in the middle of all this, the Principality of Arbanon was established around 1190 by a leader named Progon of Kruja. Arbanon. His sons, Gigen and Demeter, followed him. And this is really seen as the first kind of, well, sketch of an Albanian state. How long did it last? It had semi-autonomous status within the Byzantine Empire for a while, but it dissolved in the 13th century. A first attempt, you could say. So as Arbanon fades, another major power is rising. The Ottoman Empire. Right, expanding westward. Exactly. They started pushing into Southeast Europe, reached the Albanian coast by 1385, and by 1431, they'd occupied most of Albania. A huge shift. But this also sets the stage for someone truly remarkable, doesn't it? Albania's national hero. Absolutely. This is where Gijerd Kastrioti Skanderbeg enters the story. The 15th century. He basically turned Albania into the center of resistance against the Ottomans. He'd served the Ottomans before, right? Yeah, for nearly 20 years. Then, in 1443, he deserted and launched this incredibly successful rebellion. How did he manage that? Well, his genius was partly military, but also political. He united several Albanian principalities, the Arjanitis, Dukajinis, others, under what was called the League of Lezhe. Ah, so a united front. Precisely. And his campaigns consistently defeated major Ottoman armies. It was quite extraordinary. What was the impact of his resistance? Huge. It delayed Ottoman expansion into Western Europe for about 25 years, gave the Italian principalities crucial time to prepare. Wow. But maybe more importantly, Skanderbeg forged this enduring image, this myth of Albanian resistance and fierce independence that resonates right down to today. It's fundamental to their identity. But despite Skanderbeg's incredible fight, Albania did eventually become part of the Ottoman Empire for centuries, right? Yes, over four centuries. It was a long period. What was life like under Ottoman rule? How did they hold on to their identity? Well, it was complex. As Christians initially, Albanians faced heavy taxes. And there was the Devshirm system. The conscription of boys. Yes, the blood tax, taking Christian adolescents for the Janissary Corps. It was brutal. And over time, there was a gradual process of Islamization. Lots of mosques were built. So significant changes. Definitely. But here's the fascinating part. Despite all that, Albanian culture and social identity remained remarkably distinct. They absorbed influences, yes, but kept a core sense of self. That resilience again. Exactly. It's a recurring theme. And interestingly, quite a few Albanians actually rose to very prominent positions within the Ottoman government during this time. So it wasn't just subjugation. There was integration, too, in a way. Given those centuries under foreign rule, how did the idea of a modern, independent Albanian nation start to really bubble up? That happens mainly in the late 18th and 19th centuries. It's called the Albanian Renaissance or Rilindja. Rilindja. Okay. It was this period of spiritual and intellectual reawakening, a real flourishing of modern Albanian culture, literature, arts, often tied to Romanticism and Enlightenment ideas. Even with the Ottomans trying to suppress it. Yes. Despite Ottoman efforts to clamp down on national unity, it showed a really deep desire for self-determination was growing. And then came a big trigger moment, the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878. What happened there? It proposed giving lands populated by Albanians to their Slavic and Greek neighbors. Oh, that wouldn't have gone down well. Not at all. Now, that specific plan was blocked by the UK and Austria-Hungary, but the threat itself was a huge catalyst. How so? It spurred Albanians to get organized, led directly to the forming of the League of Prizren in 1878. Okay, and their goal? To protect Albanian-populated lands and unite them into one nation. A really pivotal moment for modern Albanian nationalism. So this momentum builds and builds, leading to independence. Exactly. After more revolts, including a big one in 1912 against the Ottomans, and facing threats from Serbia and Greece wanting to carve up the territory. A lot of pressure. Immense pressure. Albania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire on November 28, 1912. A huge moment. Massive. Ismail Kemali, he's seen as the founding father, raised the national flag in the city of Glory. The famous double-headed eagle flag. That's the one. A symbol directly linked back to Skanderbeg's legacy. A new beginning, but one deeply rooted in that history of resistance. But declaring independence is one thing. Making it stick. Establishing a stable country. That must have been tough. Extremely tough. Sovereignty was recognized internationally at the Conference of London. But the Treaty of London in 1913 drew borders that, well, they left a lot of Albanians outside the new state. Where did they end up? Mostly in areas given to Montenegro, Serbia, and Greece. This created problems that linger even today. And internally, was it stable? Not really. Those early years were turbulent. Internal peasant revolts. The Greeks in the south proclaiming an autonomous republic of northern Epirus. Chaos? Pretty much. It led to the collapse of the short-lived government under Prince William of Wyde in 1914. Stability was a long way off. So let's talk about those interwar years. What defined that period for Albania? Well, persistent problems. Economic difficulties, social issues, and just chronic political instability. Like how unstable? Like this. Between July and December 1921, they went through five different prime ministers. Wow. That's a lot. Tells you something, right? Plus, without firm borders or a strong government after World War I, they were really vulnerable. Neighbors like Greece, Italy, Yugoslavia were constantly trying to exert influence, expand their own interests. Making it hard to build a cohesive state. Incredibly hard. It was a very challenging time. And then the world is plunged into World War II. How did Albania get caught up in that? Italy, under Mussolini, had its eyes on Albania. They invaded in April 1939. Before the wider war even really kicked off. Exactly. King Zog was exiled and Italy set up a protectorate. Even had ambitions for a greater Albania under Italian control. And when Italy's power faded? Nazi Germany took
