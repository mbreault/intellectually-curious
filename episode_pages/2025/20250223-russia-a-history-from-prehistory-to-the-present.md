## Transcript

All right, let's dive deep into Russian history. It's a massive subject we're talking about. Everything from like the very first settlements all the way to like, you know, today's world and all the complex geopolitics. So mostly using Wikipedia as our source, we'll be looking at sort of like the big picture of Russian history, but also some interesting specifics about the modern Russian Federation. By the end of this deep dive, you should have a pretty good understanding of the major eras and hopefully, you know, come away with some fascinating little details along the way. Yeah, I think one thing that really grabs your attention is how far back human presence in Russia goes. You know, there's evidence of Homo erectus on the Taman Peninsula. We're talking like two million years ago. That's way before lots of other parts of Europe were even inhabited. Two million years? Wow, that's mind-blowing. It really changes how you think about like how long this area has been, a place where humans have been living and doing their thing. And it wasn't just like they popped in and out, right? I mean, there were those 1.5 million-year-old flint tools found in the North Caucasus. Pretty clear that early humans were settling down there. Yeah, exactly. I mean, those tools show how clever and adaptable they were. And then when you think about the later discoveries, like Denis, that Denisovan-Neanderthal hybrid found in the Altai Mountains, it kind of paints this picture of Russia as like a meeting point for different hominid groups. You know, tens of thousands of years ago, they were interacting, maybe even interbreeding. Makes you wonder how those encounters shaped like the whole path of human evolution in the region. It's like going back in time, uncovering these layers. And with each discovery, you realize the past is way more intricate and connected than we ever imagined. So we've got these early humans setting the scene, but then come these new arrivals who really shake things up. I'm talking about the Varangians, those Vikings, sailing all over the waterways of what we now call Russia. Right. Their arrival in the 9th century was a huge turning point. It's just incredible to imagine that these skilled navigators and warriors heading into these vast unknown lands, their impact on early Russian history is undeniable. And one of the most enduring stories from that time is about Rurik, the Varangian chieftain who, according to the Primary Chronicle, was asked to rule Novgorod in 862. Rurik. It's almost like something out of legend. This warrior coming from across the sea to rule a Slavic city. And from this almost mythical beginning, you have a dynasty that shapes the political scene for centuries. Oleg, his successor, went on to conquer Kiev just a few decades later, strategically positioned on the Dnieper River. This conquest wasn't just about taking land. It was a show of force. It cemented the Varangian presence and laid the groundwork for what we know as Kievanossus. And this rise of Kievan Russes, it had huge ripple effects. Think about what happened to the Khazar Khaganate. They were a powerful force in the region, but in the end, they couldn't withstand the Russian princes. It just goes to show that the balance of power is always shifting throughout history. Speaking of power, there are few figures who embody the sheer force of personality and ambition. Quite like Ivan the Terrible. He took the rather bold step of crowning himself czar in 1547. This wasn't just about a fancy title, was it? It was a declaration that Moscow was the third Rome, inheriting the legacy of both the Roman and Byzantine empires. What a weighty concept. Oh, it's a concept that runs deep throughout Russian history, even today. This idea of Moscow as the third Rome, the protector of Orthodox Christianity, it really solidified this sense of destiny, of Russian exceptionalism, you know? And it justified expansion, bringing the Eastern Slavic lands under Moscow's rule. And Ivan the Terrible definitely put that idea into action, right? His reign was this whirlwind of legal and military reforms, pushing east into Siberia, south toward the Caspian Sea. And even with some setbacks, like the Livonian War, it shows that even terrible rulers aren't unbeatable. Yeah, his reign is full of contradictions. Brutality and piety, expansion and internal conflict. He centralized power, took down the old aristocracy, but also unleashed unbelievable violence during the Oprychnina, a time of state-sponsored terror. It's a period that continues to fascinate and horrify historians. It reveals both the strength and the darkness that would define Russian autocracy. But Russia's story isn't just about scary rulers and military might. It's also about times of cultural flourishing, like with Catherine the Great. She presided over the Russian Age of Enlightenment, a time when intellectual life was booming and people were engaging with European ideas. Right, and let's not forget her political skills. Under Catherine, Russia gained huge amounts of territory, including control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and expansion toward the Black Sea. She understood the importance of projecting power, militarily and culturally. Catherine was a patron of the arts and sciences. She corresponded with Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire and modernized the Russian state. She even oversaw the exploration and colonization of Alaska, extending Russia's reach across continents. It's a fascinating period that shows Russia's ambitions on the world stage. Catherine knew that to be a true power, Russia couldn't just be a force in Europe, it had to be global. Her reign really sets the stage for the empire building that would define the 19th century. But before we get there, we have to talk about the crazy 20th century. It's a period of dramatic upheaval, starting with World War I, which ended centuries of czarist rule and plunged Russia into revolution. World War I was a breaking point for Russia. It exposed the deep social and economic problems that had been brewing for decades. Military defeats, food shortages, economic collapse, it all fueled discontent and ultimately led to the fall of Tsar Nicholas II. And out of this chaos, you have different forces fighting for power, the provisional government trying to set up a democratic republic, and the Petrograd Soviet representing workers and soldiers. It was a really volatile time, a power struggle that would decide the fate of Russia. And into this mess stepped the Bolsheviks, a radical socialist party led by the charismatic and ruthless Vladimir Lenin. Their seizure of power in October 1917, the Bolshevik Revolution. It was a world-changing event. It brought about the creation of the first socialist state, the Soviet Union. It sent shockwaves across the globe. It was a radical experiment, an attempt to create a whole new society based on Marxist principles. And it came at a huge cost. The Russian Civil War was brutal, pitting the Red Army of the Bolsheviks against all those opposed to communist rule. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk got Russia out of World War I. But it forced them to give up a ton of territory. A tough pill to swallow, but it let the Bolsheviks solidify their power and focus on building their new socialist state. And that process of building the Soviet Union would define the 20th century, a period marked by incredible achievements and unimaginable suffering. From the horrors of Stalin's reign and the devastation of World War II, to the Cold War rivalry with the West and the triumphs of the space race. The Soviet era is a complicated tapestry. It's woven from threads of idealism, terror, resilience, and innovation. It's a period that deserves its own deep dive. But for now, let's move to the last chapter of our quick tour of Russian history, the post-Soviet era. By the 1980s, the seemingly unshakable Soviet system was crumbling. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, tried to reform the system with glasnost and perestroika. Glasnost, openness, was about making the government more transparent and accountable. And perestroika, restructuring, was meant to revitalize the stagnant Soviet economy. These reforms, though well-intentioned, had unforeseen consequences. They unleashed forces Gorbachev couldn't control, leading to unrest, the rise of nationalist movements, and ultimately, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of an empire and the start of a new era for Russia. The new Russian Federation faced a mountain of challenges, transitioning to a market economy, rebuilding its political institutions, and figuring out its place in a post-Cold War world. And from this turbulent period, Vladimir Putin emerges. He would profoundly shape Russia's course in the 21st century. His rise to power, his assertive foreign policy, his impact on Russian society, these are all things we'll explore more as we delve into modern Russia. But before we do, I think it's important to just take a moment and reflect on the massive scope of history we've covered. From ancient settlements to imperial grandeur, from revolution to superpower status. Russia's past shows the enduring power of this place and the complexities of human experience. It reminds us that history isn't just a bunch of dates and facts. It's a story, a narrative that shapes how we see the present and guides our choices for the future. As we move on to explore modern Russia, we'll see how echoes of the past continue to resonate today, shaping its identity, politics, and its place in the world. So we've gone through centuries of Russian history, and now here we are at the start of the 21st century, a time marked by both, you know, things staying the same and things changing. Russia, after shedding its Soviet identity, is trying to find its way as the Russian Federation, a country wrestling with its past while trying to assert
