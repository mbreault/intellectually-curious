## Description

In this deep dive, we explore how AI is unbundling elite professionsâ€”taking over repeatable, data-heavy tasks in law, medicine, and finance. Through concrete stories, from a New York partner getting a 45-second AI synthesis to historical parallels of disruption, we examine what this shift means for prestige, employment, and the practical ways listeners can adapt today.

## Transcript

Okay, let's dig into this. We've been looking at some really fascinating source material. It lays out a pretty provocative argument, actually. Yeah, it really does. It's all about how AI is, well, hitting those professions we always think of as, you know, the absolute top tier. Law, medicine, finance, engineering do. Right, the elite professions. But what grabbed me from the sources is this specific angle. It's not just saying AI is taking jobs, which we hear a lot about. It's arguing for something maybe more subtle. The sources call it unbundling. Exactly, unbundling. And the implication they draw is potentially huge. Maybe even the end of prestige for these roles that have been, you know, untouchable for so long. The end of prestige. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, that's a big statement. Okay, so that's our mission for this deep dive. Let's unpack what this source material is telling us about this, well, this quiet revolution that seems to be underway. And crucially, what it might mean for you listening. Yeah, definitely. And you know, what really struck me reading through this stuff was how it starts. It doesn't just jump into theories. No, it uses a story, right, to show this isn't some far-off future thing. Precisely. It makes it clear this is happening, like, right now. Yeah, they tell this really vivid story about Jonathan Sterling. He's described as a partner at a big New York law firm. You know, the kind whose judgment and experience is billed out at thousands an hour. Right. That's been his value proposition for years. But the source says his most powerful tool now. It isn't just his legal brain or decades of knowing precedent. No, it's quite different. The source describes a scenario where Sterling has this super complex regulatory question spanning, what, four different jurisdictions? Yeah. Something that, you know, traditionally would mean weeks of work, research, memos, a whole team digging through things. The classic junior associate grind work, basically. Exactly. But instead of farming it out to them, the source says he just types this complicated query into, what was it called, Casey, an AI platform the firm uses. And here's the kicker from the source material. 45 seconds later, not weeks, not days, 45 seconds. Casey delivers this synthesis. Relevant precedents, statutes, even a risk assessment. And the source really emphasizes this point. It wasn't just fast, it was arguably more comprehensive than what a single junior associate could pull together, especially that quickly. 45 seconds, that's... Yeah. Well, it's almost hard to believe. And the really pointed detail the source adds is that the junior associates, the ones with the massive student loans banking on those entry-level roles, they never even saw the file. It just bypassed them completely. And the source uses that anecdote, that specific story, as more than just, you know, an interesting case. They frame it as a signpost. This is already happening, they say, across these high-skill fields. And it's not just anecdotes, right? The source material connects this to broader data. It does. It points to reporting, just from this past spring, actually, showing a really significant drop. They call it a steep, alarming decline in available entry-level jobs, specifically in law and finance. And the key distinction the source makes here, which I thought was important, is that this isn't your typical recession dip. It's not just cyclical layoffs. No, it's framed as something more fundamental. Efficiency-driven disruption, I think, was the phrase. Right. And it's hitting, as the source puts it, the foot soldiers first. The junior ranks. The very people who are supposed to be learning the ropes. Yeah, exactly. What's really fascinating, though, when you dive into this material, is how they put this moment into, like, a much bigger historical context. Ah, the historical parallel. Yes. The sources argue, look, this kind of disruption, where technology just completely upends a prestigious, established role, we've actually seen this movie before. Yeah. They bring up examples like scribes back in medieval times. Hugely important, prestigious job, right? Yeah. They were the gatekeepers of knowledge because they copied everything by hand. Immense power. Then along comes Gutenberg and the printing press. And poof. That whole profession, its status just sort of collapses. Or, another one they mention, those really skilled textile artisans, you know, before the Industrial Revolution, masters of their craft, vital to local economies. Right. And then automated looms come in, and suddenly that deep, hands-on expertise becomes, well, much less valuable almost overnight. The source uses these to show how fast value can shift when the underlying tech changes. And they don't stop in the distant past. They bring up more recent examples, too. Yeah, things maybe more in living memory, like travel agents. Their whole value was access to booking systems and information. Then online travel sites arrived. Or typists with word processors. Or even retail stockbrokers, largely replaced by online trading platforms. Right. In every case, the source says, the technology basically removed the need for the human gatekeeper. So what's the common thread the sources pull out from all these examples, connecting them to AI now? Well, they argue that any profession, really, whose core value relies on having exclusive access to codified knowledge or repeatable process, is inherently vulnerable. If you know something specific or can do a specific repeatable thing really well. That others can't easily access or do, yeah. Yeah. That's the potential vulnerability. And here's the really sharp, maybe counterintuitive point the source material makes. Go on. Prestige does not protect it. Ah. So being seen as elite isn't a shield. Not only that, the sources actually suggest prestige might be the opposite. It could be a signal of vulnerability. How so? Well, the argument goes like this. When a profession's knowledge and methods become so well understood, so standardized, so respected that they achieve that prestige, they've basically created the perfect conditions for automation. They've defined the rules so clearly. If something is teachable and can be written down into rules or processes codified, then a machine can potentially learn it. And if a machine can learn it and do it efficiently. Then parts of that prestigious role become replaceable. Which leads right into this concept the sources call the high skill trap. Okay, the high skill trap. What's the trap? It's deeply ironic, according to the sources. Think about it. These elite fields, law, medicine, finance, consulting, estate, they've spent decades doing what? Standardizing things. Best practices, performance benchmarks. Exactly. Standardizing best practices, benchmarking performance, reducing errors through systematic frameworks. All that effort to refine and codify their expertise, make it more reliable, more teachable. Right. Seems like a good thing. It was. But the source argues it's that very work, that systematization, that now makes them prime targets for AI. They've inadvertently drawn the blueprint that AI can now follow. They mapped out their own disruption. Wow. Okay, let's get more specific then. The sources mention examples beyond that lawyer, Sterling. What about in law more generally? Yeah, they definitely do. They talk about big global firms like Allen & Overy integrating AI called Harvey, which is apparently based on GPT-4. And Harvey isn't just like a glorified search engine. The sources say it can draft complex legal documents, summarize huge volumes of text, do sophisticated research. Tasks that traditionally... Justified hiring, as the source puts it, armies of junior associates. And then there are tools already widely used, like Kira Systems or Luminance for contract review. They use machine learning to tear through documents way faster than humans can. Okay, so law is clearly feeling it. What about medicine? Similar patterns. The sources discuss Google's MedPalm M2 being tested in places like the Mayo Clinic. Apparently it's getting really good at answering complex medical questions, sometimes performing on par with human experts in tests. Impressive. But is it changing roles yet? Well, the sources highlight radiology as a key example. The traditional role of the radiologist as the sole interpreter of, say, an MRI or CT scan, that's shifting. How so? The sources describe it as becoming more of a partner with an AI. The AI isn't just double-checking, it's designed to spot things humans might miss. Like what? The sources mention detecting subtle early-stage disease patterns that might be invisible even to a trained human eye. AI can see the unseen, as they put it. That fundamentally changes the diagnostic process and what it means to be an expert radiologist. That's a huge shift. And they also mentioned AI chatbots. Right. Companies like Babylon Health using AI for initial diagnostic interactions. Handling millions of them, apparently. That takes away a lot of the routine work GPs used to do. Okay, law, medicine, what about finance? Well, finance has used complex algorithms for ages, right? The sources mention BlackRock's Aladdin platform as a prime example. But now, they're layering generative AI on top of these systems. To do what? Things like enhancing risk modeling, automatically generating detailed report summaries from raw data, even drafting initial investment ideas or theses for analysts to review. Again, automating tasks that used to take up a lot of human time. So across all these fields, law, medicine, finance, the common theme the sources keep coming back to is it's not total replacement, not yet anyway. Exactly. It is, and this is the key phrase from the sources, unbundling them. Unbundling. Piece by piece. AI is identifying and taking over specific tasks within these professions, usually the repeatable, data-heavy ones. The tasks that, frankly, generate a lot of the billable hours and form the economic bed
