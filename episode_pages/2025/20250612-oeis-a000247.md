## Description

Learn about OEIS A000247

## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today, we're plunging into the incredible world of the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS. If you think of it as like the ultimate library or dictionary for numbers and sequences, you're definitely on the right track. Absolutely. Well, it's a treasure trove. And today we're pulling up a specific entry, A000247. That's going to be our map for this exploration. This is part of our ongoing series where we pick a sequence from the OEIS and just see where it takes us. It's particularly relevant if you're studying number theory, but honestly, it's fascinating for anyone who just loves finding patterns and, you know, unexpected connections in math. It really is. For a mathematician, the OEIS is often the very first place you go when you stumble upon a sequence of numbers in your work. Oh, yeah. Definitely. Whether it's from a calculation, maybe a computer simulation, or some kind of combinatorial problem, you just plug in the first few terms. And hope for a match. Exactly. And if it's in the database, boom, you instantly get linked to pretty much everything known about it. It's amazing how it connects researchers who might be working on problems that seem totally unrelated. So our mission with this deep dive is to unpack the sequence A000247. The formula given is A n equals 2n n2. We want to figure out, you know, what this sequence is, how it starts, and explore some of the really surprising places these numbers pop up across different areas of math and maybe even beyond. And everything we'll talk about comes straight from the source, the OEIS entry itself, the comments, the formulas, the connections listed right there. Okay, let's get straight to it then. The definition. Right, so it's explicitly given, A n equals 2n n2. It's a mix, you see, an exponential part that's the second, and then these simple linear bits, the i n n and the nagus 2. Okay, that formula looks straightforward enough, but where does it actually start? The OEIS entries always specify an offset, right? To tell you the index. They do, yes, and it's crucial. You have to know where you're starting. For A000247, the entry lists the offset as 2, 1, 2. 2 back, 2. Which means the sequence is typically indexed starting at n2. Some sequences start at n0 or n1, but for this one, we kick things off with n2. Got it. So the very first term corresponds to n2. If we plug that into the formula, let's see, A2, it's q squared, 2, 2, that's 4, 4, which is 0. Correct. And the OEIS entry does indeed list the sequence starting with 0. Okay, and the next one, n3? For n3, we have A3 equals 2 cubed, 3, 2. That's 8, 5, which gives us 3. Right, and the sequence goes on. A4 would be 2 to the 4th, that's 16, minus 4, minus 2, so 16, 6 is 10. Exactly. Then A5 is 2 to the 5th, 32, minus 5, minus 2, that's 32, 7, 25. So the sequence starts 0, 3, 10, 25. The next ones listed are 56, 119, 246, 501. Okay, so it starts off pretty small with that 0, but then it grows reasonably quickly. That tuck-in term really takes over. Precisely. The exponential growth dominates pretty fast. But, you know, the initial terms might not look like much on their own. Where the OEIS entry gets really interesting is the comments section. Ah, yes, that's where the context comes in. Exactly. This is where researchers contribute their findings about where this specific sequence shows up. Maybe as the answer to some counting problem or describing the structure of some mathematical object. And these connections are often incredibly diverse, aren't they? Like, they span areas of math you wouldn't normally think are related at all. But that's the magic of it. It's like finding the same hidden pattern appearing in completely different puzzles. So one of the first combinatorial interpretations listed for A000247 is that An counts the ways of placing n plus 1 labeled balls into 2 indistinguishable boxes. Okay, hold on. Let's unpack that a bit. Labeled balls. This means each ball is distinct. Ball 1, ball 2, up to ball n plus 1. You can tell them apart. Right, and indistinguishable boxes. That means the boxes themselves don't have labels. Putting balls 1 day on the first box and 3, 4 on the second is the same outcome as putting 3, 4 on the first and 1 to the second. The order of the boxes doesn't matter. Okay, and the constraint. With at least 2 balls in each box. That's the key part. Ah, so you can't have an empty box and you can't have a box with just one ball either. Right, and you're essentially partitioning a set of n plus 1 distinct items into exactly 2 groups or subsets. And each group has to have at least 2 items in it. And since the boxes are indistinguishable, the order of the 2 groups doesn't matter. Okay, so it counts a specific way of sorting things that feels like classic combinatorics. But then the entry jumps somewhere else entirely permutations. It does. It says An is the number of permutations avoiding 13 to 2 that contain the pattern 23 to 1 exactly twice. Whoa. Okay, permutation patterns. Let's break that down. A permutation is just an arrangement of numbers. Like 3, 12 is a permutation of 1, 2, 3. Correct. And a pattern refers to the relative order of elements within the permutation. So what does 13 to 2 mean as a pattern and avoiding it? Think of 13 to 2 describing 3 numbers in your permutation, let's call them x, y, z, that appear in that order, x, y, z, but not necessarily next to each other. The pattern means x, z, y. So the first is the smallest, the third is the largest, and the second is in the middle value-wise. Okay, like in 4, 1, 5, 2, the subsequent 4, 5, 2, 4 is the 1, 5 is the 3, 2 is the 2. Exactly. That contains the 13 to 2 pattern. A permutation avoids 13 to 2 if it has no subsequence with that relative order. Got it. So A000247 counts permutations that do avoid that 13 to 2 pattern, but they must contain another specific pattern, 23 to 1, exactly two times. Right, and the 23 to 1 pattern means you have three elements, x, y, z, where y is the largest, z is the smallest, and x is in the middle, value-wise, z, x, y. So it's a very specific counting problem within this niche field of permutation pattern. It is, and the fact that the same number 0, 3, 10, 25 pop up here as counted the ways to put balls in boxes, well, that's already a hint that there's some deep, maybe not obvious, connections happening. And it doesn't stop there, does it? The entry mentions computer science, too, something about Huffman trees. Yes, Huffman trees used in data compression. Yeah. The entry connects A000247 to the cost of ternary maximum height Huffman tree with n internal nodes for minimizing absolutely ordered sequences of size n equals 2n plus 1. Okay, Huffman coding. That's about efficient ways to represent data, often based on frequency. Builds a tree structure. Usually binary tree, yes. But this refers to a ternary Huffman tree, three branches from each internal node instead of two. And it's a specific kind, maximum height. And the sequence relates to a cost associated with arranging certain sequences using this specific tree structure. So these numbers, 0, 3, 10, also measure some kind of cost or efficiency related to a particular data structure in computing. That's what the entry suggests, yeah. It's another link, this time from combinatorics and number theory into algorithms and data structures. Okay, labeled balls, permutation patterns, Huffman tree costs, and then it mentions Dick paths. That sounds like another combinatorial object. It is, classic combinatorics. The entry says An is the number of Dick-N paths whose third upstep initiates the last long ascent for n equals 1. It even defines long ascent as two or more consecutive upsteps. Dick paths, right. Those are grid paths from 0, 0 using up and down steps, staying above the axis, ending back on the axis. U-D, U-D-U-D are examples for n to it. Exactly. An N path has N upsteps, U, and N downsteps, D. Okay, now this condition, whose third upstep initiates the last long ascent. An upstep is a U, a long ascent is U-U or U-U, et cetera. Right, two or more uss in a row. So you look at the path, you find the third U step. Does it start the last run of two or more uss in the whole path? If yes, you count it. Precisely. It's a very specific structural property of the path. The entry gives examples for A3, 3. They are U-D-U-D-U
