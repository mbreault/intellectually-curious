## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today we're looking at something you might see all the time but maybe haven't thought much about. The American wire gauge system, AWG. That's right. It's the standard way electrical wires are sized, mostly in North America. Been around since, what, 1857? Yeah, a long time. And it's for round, solid, non-ferrous conducting wire. Basically not iron. Exactly. And the key thing really is the cross-sectional area. That dictates how much current the wire can handle safely. ASTM B258 defines the details. And this fits right into our mathematics series because, well, there's more math here than you might expect. Oh, absolutely. It's not just arbitrary numbers. There's a logarithmic structure, a geometric progression. It's quite elegant, mathematically speaking. So that's our mission today, folks, to kind of unpack the math behind AWG, understand its principles, and see those surprising connections. It's like a shortcut to really getting it. And to help us navigate this, we're thrilled to have a Fields Medal-winning mathematician with us today. Welcome. Thank you. Glad to be here. It's a fascinating intersection of the practical and the mathematical. Great. So let's start with the history. Where did these AWG numbers even come from? It wasn't just random, you said. No, not at all. The numbers originally related directly to the manufacturing process. How so? Well, the gauge number basically corresponded to the number of times the wire had to be drawn through a die to get to that thickness. Ah, okay. So pulling it to make it thinner. Exactly. So a really fine wire, like, say, 38 AWG, that needed a lot more drawing steps, more passes, than a thick wire like 0 AWG. Makes sense. More work for the thinner stuff. And I guess before AWG, it was kind of the Wild West for wire sizes? It really was. Different manufacturers had their own systems. Imagine the confusion, you know, trying to match wires or figure out what you actually needed. Yeah, standardization was definitely key. Absolutely. Systems like AWG brought much-needed order. Now, the outline mentions the Brown and Sharp gauge for sheet metal being similar. How does that fit in? Yeah, B&S. It actually uses the same mathematical basis, the same geometric progression. So the gauge numbers line up, functionally speaking. But B&S is for sheet metal. AWG is for wire. Technically, yes. B&S came first, focused on sheet metal. AWG adopted that mathematical structure specifically for electrical wire. It was about precision for electrical use. Okay, that clears that up. So let's get into that math. You mentioned logarithmic stepping. What does that mean in practice? It means that as the gauge number goes up, the wire diameter gets smaller by a consistent ratio, not a fixed amount. Like percentages rather than fixed steps. Exactly. Think of it like compound interest, maybe. Each step is a multiplication. It's different from, say, the metric system, IEC 60228, which just uses the area in square millimeters directly. Right, a totally different philosophy. So what are the anchor points for AWG? How is it defined? It's pinned down by two specific sizes. 36 AWG is defined as having a diameter of exactly 0.0005 inches. Okay, tiny. And 0.0000G, which people often call 4-0 or 40, that's defined as 0.46 inches in diameter. So those two points define the whole scale. Pretty much. They set the boundaries for the mathematical relationship. And how many sizes are there between those two? There are 40 gauge sizes in total, from 36 up to 40, which means there are 39 steps between them. Okay, 39 steps. And this is where the geometric progression comes in. That sounds important. It is. It's the core idea. Because you have these 39 steps between the defined diameters, the diameter changes by the same multiplicative factor at each step. A constant ratio. Exactly. The ratio between the diameter of any gauge and the next one is constant. And that constant is the 39th root of the ratio of the biggest diameter to the smallest. Which is? 0.46 inches divided by 0.0005 inches. Right, which equals 92. So the magic number, the ratio between successive gauge diameters, is the 39th root of 92. And what does that work out to? It's approximately 1.12293. Okay, not a round number, but a very specific one. Very specific. So to go from one gauge diameter to the next higher gauge number, thinner wire, you divide by about 1.12293. You go to the next lower number, thicker wire, you multiply. And if wires are, say, n steps apart in gauge? Then the ratio of their diameters is that number, 1.12293, raised to the power of n. It's this consistent mathematical relationship that makes the system predictable. That's really neat. So this leads to a formula, I assume, to calculate the diameter for any AWG size. Yes, absolutely. If n is the AWG size, the diameter, let's call it dn, in inches, is dn.0059236n39. Right, using the 0.005 inch diameter of 36 AWG as the base. Exactly. And in millimeters, it's dn.12792.3639. And that exponent, 36n39, that's basically counting how many steps you are away from gauge 36. Precisely. It positions the gauge within that geometric progression based on the 39 steps. What about the sizes bigger than AWG, like 00AWG? How does n work there? Good question. We use negative numbers for n. So 00000N AWG is n of 0. Then 00000N AWG is n of 00. 00000BWG. It keeps the formula consistent. Got it. The outline also mentioned an exponential formula. Is that just another way to write it? Yeah, it's mathematically equivalent. Using the natural logarithm base e, sometimes more convenient, looks like dn equals e, another constant n, same result, different form. Two ways to get the same answer, shows the underlying structure like you said. Exactly. And can you go the other way? Calculate the AWG number from the diameter? You can. It involves using logarithms, specifically log base 92. The formula is n equals 39, log 92, dn's .005 inch plus 36. Okay, maybe not one you do in your head, but the relationship exists. Right, it shows how diameter directly maps back to the gauge number through that base 92 logarithmic scale. Now let's talk area. Cross-sectional area is critical for current, right? How does that relate? Well, area is proportional to the diameter squared. A equals pi for d2. Simple geometry. Right, so if you plug our diameter formula into that, you get a formula for area n based on the AWG number n. And does it still involve that 92-something term? It does, because the diameter involves 92, 36n, 36n39. Squaring that means the area involves 36 and 19.5. Notice the denominator is halved from 39 to 19.5 because of the squaring. Ah, makes sense. Math follows through. And the ASTM B258 standard that just formalizes all this. Yes, that's the official document. It specifies that exact ratio, the 39th root of 92, to several decimal places, about 1.1229322, and sets rules for how precise the diameters need to be in tables and such. Okay, so we have this precise mathematical system, but then there are these rules of thumb. Are these just handy shortcuts people figured out? They are, and they work because of some convenient mathematical approximations that stem from that core ratio. Like what? Give us some examples. Okay, a really useful one involves area, because the sixth power of that ratio, 1.12296, is very, very close to 2. Right. It means that decreasing the AWG number by 3 roughly doubles the cross-sectional area. Doubles the area. So like two 14 AWG wires have about the same area as one 11 AWG wire. Exactly that, which also means you roughly double the current capacity, the conductance. That is handy. Wow. Okay, what's another one? Related to diameter. Since decreasing AWG by 3 doubles the area, and area goes with diameter squared, if you decrease the AWG by 6, you roughly double the diameter. Six steps doubles the diameter. Approximately, yes. Which means you quadruple the area and conductance. So going from, say, 14 AWG down to 8 AWG. These are great mental shortcuts anymore. There's one for bigger jumps. A decrease of 10 gauge numbers, like going from 20 AWG down to 10 AWG, multiplies the area, weight, and conductance by roughly 10 times. A factor of 10 for 10 gauge steps? That seems elegant. It is. It's a direct consequence of the logarithmic scale. 10 steps of multiplying by about 1.26, the area ratio per step, gets you very close to a factor of 10 overall. Amazing how that works out. What about resistance? Any rules of thumb there, specifically for copper? Yeah, for copper wire, there are some useful approximations. 10 AWG copper wire is conveniently about 1 ohm per 1,000 feet. Okay, 10 gauge, 1 ohm per 1,000 feet. Easy baseline. Right. And then because
