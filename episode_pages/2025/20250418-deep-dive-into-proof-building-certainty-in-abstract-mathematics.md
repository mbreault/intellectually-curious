## Description

An accessible tour through the grammar of mathematical certainty. We move from propositions and logical connectives to universal quantifiers, exploring how proofs distinguish theorems from conjectures, the power of counterexamples, and practical steps for planning and writing rigorous proofsâ€”drawing on material from UCI's Math 13 to show how calculation-led math becomes abstract, logical reasoning.

## Transcript

Welcome to the deep dive. Today we're taking a foundational journey, really getting into proof and abstract mathematics. Yeah, it's about understanding the sort of grammar of mathematical certainty, how mathematicians build truths that are absolutely solid. Right. And we're using material from Math 13, an introduction to abstract mathematics at UCI, which sounds like it's designed as a bridge. Exactly. It's meant to take you from maybe more calculation-focused math into the world of abstract thought, rigorous proof. It's quite a shift. And the cool thing is you don't need a deep background in calculus or linear algebra, apparently. Not assumed. So it's pretty accessible, you know, even if your technical background varies. It's about the way of thinking. So if you've ever wondered why math rules work, or maybe you want a solid base before hitting heavier topics, this should be helpful. Our mission really is to demystify this core idea of proof and the language that goes with it, give you a good starting point. Okay, so let's start right there. Proof. It sounds simple, but in math it's a very specific, heavy term, isn't it? Oh, absolutely. Look, in everyday talk, proof can mean, you know, evidence, a good argument, something convincing. Like in a trial or something. Right. But in mathematics, a proof is definitive. It's a logical argument that just completely unequivocally establishes that a statement is true. Leaves zero room for doubt. Wow. So it's not about, like, gathering lots of evidence that points towards something being true, like in science maybe? No, not probability. It's aiming for 100% certainty. Black and white. Okay. And these proven statements, they have a name. We call them theorems. Once something is proven, it becomes a theorem. Part of the established knowledge. It's the foundation we build on. And what about ideas that aren't proven yet? Those are conjectures. Statements we suspect are true, maybe based on patterns, intuition, but lacking that rigorous proof. So math isn't static. It's about chasing these conjectures. Very much so. Trying to prove or disprove conjectures, that's where a lot of the action is. It's how new mathematics often gets discovered. It's a creative process. The notes give a couple examples. Conjecture 1.3. If n is any odd integer, then nn1 is a multiple of 8. And conjecture 1.4. If n is any positive integer, then n plus n plus 41 is prime. How do you even start with those? Well, often you just play. Try some numbers, see if it holds up for small cases. Okay, so for the first one, odd integers. n1 gives 0, n3 gives 8, and n5 does 24. Yeah, those are all multiples of 8. Looks promising, right? And for the other one, n plus n plus n plus 41. Try n1, you get 43, prime. n2 gives 47, prime. And 3 gives 53, prime. Keeps working. Yeah, you try a few more, maybe up to n7, and you get 61, 71, 83, 97. All prime. You start to think, huh, maybe this is always true. But that's the trap, isn't it? Seeing a pattern in a few cases doesn't mean it holds forever. Exactly. That is the critical point. To prove something holds for all integers or all odd numbers, you need a general argument. Logic that covers every single possibility. Not just examples. Examples can build intuition, suggest ideas, but they never constitute a proof for a universal statement. But they could disprove one. Ah, right. If you find just one case where it fails. That's it. Game over for the conjecture. That single failure is called a counterexample. It's incredibly powerful for disproving things claimed to be universally true. And that's what happens with that prime number conjecture, the n plus n plus 41 one? It is. It's a famous one because it holds up for a surprisingly long time. Works all the way from n1 up to n39. Wow, 39 times in a row. Yep. Seems really solid. But then you hit n40. Let's see. 40 squared is 1600 plus 40 is 1640 plus 41 is 1681. And 1681 turns out it's 41 times 41. So not prime. Ah, so n40 is the counterexample. Wait, the notes say n41. Oh, right. Sorry, my mistake. Let's check n41. You get 41 plus 41 plus 41. You can factor out 41, right? So it's 41, 41 plus 1, which is 41, 43. Definitely not prime. Definitely not. So n41 is the counterexample. After holding true for so many cases, it fails. One counterexample is all it takes. Conjecture disproven. It really shows why you need actual proof, not just observation. What about the other one, conjecture 1.3, about not 1 for odd n. Is that true? That one, as it turns out, is true. But again, the examples we checked aren't enough. We need a formal proof, a logical argument showing it works for any odd n. Which brings us to actually planning and writing proofs. It's a skill, yeah, not just automatic. Oh, absolutely a skill. Takes practice. The notes suggest a process. First step, really interpret the statement. Understand what it's truly claiming. Exactly. Rephrase it. What are the assumptions? What's the conclusion? What's the logical link supposed to be? Dissect it, basically. Makes sense. Break it down first. Then what? Then brainstorm. Try to convince yourself it's true. Why should it be true? Look up definitions. Try more examples. Maybe edge cases. See if that gives you an idea of strategy. So explore, play around, build some intuition. Right. And maybe think about related theorems you already know. Could they help? It's about getting a feel for the problem's landscape. And to navigate that landscape, we need the right tools, which is where logic comes in. Precisely. Logic is the language of proof. The rules of the game. Okay, so what are the building blocks? It starts with propositions. Simple, declarative statements. Things that are definitely true or definitely false. Seven is prime, true. Paris is in Spain, false. Got it. True or false statement. Then you combine or modify them using logical connectives. And, E, or, not T. The conditional, if then. And the biconditional, if and only if. And they have those symbols, like the wedge for and D, the V for or R, the hook for not. Right, true implies and for if and only if. Using symbols keeps it precise. And their meanings are nailed down by truth tables. Truth tables show how the truth of the combined statement depends on the truth of the parts. Exactly, for every possible combination. So P and DQ is true only if P and Q are both true. P or RQ is true if at least one of them is true. Very systematic. No ambiguity. None. And from these, you get things like tautologies, statements that are always true, like P or not P. Right. And contradictions always false, like P and not P, fundamental logical laws. Okay. The notes really emphasize the conditional one, P implies Q, QHQ. Why is it so central to theorems? Because so many theorems have that structure. If something, the hypothesis P, then something else, the conclusion Q. If N is even, then N squared is even. That's a classic P implies Q. And related to P, Q are the converse and contrapositive. Crucial concepts. The converse is Q, Q, just flip it. The contrapositive is Q, QP, negate both parts and flip it. And the key thing is, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. P, Q is true if and only if Q, Q is true. They stand or fall together. But the converse isn't necessarily equivalent. Nope. If it's raining, P, then the ground is wet. Q is true. But if the ground is wet, Q, then it's raining. P isn't always true. Maybe sprinklers were on. Right. The truth table in the notes shows that equivalence with the contrapositive, clearly. It also warns about negating conditionals. Negating if P, then Q isn't if P, then not Q or something. Correct. That's a common mistake. The negation of P, Q is actually P, C, Q. It means P is true and Q is false. The example is about rain and umbrellas. Yeah. Negating if it's raining, I take my umbrella. If it's raining, I don't take my umbrella. It's is raining and I don't take my umbrella. That's the scenario that makes the original if-then statement false. That makes perfect sense. Okay, so moving on from basic propositions. Propositional functions and quantifiers. Right. A propositional function has variables, like P, X could be by five. It's not true or false until you plug in a value for X. Okay. Quantifiers. Let's talk about these functions over ranges of values. The universal quantifier, A, means for all. The existential quantifier, A, means there exists. So AX in the set of integers, X sores 0, 0. That means for all integers X, X squared is non-negative. True. Exactly. Or A in the integers such that X os equals 4. There exists an integer X whose square is 4. Also true, X 2 or X 2
