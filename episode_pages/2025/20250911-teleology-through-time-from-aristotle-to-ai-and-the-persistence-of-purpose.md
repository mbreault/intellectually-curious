## Description

We trace the stubborn staying power of teleologyâ€”from Aristotleâ€™s four causes to modern biologyâ€™s teleonomy, with stops in physics and the AI frontier. This deep dive asks how purpose stays embedded in science, even as Darwin reshaped biology, and what it means for meaning when intelligent machines pursue goals. A conversation about whether purpose is a relic or a fundamental layer of realityâ€”and the questions future minds will force us to answer.

## Transcript

Welcome back. You'd think some ideas are just, well, ancient history, right? Relics. But what if one of the oldest philosophical concepts is actually still shaping how we understand, well, everything? From the very building blocks of life to the cutting edge of artificial intelligence. That's exactly what we're looking at today. Today we're doing a deep dive into teleology. It's this really profound ancient idea of explaining things by their ultimate purpose, their goal. Precisely. Teleology, it comes from the Greek telos. That means end or aim, goal, and logos, which is explanation. So yeah, we're exploring the for the sake of what behind things, not just the immediate push or pull cause. And our mission today really is to trace this surprisingly persistent concept, see how it's journeyed from philosophy right into, well, modern science and maybe even beyond. Right. And to really get a handle on this, I think we have to start with Aristotle. He laid out these, what, four archei, his types of explanation? That's the place to start. Absolutely. And the one that really grabs this idea of purpose is the final cause. Yes. In his posterior analytics, Aristotle, he argued that real scientific knowledge, it demands we understand why things are the way they are, not just that they are. Okay, the why. Exactly. And he saw all four explanations, you know, the formal, material, efficient, and final as being sort of brought out through what he called the middle term in a logical demonstration. The middle term. Think about his example, walking after dinner for your health. The overall explanation, it's teleological, it's for the sake of health. Makes sense. But the middle term, the thing that shows how you get that health might be something more, let's say, mechanical or material, like the food not floating, helping digestion. Ah, okay. So the how isn't necessarily the ultimate why. Exactly. And what's crucial here is his distinction between tuafitation, that's like the specific cause or the agent responsible, the doer, and haecia, which is the broader causal account, the whole story, including the purpose. Right, the bigger picture explanation. Precisely. So an explanation, haecia, can be fundamentally teleological, focus on the goal, even if the immediate trigger to itiation is material or efficient. That makes a lot of sense for philosophy back then. But, you know, fast forward, it's really easy to think Darwin just completely knocked out any idea of purpose in biology. That's the common assumption, yeah. But you're saying it actually persists, it's still kind of core. Yeah. How does that work? It's a really key point and a great question. Because while, yes, the sort of 19th century theological ideas of purpose were largely rejected after Darwin, teleological notions, ways of thinking about purpose seem pretty much ineliminable from modern biological sciences. I mean, think about it. When we talk about an organ's function... We're talking purpose. We're talking purpose, what's it for? Now, people like Ernst Mayer, they highlighted the worries. Was teleology vitalistic, implying some weird life force? Did it need backwards causation, like the future goal pulling the present? Or was it just incompatible with good old mechanistic explanation? Yeah, all big problems for science. Definitely. But the, I think, elegant solution many biologists landed on was this idea of teleonomy. Colin Pimbrae coined the term. Teleonomy. It describes adapted, goal-directed systems. And crucially, it tries to naturalize purpose. It grounds it right in natural selection. So purpose comes from evolution, not some grand design. Essentially, yes. A heart pumping blood, that's a genuine biological function. Because that trait helped ancestors survive and reproduce. It contributes to the organism's persistence. It's not like your nose, you know, accidentally holding up your glasses. That's just utility, not its evolved function. Got it. Function via selection. Okay, I'm genuinely fascinated by this next bit, though. Physics, that seems like the last place you'd find teleology. We've said causes before effects, right? Absolutely. That's the standard view. Causes precede effects. Full stop. So are there any whispers of purpose there? Even hints? Well, surprisingly, yes. There are some, let's say, non-mainstream interpretations. In quantum physics, for example, John Kramer's transactional interpretation kind of plays with how future conditions might be needed for consistency with the present. Or David Deutsch's constructor theory. It frames laws of nature fundamentally around what transformations are possible, what can be built. That has a sort of teleological flavor, a focus on potential outcomes. And AI, where does that fit? Ah, AI. Now that's interesting because our very creation of AI is, I mean, it's an act of clear, intelligent agency, right? We build these things for a purpose. We give them goals. Extrinsic goals. Exactly, extrinsic goal-directedness. And, you know, this development weirdly mirrors some arguments you hear about, say, intelligent design in biology. The idea that complex functional systems seem to imply a guiding mind. I see the parallel. Philosophically, maybe someone like Hegel offers a middle ground with his imminent teleology. The idea that purpose isn't just slapped on from outside, nor is it purely random chance. But it sort of emerges organically from the rational structure of reality itself. You could maybe see AI as a kind of new dialectical stage, the universe unfolding its purpose with human minds as the vehicle this time. Okay, wow. That takes us into some deep territory. And here's where it gets really interesting, I think. Thinking about all this, what new questions should we be asking? Especially about purpose and meaning now that we see intelligence potentially evolving in, well, artificial forms. That's the big question, isn't it? Could this drive we see, this push towards self-awareness, whether it happens in organic life over eons or, you know, through our own technological creations, could that itself be a reflection, maybe of a deeper inherent purpose that's sort of woven into reality itself, always unfolding?
