## Transcript

Okay, so you're here because you really want to get to the bottom of things, right? You want the real story. You want the knowledge. You don't want to wade through all the extra stuff. That's it. That's exactly what we aim for, to cut through the noise and bring you the key insights. And today we're tackling a topic. Well, it's heavy. It's the 1955 Le Mans disaster. It's the worst crash in motorsport history, you know, still to this day. And we really want to understand what happened, not just, you know, what happened on the surface, but like the chain of events. How did this happen? And what changed because of it? Right. This wasn't just a racing accident. It was a pivotal moment that reshaped the entire sport. So we dug into a lot of sources, eyewitness accounts, historical reports, investigations. It's a lot to unpack, but the story it tells is crucial. Absolutely. So picture this. It's June 1955, the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The atmosphere is electric. You've got these huge names in racing. You've got Ferrari. They were the defending champs, known for being crazy fast, but sometimes, you know, not always finishing the race. Right. They definitely had the speed, but could they keep it up for a full 24 hours? That was always the question with Ferrari. And then you have Jaguar. Now, Le Mans, this was their thing. This was what they were all about. Their whole racing program was built around winning this race. And they had this driver, Mike Hawthorne, a super talented guy competing in Formula One at the same time. That's serious dedication. Oh, yeah. Having Hawthorne on the team definitely added to the drama. He was a fierce competitor, and that made the rivalry even more intense. Then you've got Mercedes-Benz. Now, they were fresh off a bunch of big wins, you know, in the World Sports Car Championship. And their car, the 300 SLR, this thing was a masterpiece. Sterling Moss even set a record in it at the Mille Miglia. I mean, it was so innovative, incredibly lightweight body. They called the alloy electron magnesium alloy. And this is important. They used inboard drum brakes, which were common back then. And they had this huge air brake that came up behind the driver. Yeah, very different from Jaguar, who had these advanced disc brakes. Exactly. And, you know, just for everyone listening, disc brakes are what we have in cars today. They squeeze pads against a rotor, which creates friction and stops the car way faster, much better than those old drum brakes, especially when you're braking hard over and over. And as we'll see, that difference in braking technology played a big part in what happened. Now, heading to the Mercedes team, you had Alfred Neubauer. This guy was legendary. He put together this all-star team of drivers, Fangio, Sterling Moss. These guys were icons. And you had Carl Kleng. He'd won Le Mans back in 52. He was paired with Andre Simon. And then John Fitch and Pierre Leve, the American duo. And Leve, he had this amazing history of Le Mans. Back in 52, he almost single-handedly won it for Mercedes. An incredible drive just fell short in the final hour. Yeah, and his performance in 52 was something else. It really showed his determination and how much Mercedes wanted to win Le Mans. It set the stage for what was to come. So let's talk about the track. Circuit de la Sarthe. Now, back then, parts of it hadn't changed that much from, like, the 1920s, you know, when the fastest cars were doing maybe 100 kilometers per hour. But by 55, these cars were flying over 270 kilometers per hour. I mean, it's a huge difference. And that's where things get a bit scary. The cars were evolving so rapidly, but the safety measures on these tracks, they were lagging behind. Yeah, they did some resurfacing. They widened some parts after the war. But the basic layout, and most importantly, the safety features, they were still pretty basic. No barriers separating the pits from the track. Just a four-foot dirt bank for the spectators. And get this. No seatbelts in the cars. Back then, the thinking was that if you crashed, you were better off being thrown clear. Can you imagine that today? It's a different world. It really highlights how much our understanding of safety has changed. Back then, it was all about the driver's skill and accepting the risk. Okay, so the race starts. It's four in the afternoon. And right off the bat, it's intense. Castellotti in the Ferrari, Hawthorne in the Jaguar, Fangio in the Mercedes. They're all going at it, breaking lap records left and right. It's a crazy battle. The other cars from their teams are being a bit more cautious, pacing themselves. Right, a 24-hour race is all about strategy. You can't just go flat out the whole time. Then it's 6.26 p.m. The leaders are finishing lap 35. They're coming up on the first pit stops. And that's when everything went wrong. It's like a perfect storm of factors all colliding at once. A tragic chain of events. High speeds, the track design, and a series of decisions all happening in a split second. Okay, so let's break it down. Hawthorne, he's just passed Leves and he's closing in on Lance Macklin, who's in an Austin Healey. Hawthorne's team signals for him to pit at the end of the lap. So he passes Macklin, moves to the right, getting ready to pit, and then slams on the brakes. Those Jaguar disc brakes, they really stopped him fast. And Macklin, right behind him, he's caught completely off guard. Totally. He slams on his brakes, swerves right, goes off the track, onto the dirt, kicks up a huge cloud of dust, and then he swerves back left. Now, there's a few theories about why he swerved left. Maybe it was instinctive. Maybe he lost control on the dirt. Maybe the disc brakes on the Austin Healey acted up a little. We don't know for sure. But that swerve put him right in the path of Leves' Mercedes. And Leves was coming up fast, about to lap Macklin again, going over 200 kilometers per hour. It was a recipe for disaster. At that speed, there was almost no time to react. No time at all. Leves' Mercedes slams into the back of Macklin's car. People who saw it, and later analysis, they all say the Austin Healey basically acted like a ramp. It launched the Mercedes straight up into the air. There were even reports that Leves, as his car was going up, raised his hand. Maybe a warning to Fangio, who was right behind him in the other Mercedes. And that might have saved Fangio's life. He somehow managed to thread the needle through all the chaos, even clipped Hawthorne's Jaguar as he went by. Fangio was one of the greatest drivers ever. His ability to react in that situation was incredible. But tragically, Leves wasn't so lucky. No, he wasn't. His car went flying over that little dirt bank right into the crowd. At over 200 kilometers an hour. Hit the spectators at least twice. The force was so great, the Mercedes completely disintegrated. Leves was thrown from the car, died instantly. It was horrific. And all those pieces of the car, the engine, the suspension, even the hood, they were all flung into the crowd. They say the hood was like a guillotine. People were standing on ladders, scaffolding, anything to get a better view. It was just awful. It's hard to even comprehend the chaos and the sheer terror of that moment. The lack of proper barriers was devastating. Jaguar driver Duncan Hamilton. He was standing in the pit wall, right? He said the scene across the track was indescribable. Just death and suffering everywhere. Screams. He couldn't even process it. And, you know, it didn't stop there. Leves' car landed on the embankment. The fuel tank ruptured and the whole thing exploded. The magnesium body, that electron stuff, it burned incredibly hot. White hot. And then when the firefighters tried to put it out with water, it made it worse. Magnesium reacts violently with water. It burned for hours. Just a horrible sight. It's a grim reminder of how even the most basic firefighting methods can be completely ineffective, even dangerous in certain situations. Meanwhile, Macklin's car is bouncing off everything. Hits the left barrier, spins across the track, straight into the pit lane. Almost takes out a bunch of cars that are refueling. Carl Klain's Mercedes, a Maserati, another Jaguar. Crashes into the pit wall, barely misses the Cunningham and Mercedes pit crews, but still injures a policeman, a photographer, two officials. Bounces back across the track. And somehow, Macklin walks away from it. Not a scratch on him. Incredible. Talk about a lucky escape. It shows how unpredictable these crashes can be. Right. And Hawthorne, well, he missed his pit entry with everything going on. His team waved him around to do another lap, get him away from the mess. When he finally pitted, he was a wreck. He thought he'd caused the whole thing. Couldn't even continue driving. Buev and Deuss, his teammates, they had to take over. It's hard to imagine the psychological toll that took on the drivers. To witness something like that, it must have been incredibly traumatic. And John Fitch, Leve's co-driver. He was standing there, ready to
