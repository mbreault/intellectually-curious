## Description

Explore A000243, the count of unrooted trees on n nodes with two distinct labeled vertices. Weâ€™ll cover the offset (n=2 corresponds to 1) and the early terms (1, 3, 9, 26, 75, 214, â€¦), its connections to rooted trees and the broader A034799 table, and the multiple formulas and generating-function viewpoints that explain how these numbers are built. Weâ€™ll also touch on the historical contextâ€”from Sloan to Riordanâ€”and note the surprising crosslinks, such as a match with counts of non-intersecting circles in the plane, illustrating how a single sequence sits at the crossroads of different combinatorial ideas.

## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today we're heading back into the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS. Yes, and we're focusing on one that should be particularly interesting for number theory students or anyone fascinated by combinatoric. We've got the source material for sequence A000243 right here. And our goal, as always, is to really unpack it, the definition, the numbers themselves, its connections, formulas, all of that based on what the OEIS entry tells us. Okay, so let's jump right in. A000243, what's it counting? The source defines it clearly. It's the number of trees with n nodes, two of which are labeled. Trees, graph theory trees, right? Connected, no cycles. Exactly. And we pick two nodes, two points on that tree, and give them distinct labels like 1 and 2 or start and finish. That's the idea. The labels matter. Labeling node XA and node YB is different from labeling XB and YA. Got it. So order, or rather the distinctness of the labels, counts. Precisely. And the source mentions this isn't a totally new idea. It had older codes, M283 and M1128. Right, from Sloan's older handbooks, I imagine. Good historical context. Okay, let's look at the sequence numbers. Important detail first, the offset. The source says 2, 2. Meaning the list starts with n2. Yes, you need at least two nodes to label two of them, makes sense. Okay, so for n2 nodes, the sequence value is 1. Correct. Only one way to have a tree with two nodes and only one way to label both. Then for n3, it jumps to 3. n4 gives us 9. Let's read a few more from the source list. For n5, it's 26. n6 is 75. n7, 214. n8, 612. n9, 1747. n10 is 495. Then 14294 for n11. 40967 for n12. 117560 for n14. n972027 for n15. Wow, okay, it grows fast. The source lists them up to n26 and mentions a link for more. Yeah, the usual OEIS links are there, list, graph, refs. The graph link would definitely show that steep climb visually. So where does this sequence fit in the bigger mathematical picture? The source has index entries. Right, it connects A000243 to rooted trees and just trees in general. Which seems obvious, but it's key, isn't it? Understanding those basic structures. Absolutely. Whether a tree has a designated root or not changes how you count things. This sequence is about unrooted trees, but the connections often involve rooted ones. And then there are the adjacent sequences and sequence in context lists. Those show its neighbors in the OEIS, right? Exactly. It lists things like A171277, A000242, A000244. You don't need to know what they are right now. But their presence tells us A000243 isn't alone. Precisely. It's a part of a whole network. These sequences are related maybe computationally, maybe structurally. It's like seeing the roads connecting nearby towns on a map. Hmm, I like that analogy. And there's a specific connection under Crossrefs. Yes, this one's more direct. It says A000243 is column K2 of A034799. You mean A034799 is like a table or an array of numbers? Probably. A sequence of sequences maybe? Parametrized by K and R sequence. A000243 is what you get when you look specifically at the K2 case. So counting trees with two labeled nodes is just one slice of a more general problem defined by A034799. It hints at a deeper structure, definitely. Okay, but how do we actually calculate these numbers? Besides just looking them up, the source gives formulas. Yes, and often there are multiple ways to describe the same sequence mathematically. Different formulas can give different insights. The first one listed is from Christian G. Bauer, A-N, A-000107. A-00007, N. Okay, so it connects our sequence to two other sequences in the OEIS. We saw A-000081 mentioned with generating functions. That's rooted trees, right? The source links it to rooted trees, yes. A-000107. Well, the source doesn't define it right here, but the formula itself is intriguing. A subtraction. How does subtracting counts of one type of tree from another give you trees with two labeled nodes? That's the combinatorial puzzle, isn't it? The formula suggests there's some relationship, maybe an inclusion-exclusion thing or a way to map the problem onto these other counts. The why often requires digging into the references or further analysis. But it shows a connection. Then there's a generating function. From Vladeta Jovovich. A-X. B-X-2. 1-B-X. Where A-X is the generating function for our sequence, A-000243. And B-X is the generating function for rooted trees, A-000081. Okay, generating functions are powerful. They sort of package the whole sequence into one function. Exactly. And the form here is suggestive. B-X squared. Maybe related to having two special points. And dividing by 1-B-X often relates to sequences or structures built iteratively. It gives an algebraic recipe using the known recipe for rooted trees. A very different way to think about it than the subtraction formula. And there's another one. Brendan McKay found A-N, A-00006N, plus A-304068. So we can also get A-000243 by adding two other sequences. Apparently so. Again, different sequences this time. It just highlights that you can often decompose a combinatorial count in multiple ways. Each formula might correspond to a different way of thinking about building or classifying these trees with two labeled nodes. Fascinating. One subtracts, one adds, one uses this algebraic generating function approach. And importantly, the source also provides code snippets. Maple from L.P. Heinz, Mathematica from Jean-Francois Alcover. So people can actually compute the terms easily. Right. These aren't just theoretical ideas. They're computationally accessible. Shifting gears a bit, what about the history and the people involved? Well, the author listed is N.J.A. Sloan himself. The founder of the OEIS. Makes sense this would be in his collection. Absolutely fundamental. And the references cited are significant. Like Riordan's 1958 book, An Introduction to Combinatorial Analysis. A classic. Plus Sloan's 1973 handbook and the Sloan-Plouffe Encyclopedia from 1995. So this sequence has been documented in major combinatorial works for a long time. It's not some obscure recent entry. No, it's well established. It's part of the core literature. Now, the links section. Sometimes you find surprises there. You definitely can. There's a link to T.D. Knows' table with terms up to N200, which is useful for researchers. Practical stuff. But then there's this other link. Ah, yes. R.J. Mathers' Arts of Paper from 2016. The title is Topologically Distinct Sets of Non-Intersecting Circles in the Plane. Circles in a plane? How does that relate to trees with labeled nodes? That seems completely different. And yet, the source explicitly says A0243 appears in Table 5 of that paper. Wow. Okay, that is unexpected. This is the magic of the OEIS, right? You follow the trail for one kind of object, these trees, and suddenly the exact same numbers pop up when counting something else entirely, like arrangements of circles. So there must be some deeper connection, a hidden isomorphism or something? There has to be. Some underlying combinatorial principle or structure that manifests as both counts. Finding that connection, figuring out why these counts match, that's where really interesting mathematics happens. It really makes you think about what these numbers truly represent, beyond just their initial definition. It forces you to look for unifying structures. Okay, nearly done. The source lists keywords, non-easy-nice. Non is straightforward, non-negative integers, which makes sense for counts. Easy and nice. Those are more subjective, aren't they? They are, but they reflect the OEIS editor's assessment. Easy might mean the definition is simple to state, or maybe the first few terms are easy to compute by hand relative to some other monstrous sequences in the database. And nice. Nice usually implies it has elegant properties, interesting formulas, maybe surprising connections, like the one we just saw. It's considered a well-behaved or fundamentally important sequence. And finally, extensions and status. The note about Christian Bauer adding terms in 1999 shows the entries are living documents. And an approved status just means it's been checked and accepted as a valid core part of the OEIS. Okay, so let's recap. We looked at A000243, the number of trees with n nodes where two were labeled. We saw the numbers themselves, how they grow, and how the sequence fits in with others, like rooted trees and this larger array, A034799. We discussed the different formulas, subtraction, addition, generating functions, hinting at various combinatorial views. We noted its history in key texts and the contributions of people like Sloan, Bauer, and McKay. And the big surprise, that unexpected connection to counting non-intersecting circles in a plane. It really underscores that A000243 isn't just a sequence. It's a node in a vast web of mathematical ideas. Which leads to a final thought for your listeners. That circle connection is fascinating. Why? Why would counting ways to label two points on a branching tree structure give the same numbers as counting arrangements of non-intersecting circles? What common ground could those two
