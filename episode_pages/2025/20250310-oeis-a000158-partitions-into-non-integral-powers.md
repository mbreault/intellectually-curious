## Transcript

Welcome back to another deep dive into the OEIS. Yeah. The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. For those of you who are new to the OEIS, it's a vast collection of integer sequences, and it's like a treasure trove for mathematicians. Especially those of us interested in number theory. Today we're going to be looking at a particularly interesting sequence. OEIS sequence A000158. Right, and this one is particularly interesting because it has some unexpected connections to statistical mechanics. Oh, very cool. So maybe to start off, can you give us like a brief overview of what this sequence A000158 is all about? Sure. So A000158 deals with something called partitions into non-integral powers. Now that might sound a little bit intimidating at first, but let's break it down. Okay. So first let's remind ourselves what a partition is in the context of number theory. Yeah, so a partition of a positive integer, it's just a way of writing that integer as a sum of smaller positive integers. Exactly. So for example, the number four has five partitions. You can write it as 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 or 1 plus 1 plus 2 or 1 plus 3 or 2 plus 2 or just four itself. Right, right. So essentially we're just breaking down a number into its additive components. Exactly. Okay. Now the non-integral powers part, that's where things get a little bit more unusual. Yeah. What exactly do we mean by non-integral powers? So non-integral powers refer to exponents that are fractions. Okay. Like 2 thirds or 1 half. So instead of dealing with whole number exponents, we're now working with exponents that are rational numbers. Okay. So it's like taking the concept of partitions and then adding this extra layer of complexity by introducing these fractional exponents. Precisely. And to make this a little bit more concrete, the OEIS entry for A000158 actually gives us a helpful inequality. It says that the nth term in the sequence A of n corresponds to the number of solutions to this inequality. X1 to the 2 thirds plus X2 to the 2 thirds plus X3 to the 2 thirds is less than or equal to n, where X1, X2, and X3 are integers. All right. So let's break down this inequality. Sure. It seems to provide a more concrete way of understanding what this sequence is counting. Exactly. So what this inequality is saying is we're looking for sets of three integers, each raised to the power of 2 thirds, and their sum has to be less than or equal to n. Okay. And the sequence counts how many of these sets exist for each value of n. So for example, if n is 5, the sequence would tell us how many different combinations of three integers raised to the 2 thirds power would add up to something less than or equal to 5. That's right. Okay. And now I know you mentioned earlier that this sequence has some connection to statistical mechanics. Yeah. And that's the part that I'm particularly curious about because, as I recall, statistical mechanics deals with the behavior of systems with many particles, like, you know, gases or liquids. Right. How does that connect to this sequence of numbers? Well, that's where the beauty of mathematics often lies in these unexpected connections between seemingly disparate fields. And there's a paper from 1951 by Agarwala and Alok titled Statistical Mechanics and Partitions into Non-Integral Powers of Integers that explores this very connection. So they found a way to relate this very abstract number theory problem to a physical system. Yes, exactly. That's fascinating. Their paper uses the principles of statistical mechanics to analyze this particular partition problem. Okay. And they do this by establishing a correspondence between the terms in a partition and the energy levels of particles in a system. Oh, okay. Can you elaborate a bit on that correspondence? Yeah, sure. So imagine you have a system of particles. Okay. And each particle can occupy certain discrete energy levels. Right. Now think of each term in a partition, like x1 to the 2 thirds, as representing one of those energy levels. Okay, so instead of thinking about just abstract numbers being added together, we're now picturing these particles occupying specific energy levels within a physical system. Exactly. Got it. And by applying the tools of statistical mechanics, which deal with the distribution of particles among different energy levels, they could then analyze how these partitions behave. So it's like they're translating a number theory problem into the language of physics. Exactly. That's really cool. Now looking at the first few terms of the sequence, we have 1, 2, 8, 19, 41. Right. What can we glean from these numbers? So these numbers represent the number of partitions for the first few values of n. As you can see, the sequence grows rather quickly. And understanding this growth pattern and deriving formulas to describe it is a key challenge in number theory. So it's not just about listing the partitions, but about understanding the structure of how this sequence evolves. Exactly. And to do this, mathematicians use various tools and techniques like generating functions, asymptotic formulas, and they even connected to other areas of mathematics like combinatorics. Sounds like a lot more to this sequence than meets the eye. Absolutely. A seemingly simple concept like partitioning numbers into non-integral powers can lead us down a very interesting rabbit hole of mathematical connections and challenges. And the work of Agarwala and Alok really shows how even seemingly unrelated fields like statistical mechanics can provide powerful insights into number theory problems. Yeah, this is why I love exploring the OEIS. You never know what you're going to find. Right. And what kind of unexpected connections you might discover. Now I'm curious to dig a little deeper into Agarwala and Alok's approach. What specific techniques did they use to bridge the gap between partitions and statistical mechanics? One of the key tools they used was something called q-series. Q-series? Yeah, which are a special type of generating function. And generating functions are a very powerful way to encode a sequence of numbers into a single function, which allows us to analyze the sequence much more effectively. So they essentially took A000158 and compressed all its information into a single function using these q-series. And then by manipulating these q-series, they were able to derive asymptotic formulas that describe the behavior of the sequence as n gets very large. That's right. So they could kind of predict how the number of partitions grows as we consider larger and larger values of n. Precisely. And their work really paved the way for a lot of further research into these connections between partitions and statistical mechanics, leading to new discoveries and a deeper understanding of both fields. Very cool. Yeah. All right, so now I'm kind of curious about these visualizations that they used to represent these partitions. I noticed that their paper included some tables and graphs. Can you tell us a little bit more about what kind of information they presented through these visuals? Yeah, sure. So the tables provided a very systematic way to showcase the number of partitions for different combinations of n, the number being partitioned, and the exponent. So you could see at a glance, for example, how many partitions were possible for n equals 5 or n equals 10 and so are with the exponent fixed at 2 thirds. So they basically created a lookup table where you could easily find the number of partitions for a specific set of parameters. Exactly. Okay, but what about the graphs? What insights did those offer? So the graphs took it a step further by depicting the distribution of these partitions visually. So if you imagine fixing the exponent at 2 thirds and then varying n side, the graph would then illustrate how the number of partitions are spread across different configurations as n increases. So instead of just seeing the total number of partitions, we get a sense of how these partitions are arranged. Exactly. Okay. And what's interesting is that for certain exponents, like the 2 thirds we've been focusing on, the graph starts to resemble a bell curve. Oh, wow. Similar to a normal distribution. That's a curious observation. It almost suggests that there might be some underlying statistical principles at play governing how these partitions are distributed. Makes you wonder if there's like a connection to the central limit theorem or something. Yeah, it's an intriguing thought. And while their paper didn't dive deep into that particular connection, it definitely opens up avenues for further exploration. It highlights how even a simple concept like partitioning numbers can touch upon some very profound mathematical ideas. Absolutely. All right, well, let's revisit this connection to statistical mechanics one more time. You mentioned earlier that they drew an analogy between the terms in a partition and the energy levels of particles. Can you elaborate on how that analogy actually helped them to apply statistical mechanics to this problem? Sure. So imagine a system of particles, each of which can exist at specific discrete energy levels. Right. Now picture each term in a partition, like x1 to the 2 thirds, as representing one of those energy levels that a particle can occupy. So instead of just dealing with these abstract numbers, we're now visualizing this physical system. Exactly. With particles distributed among different energy levels. And by applying the principles of statistical mechanics, which govern how particles are distributed among energy levels, they could then analyze the behavior of these partitions much like they would study the properties of a physical system. It's remarkable how they kind of transformed this number theory problem into something that can be analyzed using the tools of physics. Right. And what's even more interesting is that they didn't just use one type of statistical mechanics. They explored both Bose-Einstein statistics and Fermi-Dirac statistics, which have different rules for how particles can occupy energy levels. Oh yeah, I remember those from my physics courses. Can you remind us about the key distinction between these two types of statistics? Yeah, so in Bose
