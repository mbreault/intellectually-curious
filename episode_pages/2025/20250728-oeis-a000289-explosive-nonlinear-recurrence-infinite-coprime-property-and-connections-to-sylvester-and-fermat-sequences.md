## Description

Welcome, curious minds. In this episode we dive into A000289, the nonlinear recurrence that rockets from simple beginnings to monstrous numbers, while keeping every pair of terms coprime. We unpack the defining rule a(n) = a(n-1)^2 - 3·a(n-1) + 3 (and the related alternate forms), trace its tame early terms—1, 4, 7, 31—and explore its astonishing growth and the “infinite coprime” property. We’ll place it in the broader family of mutual‑k residues with k = 3, linking it to famous sequences like Sylvester’s and a Fermat‑related cousin. Along the way we’ll peek at different representations—doubly exponential ceiling forms and a product-based recurrence a(n) = 3 + ∏_{i< n} a(i)—showing how the same object can be viewed through multiple mathematical lenses. Join us as we uncover the hidden structure, surprising connections, and the beauty of simple rules leading to deep number-theoretic order.

## Transcript

Welcome, curious minds. Ever stumble upon a math rule that seems simple, but then generates numbers that just explode? Today we're doing a deep dive into one just like that. It's A000289 from the, you know, the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, that amazing resource, our plan. Unpack its definition, look at some really cool properties, and maybe uncover some surprising links in number theory. And if you look at the sequence itself, I mean, the first few terms are pretty tame. One, then four, seven, thirty-one, okay? But then, get this, by only the seventh term, it's already over 571 billion. That's just, well, it's mind-blowing growth. It really is, and the engine behind it is this definition, what we call a nonlinear recurrence relation. So each new term, what's called A_n, comes from the one before it, A_n-1. You take A_n-1, square it, then subtract three times A_n-1, and finally add three back. So the formula is A_n-1, 2, 3, A_n plus 3. It's pretty compact, isn't it? For something that generates such astronomical numbers. Right, and you highlighted that square term, A_n-1, 2, that's the nonlinear bit. How exactly does that make its growth so different from, say, a simple linear sequence? Exactly, that's the heart of it. In a linear sequence, maybe you just add five each time or double it. The growth is predictable, steady. But when you square the previous term, the step size itself grows. So the growth rate accelerates, it feeds on itself, leading to that, well, explosive behavior you mentioned. It's a totally different beast. And there's another really remarkable thing about this sequence. Michael Somos pointed this out. It's what's known as an infinite co-prime sequence. Infinite co-prime. So, wait, does that mean no two different terms in the entire sequence, no matter how huge they get, ever share a common factor besides one? That's precisely it. Any pair you pick, A_m and A_n, where m isn't equal to n, their greatest common divisor is just one. That seems counterintuitive for numbers growing so fast and defined recursively. How do they stay so mathematically separate? It is quite surprising, isn't it? For a sequence built upon its own previous terms to maintain this perfect relative primality, well, it's mathematically quite elegant. It suggests a deep underlying structure, despite the apparent chaos of the rapid growth. Each term is, in a prime factorization sense, fundamentally new. Okay, so it's got this explosive growth and this unique co-prime property. Does A000289 just sit off on its own, or is it related to other things we might know in mathematics? Oh, it definitely doesn't stand alone. Great question. Sepulchre Stonen actually showed it's part of a bigger picture, a larger family. Think of it as a specific instance where a parameter, let's call it k, is set to the three. This family involves sequences defined by what are called mutual k residues. K residues? What does that mean practically for this sequence? It essentially means that if you take any term a and divide it by any earlier term ai, you always get the same remainder. And for a000289, that special remainder, that k, is three. Ah, I see. And you mentioned a family, so there are other sequences like this with different k values. Exactly, and some of them are quite famous. For example, if k1, you get Sylvester's sequence, a000058. If k2, you get a sequence related to the Fermat numbers, a000215. Wow, so a000289 is actually in pretty esteemed company. It's part of this significant lineage. Precisely. And there's more. The sequence can actually be described using other quite different looking formulas. Each gives a different angle on it. For instance, there's one involving the ceiling function. It looks like ceiling c2n plus 1. Ceiling c2 to the power of 2n plus 1. That 2n in the exponent looks familiar. Yes, that structure, as Aho and Sloan discuss in their work, hints at what's called doubly exponential growth. It means it grows even faster than a standard exponential function. The exponent itself is growing exponentially. So it's not just fast, it's like accelerating acceleration. You can think of it that way, yes. And then quite surprisingly, there's another formula for n0. It's an 3 plus product a n-1 ai. Hold on, the next term is 3 plus the product of all the previous terms. That's right, for n greater than 0. It shows this incredible multiplicative relationship hiding within the sequence, all linked back to the number 3. That's amazing. The same sequence generated by squaring and subtracting, or by this doubly exponential form, or by multiplying all prior terms and adding 3. It's like looking at the same object through completely different lenses. Each formula tells a different story about its structure. So let's recap. We've journeyed through a000289. It starts with a simple nonlinear rule, a n1, 2, 3 a n plus 3. It absolutely explodes in value. It has this really elegant infinite co-prime property. And it's not isolated. It connects deeply to other major sequences through this idea of k residues, with k3 in this case. And seeing those different formulas, the recursive one, the doubly exponential one, the product one, it really makes you think, doesn't it? How can such seemingly basic starting points, these simple recurrence relations, lead to structures that are so complex, yet also expressible in such varied and frankly beautiful ways? It truly showcases the intricate beauty and maybe the surprising interconnectedness hidden within number theory. Something simple generating immense complexity and hidden order. It leaves you wondering what other patterns are out there. We really encourage you, the listener, to dive into the OEIS yourselves. Explore a little. You never know what fascinating numerical worlds you might discover.
