## Transcript

All right, welcome back to the deep dive. For all you number theory folks out there who are sticking with us on this journey, you know we're all about those gems tucked away in the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. It's not just some database, you know, it's like a whole chronicle of mathematical patterns. And today we're diving headfirst into a really cool corner of it. We're talking about OEIS sequence A173, the unitary sociable numbers. Yeah, exactly. The deeper we get into number theory, you'll see just how often the OEIS pops up as this amazing springboard for getting a handle on some pretty complex relationships. Today's exploration of these unitary sociable numbers, it really builds beautifully upon all those foundational ideas you've already encountered. Now, unitary, I think that's a term some folks might still be, you know, getting comfy with. So let's break it down. What makes a divisor unitary at its core? Okay, so think of a divisor D of a number N. It's unitary if it doesn't share any of those prime factors with its partner in crime, its cofactor 10. Picture the prime factorization N in your head. If N is like a product of primes, we'll call them pi, each raised to a power ai, then a unitary divisor D is formed by grabbing each pi and raising it to either the power 0 or to that full power ai. It's an all or nothing deal from each prime power, which makes it pretty different from those ordinary divisors, because those guys can have, you know, those in-between powers. For example, if N equals 12, that's 2 raised to the power 8 times 3 raised, the unitary divisors are 1, which is 2 raised to 3 raised, and we got 3 that's 2 raised to 3 raised, then 4 coming from 2 raised to 3 raised, and finally 12 itself, which is 2 raised to 3 raised. You see how each prime factor is either completely in the divisor or totally left out. Yeah, that all or nothing thing really brings it into focus. So we're also dealing with sociable numbers here. We get perfect numbers and amicable numbers. Those are special relationships based on their divisors. But how do these sociable numbers, how do they kind of generalize these ideas? Perfect numbers, right, where the sum of those proper divisors equals the number itself. And amicable pairs, where the sum of proper divisors of each number equals the other. They both represent these closed loops if you're looking at the sum of divisors. Sociable numbers, they just stretch that idea out to cycles of any length. So instead of bouncing right back to the starting number that's perfect, or going back and forth between two numbers, which is amicable, you get a sequence that finally circles back to the beginning after several steps. And these, you know, these fascinating cycles, a mathematician by the name of Paul Poulet, he really got the ball rolling with their formal study and named them back in the early 1900s. So today, we're not just looking at these cyclical relationships in general. We're specifically interested in when we build these cycles using the sum of these unitary proper divisors. What does that shift in focus, what does that really tell us? You hit the nail on the head. What we're after are those unitary sociable numbers, where the sequence comes from repeatedly taking a number and figuring out the sum of its unitary proper divisors. So that means all the unitary divisors except for the number itself. If this whole process eventually leads you back to your starting number, well, then you've got yourself a unitary sociable number. To really wrap our heads around this, let's take a step back and think about those more familiar ordinary aliquot sequences. Let's say we pick a number. How do we get the next term in that sequence? Okay, an ordinary aliquot sequence, it all starts with a number. Each term after that, you get it by adding up all the proper divisors. So that's all the positive divisors of that number, but you leave out the number itself. And it's right there in these ordinary aliquot sequences where we stumble upon those sociable numbers as cycles, right? Exactly. A sociable number, we call it of order n, is a number that's part of a cycle of length n in its aliquot sequence. So a perfect number, that's a sociable number of order one. And your amicable pairs, those form sociable numbers of order two. You know, the Wikipedia article about these sociable numbers, it points out something pretty wild. Even with all the searching we've done, no sociable numbers of order three have been found. That's a pretty big gap in our understanding, don't you think? It really is. It's a fascinating open question in number theory. The searches, they've gone up to some really big numbers, and we still haven't found any order three sociable numbers. It's like there's something going on behind the scenes preventing them from existing. Maybe it has to do with how the divisors are spread out or how those sums behave. It really highlights how even in these seemingly simple parts of number theory, some deep mysteries are still out there. So now that we have a picture of those ordinary sociable numbers, how do things change when we throw in this unitary condition? Could we imagine a similar type of sequence, but using those unitary divisors instead? You got it. We can define a unitary aliquot sequence the same way we do a regular one. You begin with a number and get the next term. You just add up all its proper unitary divisors, and then you just keep repeating that process. So a unitary sociable number would be part of a cycle that pops up in these unitary aliquot sequences, right? That's exactly it. A unitary sociable number, it belongs to a set of numbers where if you keep calculating the sum of the proper unitary divisors over and over, you'll eventually land back at the number you started with, creating a closed loop. To make this really clear, could we maybe look at a couple of examples of those ordinary sociable numbers, just to see how these cycles work in action? Absolutely. One famous example is this five cycle that Poulain discovered. 12496, 14288, 15472, 14536, and 14264. If you add up the proper divisors of 12496, you'll get 14288, and then the sum of the proper divisors of 14288, well, that's 15472, and so on. You keep going until you add up the proper divisors of 14264, and bam, you're back to 12496. Another well-known one is a 28 cycle. It kicks off with 14316. The whole sequence of numbers in this cycle, it's actually in the OEIS. It's listed as A072890. You can really see how those sums come together to form a closed chain. Wow, a 28 cycle, that's a pretty long and tangled relationship. So when we switch over to unitary divisors, do we see similar kinds of structures? Like, are there unitary amicable pairs out there? Yes, absolutely. We have those unitary versions for both perfect and amicable numbers. So the unitary amicable pair is made up of two different numbers where the sum of the proper unitary divisors of each number equals the other number. One example that's well-known is the pair 114 and 126. The proper unitary divisors of 114, they're 1, 2, 3, 19, 38, and 57. And if you add those up, you get 120. Oh, hold on a sec. I think I might have misspoken there. Let me double-check my notes. Ah, right. The proper unitary divisors of 114, which is 2 times 3 times 19, are 1, 2, 3, 19, 6, 38, and 57. And they add up to 126. And if we take a 126, which is 2 times 3 squared times 7, its proper unitary divisors are 1, 2, 7, 9, 14, 18, and 63. Those add up to 114. So yeah, we can confirm that 114 and 126, they make up a unitary amicable pair. So just like we have perfect numbers in the usual sense, we also have numbers that are, what, unitary perfect? Precisely. A unitary perfect number, it's a number that's equal to the sum of its own proper unitary divisors. And what's interesting is that we've only discovered a handful of unitary perfect numbers so far. So this brings us back to the star of the show, our sequence in the OEIS, 000173. It's got the title, Unitary Sociable Numbers, Smallest Member of Each Cycle. So essentially, this sequence is like a directory of the starting points for all these unitary cycles. Exactly. That's a great way to put it. Entry A000173 in the OEIS, it lists the smallest number that's found in each of those known cycles of unitary sociable numbers. And this is really handy because a cycle, it might have a bunch of numbers in it, but the OEIS, it likes to give us a representative, and it often picks the smallest one. If you look at the first few terms of A000173, you'll see numbers like 30, 1482, 2418, 124180, and so on. And the fact that it specifies smallest member, that tells us that these unitary sociable numbers, they can form cycles that are
