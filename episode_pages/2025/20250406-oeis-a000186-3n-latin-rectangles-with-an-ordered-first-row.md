## Description

A deep dive into A000186, the count of 3Ã—N Latin rectangles with the first row fixed in increasing order. We unpack what a Latin rectangle is, explain what 'ordered first row' means (reduced rectangles), and trace the history from McMahonâ€™s framework to Riordanâ€™s rigorous 3-row proof. We then explore Erdos and Kaplanskyâ€™s sieve-based asymptotics for growing numbers of rows, the refinements for the 3Ã—N case (including numerical evidence by Karawala), and the major extension by Godsil and McKay that widens the range of valid k. Along the way we connect the asymptotic formula roughly f(n,k) ~ (n!)^k exp(-k(kâˆ’1)/2) to the specific 3Ã—N case, highlighting how these ideas fit into broader combinatorics and the OEIS landscape.

## Transcript

Welcome back everyone for another deep dive. Today we are diving into the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. It's a huge resource, a huge catalog of these mathematical sequences. Anyone listening, especially anyone studying number theory, this is an indispensable resource, right? It really is. So we're going to dive into one specific entry and it's a doozy. It's A000186. And the sequence concerns these things called 3xN Latin rectangles with an ordered first row. And that might sound like a mouthful. So let's unpack that a little bit. Yeah, let's take it one step at a time. So what is a Latin rectangle? So you think of a grid or an array and it has a certain number of rows and columns. So it's N by K, so N rows and K columns. And you fill in the grid with the integers from 1 to N. The crucial rule is that you cannot have the same number appearing twice in any one row or column. So each number from 1 to N appears at most once in each row and each column. Okay, so it's kind of like a Sudoku puzzle. Yeah, it's a bit like a Sudoku. But not necessarily square without the block constraints. That's right, you just have the row and column uniqueness. Okay, alright, so A000186 deals with 3xN Latin rectangles. What's the 3x? Yeah, so the 3x part tells you that there are 3 rows in your Latin rectangle. And the N represents the number of columns. And as this number of columns changes, you get different terms in the sequence A000186. So we're looking at these rectangles with 3 rows and a varying number of columns, N. Filled with numbers from 1 to N, such that this Latin property, no repetitions in rows or columns. Right, 3 rows and columns. Numbers 1 to N, no repeats. And then you said ordered first row. What's that about? So that means that in the very first row of our 3xN Latin rectangle, it's not just any random arrangement of the numbers from 1 to N. It's specifically the sequence 1, 2, 3, and so on, up to N, in increasing order. So that's a restriction that we impose, and that gives us what's often referred to as a reduced Latin rectangle. So we're essentially starting with row 1 fixed, and then we're seeing how many ways can we complete the other 2 rows. And this sort of feels like it fits into a bigger area of math, you know, combinatorics. Yeah, absolutely. What is combinatorics? Combinatorics is the study of counting and arranging discrete objects. So, enumerating these specific 3xn Latin rectangles with ordered first row is a particular problem within that broader study of counting combinatorial structures. Yeah, we're trying to find a way to determine exactly or approximately how many such arrangements are possible for a given value of N. So, for this deep dive, our goal is to understand what mathematical research has revealed about the number of these very specific Latin rectangles. And I guess they use R3 of N sometimes? So, R3 of N is often used when the first row is ordered. L3 of N is when it's not ordered. Oh, okay. So, what has the mathematical community discovered about counting these things? Yeah, so the general problem of counting n by k Latin rectangles has a long history. And early on, McMahon was a mathematician who developed these powerful operational methods that could, in principle, solve this for any n and k. However, for our particular case, k equals 3, people have sought more explicit and more usable solutions. And figures like Erdos and Kaplansky, among others, directly addressed this scenario. So, McMahon gave us a theoretical framework, but getting to the actual numbers when there's 3 rows was quite difficult. What were some of the initial challenges that researchers faced? Yeah, so exact enumeration proved to be quite a hurdle early on. However, a very insightful conjecture arose proposing that the total number of n by k Latin rectangles behaves like n factorial to the power of k multiplied by a factor of the exponential of minus k times k minus 1 over 2. So, this gives us a sense of the sheer scale and the rapid growth in the number of these rectangles as n and k increase. It's like trying to count the possible shuffles of multiple decks of cards. The numbers get astronomical very quickly. So, isomorphic, this formula gives us an approximation for huge values of n. Yeah, it describes the trend as n becomes very large. Now, there were some early missteps in trying to confirm this conjecture for k equals 3. A mathematician named Jacob made an error that initially led him to doubt the conjecture in this specific case. Fortunately, another mathematician, Carol Waller, corrected this error and through extensive calculations provided very strong numerical evidence supporting the conjecture for 3-row Latin rectangles. Now, interestingly, it appears that Riordan was the first to give a rigorous mathematical proof specifically for the k equals 3 case. So, the early picture involves a guess about the growth rate, some hiccups and corrections, and then a formal proof for the 3-row case. Where do Erdos and Kaplansky come in? Yeah, so Erdos and Kaplansky's work was a significant step forward. They aimed to prove this asymptotic conjecture, not just for a fixed number of rows k as n grows infinitely large, but also for a range of k that could itself grow within n. Okay. Specifically up to roughly log n to the power of 3 over 2 minus epsilon, where epsilon is a small positive number. They also pointed out that for a fixed k, like our k equals 3, a shorter proof was indeed possible. So, they were trying to make it so that the rows could grow as n grows. That's right. So, not just fix k, but k growing with n. Okay. Yeah. Interesting. How did they tackle this? Yeah, so their primary tool was something called the sieve method, which is also known as the principle of inclusion-exclusion. So, imagine you want to count the elements in the union of several sets. You could first add up the sizes of all the sets, but then you've overcounted the elements that are in the intersection of two sets. So, you have to subtract those. But then you've undercounted the elements that are in the intersection of three sets. Right. So, you add those back in and so on. Okay. Erdos and Kaplansky used this idea to estimate the number of ways to add a k plus 1 row to an existing k by n Latin rectangle without violating the Latin property. So, they're systematically getting rid of the bad ones. Exactly. Okay. They started with n factorial, the total number of permutations for the new row, and then they subtracted the permutations that would create a conflict, a repeated number in a column with the existing k rows in at least one column. Then they adjusted for the over-subtraction of cases with conflicts in two or more columns and so on. And this led them to a formula, which I won't write down explicitly, but it involves this quantic a sub r, which represents the number of ways to choose r distinct integers in the existing k by n Latin rectangle, such that no two are in the same column. So, that was their key idea. So, what were the key results they got? So, for the general case, where k is less than approximately log n to the power of 3 over 2 minus epsilon, they rigorously established the asymptotic formula for f of n k, the number of n by k Latin rectangles as both n factorial to the power of k times the exponential of minus k times k minus 1 over 2. So, this confirmed that earlier conjecture over a much wider range of k than was previously known. And what about for 3 by? Yeah, so for the case f of n 3, they derived an asymptotic series, which is a little bit complicated, but it's basically 1 minus 1 over n minus 1 over 2 and square plus and so on. They even included a table in their paper comparing this asymptotic approximation with the exact values calculated by Karawala. And the agreement was quite good, especially for larger values of n. This kind of validation is crucial in asymptotic analysis. Yeah, and did they have a sense? Yeah, so they observed... What are the limits of their method? Yeah, they observed that the form of their asymptotic series seemed to suggest that their expression might become inaccurate, perhaps even invalid, around k equals n to the power of 13, although they acknowledged they couldn't prove this rigorously. So, they pushed the boundaries of our understanding, but they also knew where the limits might be. Okay, what came after their work? Right, so a significant leap forward was made by Godsel and McKay, who were able to improve the range of k for which we have accurate asymptotic enumerations of Latin rectangles. Okay, what was their main result? Yeah, so they proved that for n approaching infinity and k equals little o of n to the power of 6 over 7, meaning k grows slower than n to the 6 over 7, the number of k by n Latin rectangles, denoted by L of k, n to n, is asymptotically equal to this falling factorial to the power of k times the exponential of minus k choose 2. Okay. So, it's worth noting that this was actually a consequence of a much more general theorem that they proved. Okay. But nevertheless, this gives a much larger range for k. Right, it's huge. Yeah, compared to Erdos and Kaplansky
