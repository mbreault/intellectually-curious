## Description

We explore A000091, a multiplicative OEIS sequence defined by prime-factor rules: powers of 2 map to 2; the prime 3 maps to 2 but higher powers map to 0; and primes p > 3 map to 2 or 0 according to p mod 3, with a universal override: any number divisible by 9 yields 0. We discuss how these rules can be implemented procedurally in Maple and Mathematica, using Legendre and Jacobi symbols to shortcut remainder tests, enabling fast evaluation for large n. Finally we pull back to the bigger picture: links to number theory, cryptography, and even signal processing, illustrating how a tiny rule set can illuminate connections across math.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone, to our ongoing deep dive into the world of the OEIS. The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Or OEIS for short. As always for those just joining us. The OEIS is this incredible... It's an incredible resource. Online database. Yeah. With literally hundreds of thousands of integer sequences. That's really remarkable. And it's like this digital library where each sequence is kind of its own unique story just waiting to be told. It's true. And what's really interesting is how these sequences connect. Right. Seemingly totally unrelated areas of math. Absolutely. And exploring these connections can really lead to some surprising discoveries. Yeah, it's like this giant web of interconnected ideas. It is. And it's just fascinating to kind of pull on one thread and see where it leads you. Absolutely. And today we're going to be pulling on a particularly interesting thread. Okay. We're looking at sequence A00001. Now this sequence starts like this. One, two, two, zero, four, two, two, zero, zero, zero, four. That's a mouthful. It is a mouthful. And at first glance it looks kind of random. It does. Can you tell us what makes this sequence special? Well, this sequence is what we call a multiplicative sequence. And what that means is that to figure out any number in the sequence, we need to look at its prime factorization. Okay, so prime factorization. Let's just break that down quickly for our listeners. Sure. Prime factorization basically means you're taking a number and breaking it down into its fundamental building blocks. Right. Which are the prime numbers. Exactly. So for example, the prime factorization of 12 would be 2 times 2 times 3. Precisely. Okay. So in the case of A00001, the prime factors of a number determine its corresponding value in the sequence. Okay, so how do we go from those prime factors to the actual sequence value? So there are a few rules that kind of govern the sequence. Let's start with the simplest one. Any power of 2, like 2, 4, 8, 16, will always result in a 2 in the sequence. Okay. So that explains a lot of the 2s that we see early on. Right, straightforward enough. Yeah. What about other numbers though? So the number 3 is a bit unique. By itself, it maps to a 2 in the sequence. But any higher power of 3, like 9, 27, 81, those all result in a 0. Interesting. Yeah, so the prime number 3 gets a little bit of special treatment. It does. Now for prime numbers bigger than 3, things get a little bit more nuanced. The rule depends on the remainder you get when you divide that prime number by 3. Okay. So if the remainder is 1, the sequence value is a 2. But if the remainder is 2, the value is a 0. Okay, so to recap then, powers of 2 always give us a 2 in the sequence. Yes. The number 3 by itself gives us a 2. But any higher power of 3 results in a 0. That's right. And for other prime numbers, it depends on the remainder after dividing by 3. Precisely. Okay, I think I'm following along. Good. Now let's test our understanding a little bit here. Okay. Let's take the number 12, which we already know factors into 2 times 2 times 3. Yes. If we're following our rules. I think we might expect 2 times 2 times 2, which would give us 8. However, if we actually look at the sequence, the value for 12 is 4. Hmm, that's interesting. Why doesn't it follow the rules that we just discussed? Ah, well, there's one crucial rule that we haven't mentioned yet. If a number is divisible by 9, which is 3 times 3, the result is always a 0, regardless of any other calculations. And since 12 is divisible by 3, but not by 9, we get the value of 4. Ah, that makes sense. Yeah. So that divisible by 9 rule kind of trumps all the other rules. Exactly. It's like a hidden override in the sequence's logic. Kind of a special case. Interesting. Okay, so we've unpacked a little bit here, these seemingly simple rules that generate A000091. Yes. But I have a feeling that this is really just the tip of the iceberg here. Oh, absolutely. There's gotta be more to the story, right? There always is with the OEIS. So what else is going on with A000091? Well, what's really remarkable is that this sequence can be calculated not only through these rules, but also procedurally using code. Okay. In fact, the OEIS entry for A000091 even includes code snippets in Maple and Mathematica. Intriguing. Yeah. Sounds like we're about to dive into some computational territory. Computational territory, yeah. But before we do that, I think it's important for us to let all this sink in a little bit for our listeners. Definitely. We've covered a lot of ground already. We have. Yeah, take a moment, folks. Take a moment. I think it's worth kind of highlighting, you know why code snippets are even relevant in the context of a mathematical sequence. Yeah, I think that's a great point. You know, and some of our listeners might be wondering why we would even need code to deal with something that seems, you know, fairly straightforward on the surface. Right, exactly. It's all about scalability. Okay. So the rules we've discussed, they work well for small numbers. But imagine trying to calculate the sequence value for, say, a 10-digit number. Manually factoring that number into primes and then applying the rules would be incredibly tedious. Right, it would be a very manual and time-consuming process. Exactly. So the code is really providing us with a more efficient way to handle these calculations. Especially as the numbers get larger, where manual calculations become impractical. Okay, so let's talk about these code snippets a little bit. You mentioned Maple and Mathematica. Could you give us just a high-level overview of what these snippets are actually doing? Sure. So both of these code snippets, they utilize some advanced mathematical tools. And these are called the Legendre and Jacobi symbols. Okay, now I know those terms might sound a little intimidating to some of our listeners. Could you kind of demystify them for us a little bit? Of course. So imagine you're trying to figure out if a certain prime number, let's say 17, leaves a remainder of 1 or 2 when divided by 3. Right, and that's a crucial part of the rules for A000091. That determines whether that prime number contributes a 2 or a 0 to the sequence value. Now, the Legendre and Jacobi symbols are like mathematical shortcuts. That let us determine that remainder information very quickly and efficiently. They're tools that mathematicians use to analyze the properties of prime numbers in relation to other numbers. So instead of having to manually divide each prime factor by 3 and checking the remainder, the code can use these symbols to get that information directly. Yes, it's like having a specialized calculator that just instantly tells you the answer without you having to do the long division yourself. I like it. It's a shortcut. It's elegant. It is. And so these code snippets really kind of reveal this deeper layer of mathematical elegance and how this sequence can be calculated. Yeah, and it's a great example, I think, of how computational methods can really complement our understanding of these more theoretical concepts. Absolutely. Well, let's zoom out a little bit here. You know, we've explored the rules, we've delved into the code, we've even touched upon these interesting Legendre and Jacobi symbols. But where does A000091 actually fit into the broader kind of mathematical landscape? That's a great question, and that's where things get really exciting. Okay. Because while A000091 might seem like a very niche sequence, its properties actually hint at potential connections to some really fundamental areas of mathematics. Okay, what kinds of areas are we talking about here? So, for instance, its multiplicative nature suggests possible links to number theory. Okay, number theory. Which is a field that explores, you know, the properties of integers. So how might this sequence be relevant to something like number theory? Well, number theory deals with concepts like divisibility, prime numbers, modular arithmetic, all things that we've encountered, while exploring A000091. Right. So the sequence's behavior might shed light on things like the distribution of prime numbers, or reveal patterns in how numbers behave when divided by specific values. So studying this seemingly simple sequence could potentially offer insights into deeper number theoretical questions. Precisely. And the connections don't stop there. This sequence might also have implications for cryptography. Cryptography. Which is the science of secure communication. Okay, now that's an unexpected twist. Yeah. How could a sequence like this relate to something as complex as cryptography? Well, a lot of cryptographic algorithms rely heavily on number theory, particularly the properties of prime numbers. Right. And sequences with predictable patterns, like A000091, can sometimes be analyzed for potential vulnerabilities, or used to generate keys that are difficult to crack. So by understanding the underlying structure of this sequence, we might be able to gain insights into the security of certain encryption methods. It's definitely an area worth exploring. Interesting. And there's even a potential connection to signal processing. Signal processing. Which is a field that deals with analyzing and manipulating signals, like sound or images. Okay, now I'm really intrigued. How could a sequence of numbers relate to something like signal processing? So signal processing often involves transforming signals
