## Transcript

Welcome back to our deep dive series exploring the really fascinating corners of the OEIS. It's always a pleasure. So much hidden structure in numbers. Absolutely. Today we're zoning in on one sequence that's particularly interesting for number theory students. It's A000189. Ah, yes, a good one. And the description is number of solutions to x cubed congruent to 0 mod n. That's right. So for any whole number n you pick, we're just counting how many numbers x between 0 and n minus 1. So in that specific range. Exactly. How many of those when you cube them give you something that's divisible by n or congruent to 0 mod n. Okay, and our mission today basically is to figure out what this sequence, what counting these solutions tells us about, well, cubes modulo n. Precisely. It sounds simple maybe, but it opens up quite a bit about modular arithmetic. Right, so let's look at the first few terms. It starts 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 1, 2. Quite a mix there. It does jump around a bit, doesn't it? Then 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2. And the OEIS entry mentions the offset is 1, 4. What's the significance of that? Well, the 1 tells us the first term listed, that 1 corresponds to n1, so a1, 1. Which makes sense. x0 is the only solution for by 3 congruent to 0 mod 1. Exactly. The 4 modifying the offset sometimes points to maybe an older starting point or a version, or just highlights a particularly interesting early value. In this case, a4, 2 is maybe the first non-trivial value. Okay, and there's this comment too. Shadow transform of the cubes. A000578. Now A000578 is just the sequence of cubes, 1, 8, 27. Right, and the shadow transform, well, that's a more advanced concept, linking sequences. Too much for today. Probably. But the gist is, it suggests a structured relationship. How the perfect cubes themselves influence the count of these cube roots of 0 mod n. It's not just random. Okay, let's think of the definition then. Examples usually help. It says a4 equals 2. Why? Okay, let's check mod 4. We look at x0, 1, 2, 3. Right. So 0 cubed is 0. That's one solution. 1 cubed is 1, not 0 mod 4. 2 cubed is 8, and 8 is congruent to 0 mod 4. So x2 is another solution. Ah, there's a second one. And 3 cubed is 27, which is 3 mod 4. Not that. So just x0 and x2, that gives us 4, 2. Makes sense. What about the next interesting one? Maybe a 9. The sequence says a9. Right, mod 9. Let's see. x0 gives 0 cubed is 0. That's 1. Always counts. Huh? 1 cubed is 1. 2 cubed is 8. Neither are 0 mod 9. Okay. 3 cubed is 27. And 27 is exactly 3 times 9, so 27 is 0 mod 9. That's solution number 2 by 3. Got it. Then 4 cubed is 64. That's 1 mod 9. 5 cubed is 125, which is 8 mod 9. Still no. But 6 cubed, that's 216. Is that divisible by 9? Let's see. 2 plus 1 plus 6 is 9. Yes, it is. So 6 cubed is 0 mod 9. That's our third solution, x6. Okay, so 0, 3, and 6. And you can check 7 and 8. They won't work. 7 cubed is 1 mod 9. 8 cubed is 8 mod 9. So three solutions, a9 is 3. Great. These examples really nail down what we're counting. They do. They show the process. Now, on to the properties. The OEIS entry says the sequence is multiplicative. That sounds important. Oh, it's very important in number theory. It means if you have two numbers, say m and n, that don't share any common factors besides 1. Like 4 and 9. Exactly. They're relatively prime. Then the value of this sequence for their product, am times n, is just the product of their individual values, am times an. So a36 should be a4 times a9. Let's check. We found a4, 2, and a9 equals 3. So a4 times a9 is 2 times 3, which is 6. And is a36 equal to 6? We'd need the formula for that. We would, or we could list the solutions. But yes, multiplicativity tells us a36 should be 6. And the reason this property is so powerful is that it means we really only need to understand the sequence for prime powers. Numbers like p to the e. Ah, because any number n can be broken down into its prime factorization. Precisely. If you know a for all primes p and exponents e, you can find an for any n just by multiplying the values for its prime power factors. And conveniently, there is a formula for ap. It says ap equals p raised to the power of floor of 2e divided by 3. That's the one. p to the floor of 2e over 3. So let's use that for our examples. For a4, n is 4, which is 2 squared. So p2e2. Right, so the formula gives 2 raised to the power of floor of 2 times 2 divided by 3. That's floor of 43. Floor of 43 is just 1. So 2 to the power of 1, which is 2. And that matches what we found. a4 is 2. Perfect. And for a9, n is 3 squared. So p3e2. Same calculation structure. 3 raised to the power of floor of 2 times 2 over 3. Floor of 43 again. Still 1. So 3 to the power of 1, which is 3. And that matches a9 equals 3. Brilliant. That formula seems incredibly useful. It's the core computational tool for this sequence, really. It directly connects the number of solutions to the prime factorization of n. Okay, there's another formula mentioned too. an, a01 955n. And a01 955 is the largest cube-free divisor of n. What's the connection there? Right. Cube-free meaning it's not divisible by any perfect cube other than 1. Got it. Think about n. You can always write n as a product of its largest cube-free part. Let's call it cn. And some perfect cubes, say k cubed. So n equals 3nk3. Okay, like 24 is 3 times 8, which is 3 times 2 cubed. So c24, 3. Exactly. Or 72 is 9 times 8. Here c72 would be 9, because 9 isn't divisible by 8 or 27. And 72 equals 9, 23. Ah, wait. 72 equals 8, 9. So it's 9, 23, c72. Let me recheck. 72 equals 23, 32. The cube-free part has primes only to the power 1 or 2. So it's 32, 9. Yes, c72, 9. Right, so a01955572 equals 9. Now think about the condition x cubed congruent to 0 mod n. This means x cubed must be divisible by n. If n equals cnk3, then x cubed must be divisible by cn and by k3. For by 3 to be divisible by k3, x must be divisible by k. Makes sense. And for by 3 to be divisible by cn, well, cn only has prime factors to the first or second power. If p divides cn, then by 3 divisible of p squared means x must also be divisible by p. So basically x has to be divisible by k and also by every prime factor of cn. Correct, which means x must be divisible by the product of k and all the distinct prime factors of cn. Let's call the product of the distinct prime factors of cn as rad cn. So x must be a multiple of k rad cn. Hmm, that sounds a bit different from n cn. Is there a simpler way to see it? Let's reconsider the condition by 3 equals 0 mod p. For this to hold, x must be divisible by p raised to the power ceil e3. The ceiling function. Smallest integer greater than or equal to. Yes. So if n is the product of pi to the e, then x must be divisible by the product of pi to the ceil e i3. Let this divisor be d. The number of multiples of d up to n1 is nd. Okay, so an equals d, where d is the product of pi to the ceil e i3. How does d relate to the largest cube-free divisor a019555n? Ah, let's think about the formula ap equals p floor 2e3. We also have n product pi and an product pi floor
