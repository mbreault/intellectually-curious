## Description

In this episode we unpack A000176â€”the Generalized Tangent Numbers (DN2). We trace its Dirichlet-series definition using the Jacobi symbol and show how the even-values L_{2n} tie to D_{2n}. We then explore the surprising connection to alternating permutations and Euler zigzag numbers via AndrÃ©â€™s theorem, and discuss what, if anything, D_{2n} counts combinatorially. If you enjoy seeing how analytic number theory and combinatorics intersect, this oneâ€™s for you.

## Transcript

Welcome back to another deep dive into the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. You know, for our listeners out there who are into number theory, this is, I think, going to be a really fun one. Yeah, I'm looking forward to this one. Today we're going to be looking at A000176, which is called the Generalized Tangent Numbers, DN2. Oh yeah, this is a classic. So for our listeners, you can see this sequence right on your screen. It starts 2, 11, 46, 128, 272, and it just keeps going. And, you know, you might just look at it and think, oh, that's just a list of numbers. But the cool thing about the OEIS, the thing that makes it so powerful, is how it connects different parts of math that you wouldn't expect. I think that's a great point. What makes the OEIS so fascinating is how it reveals these unexpected connections between different mathematical concepts. Exactly. And this sequence is like the perfect example. We're going to see how it ties together some pretty deep ideas from different areas of number theory. Definitely. There's a lot to unpack here. Okay, so the OEIS entry for A000176 starts off by giving us a definition, right? And it involves something called a Dirichlet series. Yeah, it starts with this Dirichlet series, law, defined as the sum over all k from 0 to infinity of this Jacobi symbol, next 8 to k plus 1, divided by 2k plus 1, raised to the power s. Okay, hold on. The Jacobi symbol, that's like, that's pretty important for understanding this whole thing, right? Jacobi symbol? Oh, absolutely. It's a generalization of the Legendre symbol, and it plays a crucial role in defining these generalized tangent numbers. Right. The Legendre symbol, something a lot of our listeners are probably familiar with. So how about the Dirichlet series itself? What exactly is that? Well, you can think of a Dirichlet series kind of like a generating function. It's an infinite sum where each term has a specific form. In this case, we have the Jacobi symbol divided by these powers of 2k plus 1, all raised to the power s, where s is a complex number. Got it. And this Dirichlet series is how the OEIS defines these generalized tangent numbers, D-A-A-N, right? Yeah, that's right. The OEIS gives us this equation that relates the value of the Dirichlet series, Laches, evaluated at 2n to these D-A-N numbers. Specifically, for any integer of bigger than 1 and any positive integer n, we have L2n equals pi divided by 2a, raised to the power 2n, multiplied by the square root of a times D-A-N, all divided by 2n1 factorial. Wow. Okay, so that equation connects our Dirichlet series to these generalized tangent numbers. But for our specific sequence today, A000176, which is D-N2, what happens to that equation? We're basically setting it equal to 2, right? You got it. When we plug in A2, the equation simplifies to L2n equals pi 5 fourth at the power 2n times the square root of 2 times D2n, all divided by 2n1 factorial. And that's how the terms in our sequence, A000176, are directly linked to the values of this specific Dirichlet series. Okay, I think I'm following so far. But we keep talking about this Jacobi symbol. Maybe a quick refresher for our listeners. How is it defined and how does it relate to the Legendre symbol, which we mentioned earlier? Sure. So the Legendre symbol, denoted A, tells us whether an integer A is a quadratic residue modulo a prime number P. In other words, it tells us if there exists an integer X such that X squared is congruent to a modulo P. Right, and the Jacobi symbol kind of expands on that idea, doesn't it? Exactly. The Jacobi symbol, written as N, extends the concept of the Legendre symbol to the case where N is any positive odd integer, not just a prime. Okay, so if N is not prime, how do we actually calculate the Jacobi symbol? I'm guessing prime factorization plays a role here, right? It does. If we break down N into its prime factors, say P1 to the power alpha 1 times P2 to the power alpha 2 and so on, up to PK to the power alpha K, then the Jacobi symbol N is just the product of the Legendre symbols for each prime factor raised to their corresponding powers. So it becomes A1 to the power alpha 1 times A2 to the power alpha 2 all the way up to the power alpha K. Okay, so it all boils down to calculating a bunch of Legendre symbols. Got it. So we've got this definition of A000176 using Birkhoff series and the Jacobi symbol, but then digging around, we found a connection to a completely different concept, alternating permutations. This wasn't immediately obvious from the cross-references in A000176 itself, so it seems like a pretty fascinating link. It is. It's amazing how this sequence, defined through analytic number theory, finds this unexpected connection to a purely combinatorial concept. It really shows how different areas of math can intertwine. Totally. Okay, so for our listeners who might not be as familiar with them, what exactly are alternating permutations? What makes them zigzag? So an alternating permutation of the numbers 1 through n is an arrangement of those numbers where each number is alternately greater than and then less than the number before it. For example, if we have the set 1, 2, 3, the alternating permutations would be 1, 3, 2, and 2 through 1, as well as their reverses. Right, because those arrangements create that kind of up-down, up-down pattern. Exactly, like a zigzag. And I remember that the number of these alternating permutations, often denoted by on, is connected to something called Euler numbers, which are different from the Euler totient function, right? That's right. The number of alternating permutations of 1 to n is often denoted by an, and these numbers are closely related to Euler numbers, specifically what are sometimes called Euler zigzag numbers or up-down numbers. Okay, got it. And there's a theorem, AndrÃ©'s theorem, that gives us this really neat way to represent these an numbers using an exponential generating function. Yes, AndrÃ©'s theorem gives us a really elegant formula for the exponential generating function of the sequence n. It says that the sum from n equals 0 to infinity of an times x to the n divided by n factorial is equal to sec x plus tan x. Secant and tangent, okay. I'm starting to see where the tangent in generalized tangent numbers might be coming from. You're right on track. The term tangent number actually comes from these alternating permutations. When n is odd, the number an is called a tangent number, and when n is even, it's called a second number. Oh, so that's the direct connection. And these names come from the way the tangent and second functions are represented as power series, right? Exactly. The Maclaurin series for the tangent function only involves odd powers of x, while the series for second only has even powers of x. This nicely matches up with the definitions of tangent and second numbers based on whether n is odd or even. That's a really cool connection. And there's also a relationship between these tangent numbers, the odd indexed ones, and the Bernoulli numbers, if I'm remembering correctly. Bernoulli numbers seem to pop up everywhere in number theory. You're absolutely right. The tangent numbers, those odd n numbers, are indeed related to Bernoulli numbers through various formulas. This highlights yet another fascinating connection between seemingly different concepts within number theory. So we have our sequence A000176 defined by this Dirichlet series and the Jacobi symbol, and we have this whole other world of alternating permutations counted by sequences related to tangent and second functions. How do these two areas of math come together? What's the bridge? That's the million dollar question. The OEIS entry doesn't explicitly tell us how to interpret dn2 combinatorially, but the name generalized tangent numbers heavily suggests a link to these tangent numbers, which are the odd indexed Euler's zigzag numbers. So you're saying that the dn2 numbers might be counting some kind of objects that are related to or a variation of these alternating permutations? That's the idea. It's like the Dirichlet series definition with its analytic machinery is hinting at some underlying combinatorial structure. Maybe there are specific types of permutations or arrangements that these dn2 numbers are counting. That's a really intriguing thought. So for our listeners, let's step back for a moment and talk more about Dirichlet series. We've mentioned they can be thought of as generating functions in combinatorics. What exactly makes them useful for counting things? Well, in combinatorics, generating functions are a powerful way to encode information about sequences. A Dirichlet series with its specific structure can be used as a generating function, particularly when you're dealing with combinatorial objects where the way you count them involves multiplicative properties. Multiplicative properties. Okay, so how does that work with a Dirichlet series? Often the coefficient of each term in the series, the n, represents the number of objects of a certain size n. And the fact that the denominator is n raised to the power s allows us to capture how those objects can be combined or built up from smaller components. This multiplicative aspect often arises when you're dealing with structures that are formed by putting together independent pieces. So in the case of our dirichlet
