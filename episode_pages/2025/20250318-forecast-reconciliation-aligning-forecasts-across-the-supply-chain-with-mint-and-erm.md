## Transcript

Welcome back to our series on modern supply chain methods. Today we're tackling a technique that I think could really significantly improve your forecasting accuracy and consistency. And we're talking about forecast reconciliation. Yeah, it's all about aligning those forecasts you generate at all those different levels. You know, like individual product demand at specific stores, regional projections, and ultimately, you know, up to your total national or even global sales forecasts. Yeah, I think that's something that many of our listeners can definitely relate to. You know, you've got these different forecasts, each of them valuable on their own, but they just don't always seem to add up neatly, do they? Exactly. You know, you have variations in data, different forecasting models, even just the inherent uncertainty of predictions. All that can lead to inconsistencies. And that's where forecast reconciliation really comes in. It's about creating a unified and coherent view of demand across, you know, your entire supply chain. So it's not just about, you know, making the numbers look pretty in a spreadsheet or anything like that. There are really serious operational implications here, aren't there? Absolutely. Imagine, you know, imagine your store-level forecasts for, you know, let's say a new product launch are a bit too optimistic, right? If those overestimations are sort of rolled up to the regional level, well, you might end up with distribution centers overflowing with inventory while other regions are facing stockouts. And these misaligned forecasts can really have like a ripple effect through your entire supply chain. And it ends up impacting everything, you know, inventory management, production planning, transportation, even customer satisfaction. Yeah, that's a really great point. It really highlights how interconnected everything is in the supply chain and the need for a really holistic approach to forecasting. But let's get into some specifics. How do we actually go about reconciling these forecasts? You know, I know there are some traditional approaches, but are they really effective? Yeah, you're right. There are those classic methods like, you know, bottom-up, top-down, and middle-out. Bottom-up basically means you're forecasting at the most granular level, like individual products in specific stores, and then aggregating those forecasts upwards. And it's pretty straightforward, but you tend to accumulate errors as you move up the hierarchy. Yeah, it's kind of like, you know, trying to weigh a group of people on a scale that's slightly inaccurate, and then adding up all those individual weights to get the total. And those small errors just really start to add up, don't they? Yeah, that's a good analogy. And then you have the top-down approach, and there you start with the highest level forecasts, you know, say total national demand, and then you disaggregate it down to those lower levels. The problem is this relies heavily on accurate disaggregation methods, which can be really challenging. Yeah, it's almost like trying to break down a national budget into individual spending categories and basing it solely on last year's proportions. It wouldn't account for new trends or shifts in consumer behavior, would it? Precisely. And then, of course, you've got middle-out, which tries to kind of strike a balance, right? Forecasting at an intermediate level and then both aggregating upwards and disaggregating downwards. It's trying to find a sweet spot, but it still has its limitations. So it sounds like these classic approaches, while, you know, they're a starting point, they aren't always the most reliable or efficient. Is there a better way? Is there something that's maybe more robust and mathematically sound? Well, that's where things get really interesting. There's a whole family of techniques known as minimum trace or minty and its variants. And these methods actually treat forecast reconciliation as a mathematical optimization problem. Optimization, okay. That sounds promising. It is. What mint aims to do is find the set of adjusted forecasts that minimizes the overall variance of forecast errors. So you're essentially making them as accurate as possible while ensuring that they add up correctly across all those levels of your hierarchy. It's kind of like finding the most statistically sound way to fit all those puzzle pieces together. So you're using the power of math to find the most accurate and consistent set of forecasts across all these different levels of our supply chain. Okay, but how does it actually work? What's going on behind the scenes? Well, mint relies on something called the covariance matrix of forecast errors. And this matrix, it captures not only how much each individual forecast might be off, but also how those errors are related, you know, across different time periods and different levels of the hierarchy. I think I understand the basic idea of a covariance matrix, but could you maybe break that down a little further for us? How does minty actually use this matrix to make those adjustments and ensure that everything is coherent? Sure, it's a bit like having a map of how all the different forecasts are connected and how their errors might influence each other. By analyzing this map, mint can identify where those adjustments are actually needed and how large those adjustments should be to create that unified and accurate forecast. Okay, that's a helpful way to think about it. But how do you actually estimate this covariance matrix in practice? I imagine it could get pretty complex, especially for larger hierarchies with lots of data. You're absolutely right. Estimating the covariance matrix is a crucial step, and it can be computationally challenging. A common approach is to use historical forecast errors, sometimes called residuals, to understand those relationships between different forecasts and how those errors have behaved in the past. So it's kind of like looking back at past forecasting performance to understand how those errors have typically played out and using that information to guide those adjustments. Exactly. And there are different ways to actually estimate this covariance matrix. You can use a simple identity matrix for OLS estimation, diagonal weights for WLS, or even more sophisticated methods like shrinkage estimators. But we'll talk about those a bit later. It sounds like there's a lot of flexibility in how you can really tailor these methods to fit your specific needs and data. But before we get into those more complex techniques, I'd like to get a better sense of how all of this translates into real-world benefits for our listeners. Can you give us some concrete examples of how forecast reconciliation, especially using Mint, has actually made a difference in supply chain operations? I'm really curious to see how these concepts actually play out in some real supply chain scenarios. Can you share some real-world examples where forecast reconciliation has made a tangible impact? Absolutely. Let's start with a case study from the retail industry. We had this large supermarket chain that was really struggling with inventory management, especially for perishable goods. And this was leading to significant waste and lost sales. So they decided to implement forecast reconciliation using Mint to align their forecasts across different product categories, stores, and time horizons. Oh, that sounds like a perfect application for these techniques. Perishable goods have such a limited shelf life. So accurate forecasting is crucial to minimize spoilage and waste. What were the results? Well, the results were actually quite impressive. By using Mint, they were able to reduce their forecasting errors by 15%, which translated into a 5% reduction in waste and a 2% increase in sales. Wow, those are some pretty compelling numbers. It really demonstrates the value of getting those forecasts aligned and coherent across the entire supply chain. Do you have any other examples, maybe from a different industry, that showcase just how versatile these methods can be? Certainly. Let's shift gears to the manufacturing sector. We had a global electronics manufacturer that was facing challenges in coordinating production across multiple factories and suppliers. They were experiencing delays, bottlenecks, and excess inventory because of misaligned forecasts for components and finished goods. Yeah, that's a really common problem for companies with these complex supply chains that span multiple locations and tiers. How did forecast reconciliation help them to address those challenges? Well, they implemented a hierarchical forecasting and reconciliation system using Mint. And this ensured that the forecasts for individual components, subassemblies, and the final products were all in sync. So it allowed them to really optimize their production schedules, reduce lead times, and minimize inventory holding costs across their entire network. So they were actually able to achieve that just-in-time ideal that so many manufacturers are striving for these days. It sounds like forecast reconciliation played a key role in really improving their overall operational efficiency. It really did. They reported a 10% reduction in lead times, a 5% decrease in inventory levels, and a 2% improvement in on-time deliveries. And it just shows how forecast reconciliation can be a really powerful tool for improving supply chain responsiveness and agility. These examples are so eye-opening. They highlight how forecast reconciliation can really benefit such a wide range of industries and address all these various supply chain challenges. But I'm curious, we've been talking a lot about Mint. Are there any other techniques that maybe our listeners should be aware of? Definitely. While Mint is a very popular and effective method, it's not the only one out there. There's a newer approach called empirical risk minimization, or ERM. And that's particularly useful when you're working with machine learning or other forecasting models that might be prone to bias. Yeah, we've heard a lot of buzz around machine learning and supply chain forecasting lately. It seems like ERM could be a pretty valuable tool to have in your arsenal, given the potential for bias in those models. Can you tell us a little bit more about how it works? Well, unlike Mint, which assumes that those base forecasts are unbiased, ERM acknowledges that those biases can exist. And it directly tries to minimize a specific error metric on your training data. So this allows it to actually find the best reconciliation, even when those initial forecasts are a bit off. That sounds very practical and data-driven. It's like acknowledging those imperfections in our forecasting models and then finding a way to work with them, rather than just pretending they don't exist. Exactly. And it's particularly beneficial when you're dealing with complex models or situations where you kind of expect
