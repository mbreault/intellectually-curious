## Description

In this Deep Dive we explore OEIS A000263, the sequence counting partitions of n into non-integral powers. Weâ€™ll walk through the OEIS entryâ€™s precise definition, notice the offset (A3 = 3, A4 = 14, A5 = 39, â€¦), and review the first terms (3, 14, 39, 91, 173, 307, 502, â€¦). The page shows how the values are computed, including sample Maple/Mathematica code that enumerates possible parts and uses floor-counting to tally valid pairs. Weâ€™ll also touch on the sequenceâ€™s historical thread: submitted by N. J. Sloan, tied to Sloanâ€™s Handbook (1973) and the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (1995), and continued by later contributors. If youâ€™re curious about how a combinatorial function gets catalogued in OEIS and how its computation is laid out, this episode walks through the entryâ€™s structure and the ideas behind it.

## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive, where we really try to get under the hood of complex ideas. If you're fascinated by numbers, especially if you're getting into number theory, you've probably bumped into the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. It's just this incredible resource, isn't it? Full of patterns, connections, things you just wouldn't expect. Oh, absolutely. It's like a huge interconnected library of numerical ideas, sequences that sometimes link math areas you wouldn't think are related, or even, you know, connect out to science. It really speaks to how interconnected things can be. Yeah, that interconnectedness is exactly what we love exploring here. So today, for you listening, maybe you're a student, maybe you're just curious, we're diving into one specific sequence, OEIS A000263, and the name itself, what makes you stop and think. Number of partitions into non-integral powers. Hmm, what on earth does that mean? How do mathematicians count something like that? Right, and that's our mission today, basically. To unpack A000263, we'll look at its precise definition, how you might actually compute it, and a bit about where it came from. And we're sticking just to the OEIS entry itself, showing how much information is packed in there. Okay, let's get started then. A000263, you might see old codes for it, like M2967 or N1200. That shows how things get catalogued over time. It kicks off with these terms, 3, 14, 39, 91, 173, 307, 502. It really takes off quite quickly. It does. The list goes on, 779, 1150, 1651, and so on, all the way up past 170,000 for the terms listed. And there's that note, offset 3.1. What's that telling us? Ah, yes, important detail. It means the first term listed, the 3, is actually A3. So the sequence index N starts at 3, not 1 or 0 like some others, so A3 is 3, A4 is 14, and so on. It's just a convention, but you need to know it to match the numbers to the definition properly. Right, makes sense. A3 is 3, A4 is 14. Got it. So the big question, partitions into non-integral powers. Let's break down that definition from the OEIS comment section. It says, An counts the solutions to the inequality by 1 12 plus by 2 12 equals N for any two distinct integers 1 equals by 1 by 2. Okay, let's unpack that piece by piece. Non-integral powers here specifically means the 12th powers, square roots. So not x squared, but square root of x. Exactly. And notice it's an inequality. We're looking for pairs of numbers by 1 and by 2 where the sum of their square roots is less than or equal to N. Not strictly equal to N. That's key. Less than or equal to N. Okay. And what about the by 1 and by 2 themselves? Right, they have constraints. They have to be integers. They have to be distinct. So by 1 can't be the same as by 2. And they're ordered. One must be less than or equal to by 1, which must be strictly less than by 2. So by 1 is always the smaller positive integer. Distinct ordered positive integers. And An is simply, well, it's the total count. How many pairs by 1 by 2 satisfy all those conditions for a given value of N? Can we maybe walk through the first one, A3? How does that work out? Yeah, good idea. So for N3, the inequality is squared by 1 plus squared by 2 was 3. We need one by 1 by 2. Let's try the smallest possible by 1, which is 1. Okay, everyone knows it. So squared by 1 plus squared by 2 was 3. That's 1 plus squared by 2. Subtract 1 from both sides. Squared by 2 was 2. Square both sides by 2 equals 4. Now remember the conditions. By 2 must be an integer, and by 2 must be strictly greater than by 1, which is 1. So by 2 could be 2, 3, or 4. Exactly. That gives us three pairs, 1, 2, 1, 3, and 1, 4. Ah, okay. That's three solutions. What if we try by 1 equals 2? Good question. If by 1 equals 2, the inequality is squared by 2 plus squared by 2 is about, what, 1.414? Yeah, roughly. So 1.414 plus squared by 2 was 3. That means squared by 2 must be less than or equal to 3.414, which is about 1.586. If we square 1.586, we get roughly 2.515. So by 2 must be less than or equal to 2.515. But we also need by 2 to be an integer greater than by 1 equals 2. Are there any integers between 2 and 2.515? Nope, not at all. So no solutions when by 1 will be 2. And if you tried by 1 equals 3, squared 3 is already about 1.732, leaving even less room for squared by 2. So you definitely won't find an integer by 2 greater than 3. So the only solutions for N are 3 came from by 1, 1. And there are exactly 3 of them. Precisely. Which matches a 3, 3. That makes it much clearer. Okay, so we see how it's defined, how those first terms come about. But calculating a 100 or 1,000 by hand like that, that seems tedious. Oh, incredibly tedious, impractical really. And that's where computation comes in and why the OEIS often includes code. Right, it mentions Maple and Mathematica code here. How does that work, generally speaking? Well, without getting lost in the exact syntax, the basic logic in both is pretty similar. They iterate through possible values for by 1. Usually they'd loop by 1 from 1 up to maybe N2, Y N2. Because if a by 1 was bigger than N2, then squared by would already be bigger than N, making the inequality impossible to satisfy since squared 2 is positive. Okay, that makes sense as an upper limit for by 1. Then, for each by 1, the code figures out the maximum possible value for by 2. It rearranges the inequality. It covers 2 N2 by 1. So X2 equals N minus what by 1. So A2 equals N squared by 1 2. Let's call this maximum possible value max 2. Calculate a max by 2 based on N and the current by 1. Exactly. But N2 also has to be an integer, and it has to be greater than by 1. So the code uses things like the floor function that just takes the integer part rounding down. It ensures by 2 is an integer and checks that the largest possible integer by 2, which is floor max by 2, is actually greater than or equal to by 1 plus 1, since it's by 2 by 1. Floor function, right, to get the integer part. And then comes the clever counting part. There's often a line like a plus floor max by 2 by 1 or something similar. Floor max by 2 by 1. How does that count the solutions? Let's think back to N3 and by 1, 1. We found the maximum by 2 was 4. So floor max by 2 by 1 becomes floor 4, 1, which is floor 3, which is 3. And we found three solutions, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4. It worked. Yes. What that floor max 2 by 1 calculation does is effectively count all the integers k such that i1k equals max 2. In our example, it counted k 2, 3, 4. It's a really efficient way to sum up all the valid by 2 values for that specific by 1 in one go. Wow, that's neat. A compact bit of code to do all that counting. It is. And the entry credits R.J. Mathar from 2009 and Jean-Francois Alcover from 2016 for these implementations. It shows the collaborative building on each other aspect of the OEIS community too. Absolutely. Okay, definition, computation. What about the history? Where did this sequence come from? Well, the entry itself was submitted by N.J. Sloan. Neil Sloan, the founder of the whole OEIS project. The man himself. Indeed. His Handbook of Integer Sequences from 1973 and then the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences with Simon Plough in 1995 were the precursors to the online database. Monumental work. And A000263 is listed in those original books. M2967 was its number in the 1973 handbook. I mean, if you think about how much work went into finding and cataloging these before the internet and easy computation. Definitely gives you some perspective. And there's a reference here that looks, well, really interesting. A paper. Yes. This is, I think, quite fascinating. It points to a paper by B.K. Agarwala and F.C. Olick. The title is Statistical Mechanics and Partitions into Non-Integral Powers of
