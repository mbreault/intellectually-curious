## Description

We explore A000164, the number of representations of n as a sum of three squares (with zero allowed) under the convention i â‰¥ j â‰¥ k â‰¥ 0. We discuss Legendreâ€™s three-square theorem, which n fail to be written as three squares, plus practical computation via the Ant Kingâ€“Somos formulas and generating functions, and how this fits into the broader landscape of representations by sums of squares, including connections to Lagrangeâ€™s four-square theorem and cryptographic applications.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our deep dive into the OEIS. Yeah, always a pleasure to be back. You know, our listeners are all number theory students. Right. So we don't need to spend too much time on the basics. We can jump right in. Today, let's unpack OEIS A000164. Ah, yes. A000164. It's a sequence and it counts the ways to represent a number as the sum of three squares. It's like a puzzle almost. You got it. Trying to fit square blocks together to reach a certain number. How many ways can you do it? Exactly. And this takes us straight into number theory. A field that's, well, fascinates both amateur math enthusiasts and Field Medal winners alike. And speaking of Field Medal winners, we have one right here with us today. Happy to be here. So let's get down to it. What exactly is A000164? Well, it's basically a list. And for every number, this list tells you how many ways you can break it down into the sum of three squares. Okay, so let's say we take the number 12, for example. Okay, 12. The sequence would tell us how many ways we can get to 12 by adding up three squares. Exactly. And we can use zero as one of the squares, by the way. So zero squared plus two squared plus four squared. That would be one way. That's right. You got it. And then there's also two squared plus two squared plus two squared, which also equals 12. You got it. There are two ways to represent 12 as a sum of three squares. So the sequence would list two for the number 12. Makes sense. The OEIS entry defines it as number of partitions of n into three squares, allowing part zero. Ah, yes. I have to admit, sometimes even I get a little lost in the language of math. It can be dense. Yeah, I know what you mean. So partition just means breaking the number into parts. Right. Smaller parts. And part zero just means we can use zero as one of the squares. Precisely. Okay, that helps. So what are some of the first few terms of the sequence? It starts with 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, and it goes on from there. Wait, there's a zero in there? There is. Does that mean some numbers can't be represented as the sum of three squares? You got it. The zero at the eighth position, that represents the number seven. Seven. Seven. You can try every combination, but you won't find three squares that add up to seven. Fascinating. Okay, now in the OEIS entry, there is a comment by Michael Somos. Oh, yes, Michael Somos. About how to actually calculate the terms of the sequence. And it says, An, number of triples of integers, i, j, k, such that i, j equals zero, and n equals i squared plus j squared plus k squared. Right. I think I need some help with that one. Sure, sure. What Somos is doing there is providing a more formal way of defining the sequence. Okay. It basically says that for any number, n, the corresponding term in the sequence, which we represent as An, is equal to the number of sets of three integers, i, j, and k. i, j, and k, okay. Where i is greater than or equal to j, j is greater than or equal to k, and all three are greater than or equal to zero. Such that the sum of their squares equals n. Okay, so it's like a mathematical shorthand for finding all those three square combinations. Exactly. A concise way to express the rule for generating the sequence. But it still seems like a lot of work to calculate this for every single number. Are there any shortcuts? Well, that's where it gets really interesting. Mathematicians have developed clever formulas and techniques to study these patterns. So they found ways to simplify the process. Exactly. And, you know, the OEIS entry actually has formulas by Ant King and Michael Somos that offer more efficient calculation methods. Interesting. These formulas really demonstrate the elegance of number theory, you know? By studying these patterns, we uncover these deeper truths about numbers. It's like there's a hidden order to it all. Exactly. There's a beauty to it. Okay, so I get that there are these patterns and there are formulas to help us understand them. But why is this sequence, and even number theory in general, so interesting to mathematicians? What's the point of figuring out all these different ways to represent a number? Well, number theory often presents these problems that are deceptively simple to state, but they're incredibly difficult to actually solve. I see. So there's a challenge there. Oh, absolutely. And the beauty is that these problems often connect to really profound ideas in other areas of mathematics. In other areas. Yeah, and even physics and computer science. For example, Lagrange's four-square theorem, which states that every natural number can be represented as the sum of four squares. Four squares? Four squares. This theorem has connections to sphere packing and lattice theory. Wow, so it's not just about the numbers themselves? No, no. It's about the bigger picture. It's about the broader mathematical landscape that they illuminate. It's like they're a key to unlocking other mathematical mysteries. Precisely. Number theory can be seen as a gateway to a deeper understanding of these mathematical structures and how they're all interconnected. This is fascinating, but let's talk about practical applications. I mean, does this abstract mathematical knowledge have any real-world relevance? It absolutely does, particularly in fields like cryptography. Yeah. Which is essential for online security. Really? Oh, yeah. Cryptography. Yeah, so when you make an online purchase or you access your bank account online, you know, encryption is what protects your sensitive information. Right. And these encryption algorithms, they rely heavily on number theory principles, including prime numbers and modular arithmetic. And those are connected to how we represent numbers as sums of squares. They are indeed directly related. So it's not just theoretical. It's actually helping to keep my online transactions secure. Exactly. And that's just one example. Number theory also plays a key role in coding theory, you know, which is about efficient and reliable data transmission and storage. And it has applications in things like random number generation, which is crucial for simulations and statistical analysis. It's amazing how these seemingly abstract number patterns have such a tangible impact on our everyday lives. It really highlights the power of mathematics to reveal the hidden order and connections that underlie our world. So we've been talking about formulas and calculations, but you mentioned generating functions earlier. What exactly is a generating function? Oh, generating functions? These are really powerful tools in mathematics, especially when you're studying sequences. Essentially, a generating function takes an entire infinite sequence and encodes it into a single mathematical object, typically a series. Okay, that's a bit abstract to me. Is there a simpler way to think about it? Sure. Let's say you have a jar, you know, full of different coins, pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters. Okay, I can picture that. A generating function for this jar, it would be a way to represent how many of each coin you have, all in one expression. Like a summary of the whole jar. Precisely. So, for example, you could have the expression x plus x to the fifth plus x to the tenth plus x to the twenty-fifth, and that could represent one penny, one nickel, one dime, and one quarter. I see the exponents, they represent the value of each coin. Right, and the coefficients, they tell you how many you have of each. Okay, that makes a lot more sense. So for A000164, the generating function lets us study the whole sequence, all the ways to break numbers down into three squares, without having to calculate every single combination individually. Exactly. It's a compact way to encapsulate the information of the entire sequence. For example, we could use the generating function to see, you know, how many ways the number 30 can be broken down into the sum of three squares. So we've got these formulas, we've got generating functions, and we talked about how A000164 connects to cryptography. That was pretty cool. Are there other sequences in the OEIS, other, you know, mathematical concepts that are kind of related to this one? Oh, absolutely. In mathematics, everything is connected, right? And the OEIS, it beautifully illustrates this interconnectedness. So if you look at the entry for A000164, there's a section called Cross-Refs. Cross-references. Yeah, and it lists a bunch of related sequences. For example, there are entries for the number of partitions into two squares. Two squares, okay. Four squares and five squares. So it's like a whole family of sequences, each one exploring the number of partitions, but for a different number of squares. Precisely. And by studying these related sequences, you know, we get a deeper understanding of the patterns, the properties of each individual sequence, and they give you additional context, more insights into the underlying mathematical structures. It's like getting a different perspective on the same problem. Exactly. Each sequence provides a different lens through which to view the underlying mathematical reality. Earlier, we were talking about Lagrange's four-square theorem. Could you tell us a little more about that? How does it connect to A000164? Sure. Lagrange's four-square theorem, it basically says that every natural number can be represented as the sum of four squares. Now, A000164, it focuses on three squares, right? But the connection is in this broader question of representing numbers as sums of squares. I see.
