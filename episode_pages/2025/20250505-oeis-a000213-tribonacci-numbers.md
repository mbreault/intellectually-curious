## Description

Delve into A000213, the Tribonacci numbers defined by Tn = Tn-1 + Tn-2 + Tn-3 with seeds 0,0,1 (and the common variant 1,1,1). Learn how the characteristic cubic r^3 = r^2 + r + 1 yields the Tribonacci constant r â‰ˆ 1.839286755... and why Tn/Tn-1 tends to r. We'll survey how to compute them efficientlyâ€”from naive recursion to memoized and bottom-up dynamic programming, with space-optimized versions and fast matrix exponentiation for large n. We'll explore generalizations to n-bonacci sequences, closed-form Binet-like formulas via the roots of the characteristic equation, and a variety of identities and congruence properties (the sequence modulo m is periodic, with the period depending on the prime factors of m). Along the way we touch on a surprising geometric connection: a 3-way self-similar tiling fractal where the Tribonacci constant appears as an eigenvalue of its defining matrix. Perfect for number theory students and curious math explorers alike.

## Transcript

Welcome back everyone to our deep dive into the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. It's really an indispensable tool for anyone studying number theory. Absolutely. It's fascinating just exploring it. Today we're zeroing in on one sequence, A000213. These are the Tribonacci numbers. Ah yes, a lovely sequence. Our mission essentially is to get a good handle on them, what they are, how you generate them, and maybe touch on some interesting properties. A solid intro for number theory students. Sounds good. And for those just tuning into the series, remember the OEIS isn't just a dry list. It's this huge network of sequences, and each one, like A000213, can open doors to some pretty deep mathematical ideas. Okay, so the name Tribonacci, it obviously makes you think of the Fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci adds the last two numbers. How do Tribonacci numbers work? What's the basic idea? Right, it's a very natural extension. Instead of the two preceding terms, you sum the three preceding terms. Three, okay. So if we call the sequence Tn, the rule is simply Tn equals Tn-1 plus Tn-2 plus Tn-3. That's for n being three or more. Got it. But you need starting points, right? Like seeds. Exactly. You need initial values to kick things off. A common way to start, and what we'll mostly stick with based on the sources like Geeks4Geeks, is T0 is 0, T1 is 0, and T2 is 1. 0, 0, 1. Okay, so let's walk through that. The next one, T3, would be 0 plus 0 plus 1, which is 1. Correct. Then T4 is 0 plus 1 plus 1, so that's 2. Yep. T5 would be 1 plus 1 plus 2, that's 4. Keep going. All right, then 7, 13, 24, 44. It grows pretty fast, faster than Fibonacci, it feels like. It does, yes. Significantly faster growth. And it's worth noting, Numberphile mentioned there's another definition some people use, starting with 1, 1, 1. Ah, okay. So slightly different sequence, but the same underlying rule. Precisely. The initial conditions are key. But sticking with the 0, 0, 1 start, to really understand the behavior of the sequence, not just the terms, we look at something called the characteristic equation. Right, this comes up with linear recurrences. Yeah. So for Tn, Tn-1 plus Tn-2 plus Tn-3, what's the equation? It's x cubed equals x squared plus x plus 1. x o is x, o is x5 plus x plus 1. Right. Okay, cubic equation. Why is that equation so central here? Well, the roots of that equation tell you a lot about how the sequence grows. Think about it. If the sequence grew perfectly geometrically, like r to the power of n, substituting that into the recurrence, Tn, Tn-1 plus Tn-2 plus Tn-3, would basically lead you straight to this cubic equation in r. Ah, I see. And this specific cubic has one real root, which is roughly 1.83929. And that's the Tribonacci constant. That's the one. It's analogous to the golden ratio phi for the Fibonacci sequence. Just like phi dictates the long-term ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, this Tribonacci constant dictates the growth ratio for Tribonacci numbers. So the ratio Tn over Tn-1 approaches about 1.839 as n gets large. Exactly. And this whole idea generalizes. You can have n-bonacci numbers where you sum the last n terms, leading to an nth-degree characteristic equation and its own constant. Fascinating. Now, something that really jumped out from the Numberphile source was this connection to something called the Rousey fractal. That seems like a big leap from number sequences to geometry. It does, doesn't it? It's quite remarkable. The Rousey fractal isn't built from the Tribonacci numbers directly piece by piece, but its structure is deeply connected. It's this fractal shape in three dimensions that has a really cool property. Right. You can break it down into three smaller versions of itself, just scaled differently. Whoa. Self-similar, but with three pieces instead of, say, two. Exactly. Three scaled copies tile the original shape perfectly. So where does the Tribonacci sequence or the constant fit into that picture? It comes in when you look at the mathematics behind that self-tiling, the transformations, the stretching and rearranging in 3D space needed to make those three copies fit, can be described using matrices. Matrix algebra, right. And it turns out that the Tribonacci constant, that 1.839 number, is an eigenvalue of the specific matrix used in constructing this Rousey fractal. An eigenvalue. Meaning it relates to how the matrix stretches or scales space. Precisely. It represents a scaling factor. So the rate at which things expand in certain directions related to building this fractal is governed by the same constant that governs the growth of the Tribonacci numbers. It's a beautiful, unexpected link. That really is amazing. Number theory and fractal geometry intertwined. Okay, so we have the definition, the constant, this cool fractal link. Let's get practical for a moment. If someone actually wants to compute, say, the 100th Tribonacci number, how would they do it? Right, calculation. Well, the most obvious way is just using the definition recursively, tn, tn-1 plus tn-2 plus tn-3. Just plug and chug. Yeah, but as sources like Geeks4Geeks point out, that's actually computationally terrible for large n. Why is that? Because you end up calculating the same smaller Tribonacci numbers again and again, many, many times. It leads to exponential time complexity. It gets very slow very fast. Okay, so simple recursion is out for big numbers. What's better? Dynamic programming is the standard improvement. You can do it top down with memoization, basically. You store the result the first time you calculate tk and just look it up if you need it again. So you avoid the recomputation. Exactly. Or you can do it bottom up with tabulation. Just build the sequence from t0, t1, t2 up to tn, storing as you go. Both get you linear time complexity. Much better. Linear time. Okay, that's efficient. Any other tricks? Geeks4Geeks also mentions a space optimized version. Since you only need the last three terms to find the next one, you don't actually need to store the whole sequence. Just keep track of three variables. Ah, clever. Less memory. Yep. And for really, really large n, there's an even more advanced method using matrix exponentiation. It leverages matrix multiplication to compute tn very quickly, often in logarithmic time relative to n. Wow, okay. So several tools depending on the need. Now let's zoom out a bit again. The sources, particularly one titled Properties of Tribonacci Numbers, hint at deeper properties and generalizations. Yes. The standard sequence, 0, 0, 1 start, sum of three terms, is just one example. You can generalize the recurrence itself. How so? You could have tn-n be tn-1 plus ctn-2 plus dtn-3, where b, c, and d are some constants. And you could also start with different initial terms, say p, q, and r. So you get a whole family of tribonacci-like sequences. Exactly. And the characteristic equation changes too. It becomes x to the b, x to the c, x to the d equals 0. And I bet there's a formula for tn in this general case too. Like Binet's formula for Fibonacci. There is. If the roots of that general cubic equation are, let's say, alpha, beta, and gamma, then tn is some combination like l alpha n plus m beta n plus n gamma, where l, m, and n depend on the starting values p, q, r. Correct. It gives you a direct formula, though finding those roots alpha, beta, gamma might be tricky. The paper also mentions nine specific special forms based on different starting conditions, just showing the variety. Interesting. What about identities? Fibonacci numbers have tons of identities relating different terms. Do tribonacci numbers have similar properties? They do. The properties paper lists several, for instance, involving determinants. You can set up matrices with tribonacci numbers like tn, tn plus 1, tn plus 2, and find relationships based on their determinants that shows there's a lot of internal structure. Determinant identities. Yeah. Okay. And it also mentioned a tribonacci field. That sounds quite abstract. It is getting into abstract algebra, yes. A field is basically a set where you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide following certain rules. The idea is you can construct such an algebraic structure using tribonacci numbers, which allows mathematicians to study them using powerful tools from field theory. It's quite advanced stuff. That definitely sounds like it. The paper also talked about congruence properties. What does that mean? Studying the modulo m. Yes, exactly. Looking at the remainders when you divide tribonacci numbers by some integer m. A key result, theorem in that paper, is that the sequence of remainders is always periodic. It eventually repeats. Ah, okay. It cycles. Yes. And theorem B says the length of that cycle depends on the prime factors of m. It relates the period modulo m to the periods modulo the prime powers dividing
