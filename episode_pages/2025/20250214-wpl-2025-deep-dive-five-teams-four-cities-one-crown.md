## Transcript

All right, welcome to another deep dive. Get your scorecards ready because today we're talking all things WPL, the 2025 Indian Women's Premier League. That's right, we've got a lot to cover from schedules and squads to some of the star players. So anyone new to the WPL, it's five teams, double round robin where everyone plays each other twice, then we've got the eliminator and of course the final. And this is actually the third season of the WPL, so it's really starting to gain some momentum. And one thing that's super interesting this year is the matches are being played in four different cities across India. That's a big change from the inaugural season where everything was just in Mumbai. Yeah, so we're going to see some real home field advantage come into play, think that'll change things up. Oh, absolutely. I think it's going to make the competition even more intense. Just imagine the energy in Bengaluru with RCB and their home crowd. Definitely. Okay, so let's get to the teams. We've got the Delhi Capitals led by Meg Lanning. They've been runners up twice in a row, so I think they're pretty hungry for a win this year. They've got a pretty strong batting lineup. Lanning won the orange cap in 2023. Yeah, and her partnership with Shefali Verma, they just broke records back in 2023. I think they put up something like 152 runs in a single match. That's incredible. So do you think keeping that core group together was a smart move? I think it's all about consistency, and they did add some new players and Sharani and Sarah Bryce, but we'll see how that goes. Okay, so what about the Gujarat Giants? They haven't had the best start in the first two seasons. Well, they're under new leadership this year with Ashley Gardner as captain. New captain, and they also signed Deandra Doughton and Simran Shaikh. Big names. Big names, yeah. Doughton sat out last season, so I'm curious to see how she does. And Shaikh is a rising star, but they spent a lot of money on just those two players. Almost 3.6 crore. It's a bold strategy. Definitely, definitely a bold strategy. And speaking of bold, the Mumbai Indians, the inaugural champions. Back again with Harmanpreet Kaur leading the team. They've got Nat Syverbrant, who was player of the final in 2023. And Hayley Matthews, the 2023 WPL MVP. Yeah, it's hard to top that kind of lineup, but they did lose Pooja Vastrakar due to injury, which is a bummer. But they invested in some young talent, too. G. Kamalini, a 16-year-old wicketkeeper batter for 1.6 crore. Wow, thinking about the future, that's interesting. Okay, what about the reigning champs? Royal Challengers Bangalore, led by Smriti Mandhana. They had an amazing run last year, and Elyse Perry was a huge part of that. Yeah, Elyse Perry just dominated. What was it, best bowling figures in WPL history? Six wickets for just 15 runs. It was unbelievable. Incredible, but they did lose Sophie Devine, and Asha Savana is out with an injury. Big losses. They did get Danny Wyatt in a trade from the UP Warriors, the first ever trade in the WPL. Oh, wow, really? First trade ever, that's a big deal. Alright, last but not least, we've got the UP Warriors. They've made it to the playoffs both seasons, but they have a big hurdle this year with their captain, Alyssa Healy, out with an injury. Big loss. How much do you think that will affect them? Well, Healy's leadership and her batting will I miss for sure, but they do have Deputy Sharma to take over as captain. Right, and she was the 2024 WPL MVP, so... Exactly, and they've still got Sophie DeKelstone, the world's number one T20 bowler, plus Tully McGrath, Grace Harris, Kior Navier. They've got a lot of talent. Oh, yeah, and they brought in Alana King and Chanel Henry, so they're still looking strong. Definitely, they have the potential to go far even without Healy. Looking at all these teams, what do you think will be the biggest deciding factor in who wins it all? It's hard to say. They all have their strengths and weaknesses. Delhi has that consistency. Gujarat has a new energy. Mumbai has the star power. RCB are the defending champions. And UP has this adaptability now. You're right, it really is anyone's game, but I think the schedule might give us some clues. Okay, so all the matches are at 7.30 p.m. Indian Standard Time, and the tournament kicks off on Valentine's Day, February 14th, at the Katambi Stadium in Vadodara. And what a way to start, Gujarat Giants versus the defending champions, RCB. Right off the bat, that's a big one. Can Gardner lead her new squad to victory against Mantana's title holders? That'll be a real test of Gujarat's new strategy, right out of the gate. And the very next day, we have Mumbai Indians versus Delhi Capitals at the same venue. Another high-stakes match early on? Can Harmanpreet and her team make a strong start against the two-time finalists? Should be interesting. Definitely. Then we move to the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. That's RCB's home ground. I'm really looking forward to February 21st. What's on the 21st? Mumbai Indians versus RCB in Bengaluru. Ooh, that's a big one. A clash of titans. Some of the biggest names in women's cricket going head-to-head. Yeah, I'll definitely be watching that one. And then it's off to Lucknow, where UP Warriors will have their home advantage at the Ikana Cricket Stadium. March 3rd, UP Warriors versus Gujarat Giants. It'll be interesting to see how Diti Sharma handles the pressure of captaining at home. For sure. And finally, we end up in Mumbai with the Eliminator on March 13th and the Grand Finale on March 15th at the Brayburn Stadium. What a tour. I think this multi-city format is fantastic, bringing the WPL to new fans all over India. I agree. It's so much more dynamic than that first season when everything was just in Mumbai. Okay, so speaking of dynamic, let's talk players. Who do you think is going to set this WPL on fire? There are so many incredible players to watch. We've talked about some of the big names leading the teams, but there are some other athletes you won't want to miss. All right, bring on the player powerhouse. I'm ready for a deep dive into some individual brilliance. Let's do it. Welcome back to our WPL deep dive. Last time we talked about all the teams and that super cool multi-city schedule. Yeah, and now it's time for the players, the ones who are really going to light this tournament up. Absolutely, individual brilliance. That's what makes the WPL so exciting to watch. Okay, so there's this one thing that I think about every season that hasn't happened yet, that WPL century. Oh, yeah. Two seasons in and no one has hit that 100 runs. It's crazy. Yeah, you think with all this talent, somebody would have done it by now. Right. I mean, Sophie Devine got so close in 2023. 99 runs. 99 runs off 36 balls. I remember watching that. I was like on the edge of my seat. So many sixes. Nine, nine sixes she hit. The Gujarat Giants bowlers must have been like, what is going on? And Alyssa Healy got close that season too. She scored 96 not out. It's wild that even these amazing players hasn't been able to crack that 100 yet. It shows how competitive it is. Everybody's playing at such a high level. So the big question, who's going to be the first to do it? We've got Meg Lanning, Sariti Mandana, Harmanpreet Kaur, Elise Perry, Talia McGrath. So many contenders. Yeah. Who do you think, any early favorites for you? Well, Meg Lanning, she's so consistent. She is. Orange cap winner in 2023. And she just knows how to build in innings and then accelerate when she needs to. Plus that partnership with Shefali Verma, they just click. 162 runs, that was unbelievable. I'm actually curious to see how this whole multi-city format impacts those partnerships. Oh, interesting. You know, being on your home ground, the crowd's cheering you on, maybe, you know, the pitch a little better. That could give some players a huge advantage. Yeah, that home field advantage could really change things up. But don't count out Smithy Mandana. No, she's such an elegant player. She's got all the shots and she's aggressive too. And she led RCB to back-to-back titles. That takes a lot of mental toughness. For sure. It's not just about the physical skill. It's that mental game, the focus, how you handle the pressure. Yeah, you have to adapt. Different conditions, different opponents. It's a lot. Totally. And that applies to the bowlers too. Absolutely. So who are we watching on the bowling side? Well, when it comes to taking wickets, you have to talk about Sophie Ecclestone. Oh, she's a force. She's amazing. Consistently one of the top wicket takers in the WPL. She's only 25. It's crazy how good she is. What makes her so good? I think it's a combination of things. Her control, her accuracy.
