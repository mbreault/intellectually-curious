## Description

We explore A000278, defined by a(n) = a(n-1) + [a(n-2)]^2 with initial values a(0)=0, a(1)=1. The sequence starts 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 16, 65, and its nonlinear square term leads to explosive, doubly exponential growth. Remarkably, the growth splits by parity: the even- and odd-index subsequences follow two distinct asymptotic tracks, with constants around 1.66875 and 1.69306, respectively. Beyond growth, A000278 counts certain combinatorial structuresâ€”forests built under recursive rulesâ€”giving a concrete interpretation to these colossal numbers. This is a striking example of how a simple nonlinear recurrence can encode rich structure and reveal subtle long-term behavior.

## Transcript

All right, listeners, welcome back to the deep dive. Today we're diving into the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS. And for you number theory students listening, we've got a really interesting one today, sequence A000278. Our mission basically is to unpack this sequence, see what makes it tick. So the definition looks, well, almost familiar at first glance. It's AN, AN1 plus AN2, that's for N2. And the starting values are simple, A0, 0, A1, 2, 1. But that little square on the AN2 term, that changes things quite a bit, doesn't it? Oh, absolutely. It changes everything. You know, you compare it to Fibonacci, which is just AN1 plus AN2. Adding that square seems like a small tweak, but the effect on the growth is dramatic. You can see it right away in the terms. It starts 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7. Then 16, 65. Exactly. They just skyrocket. And it's not just faster growth than Fibonacci's exponential rate. It's a completely different kind of growth. We're talking about something much more explosive. It really shows how these nonlinear terms can, well, blow things up mathematically speaking. It sort of challenges that intuition that small changes should have small effects. Right. Which leads to the question, does a sequence that grows this fast actually count anything concrete? You know, like we see with many OEIS sequences having combinatorial interpretations. That's a great question. And yes, it does. Research shows that A000278 counts the number of trees in certain kinds of recursively defined forests. So you can imagine this structure growing where the new additions depend quadratically on a previous state. It gives a tangible meaning to these incredibly large numbers. Okay, so it has a combinatorial side. But you mentioned the growth. When we look in the long run, the asymptotic behavior, that's where things get really interesting, right? The sources mentioned doubly exponential growth, but maybe not in the way you'd first expect. Exactly. Doubly exponential means the exponent itself is growing exponentially. So think C to the power of D to the power of N. Incredibly fast. But here there's a subtlety. The growth pattern actually depends on whether N is even or odd, which is quite unusual. Even or odd, so it doesn't settle down to one single rate. Precisely. For large N, the behavior splits. A2N, the terms with even indices, they behave like A raised to the power of square, raised to the power of 2N to 1, whereas A2N plus 1, the odd terms, they behave like B raised to the power of square, 2 raised to the power of 2. And A and B are different constants here. Yes, distinct constants. The OEIS lists them with quite high precision. A is roughly 1.66875 and B is about 1.69306. So the sequence sort of alternates between these two asymptotic tracks. Wow. Okay, so the parity, whether N is even or odd, fundamentally changes the long-term behavior. It does. And notice the square 2 appearing in those exponents. That's not an accident. It seems directly linked back to that squaring operation, the AN2-2 in the recurrence. It's a beautiful, if complex, illustration of how that non-linearity shapes the ultimate growth pattern. It really is amazing how much complexity is hiding in that simple-looking formula. And this sequence has attracted some serious attention over the years. Yes, people like W. Duke, Stephen Greenfield, Eugene Speer, they studied its properties. And Benoit Cloder did significant work clarifying that intricate asymptotic behavior, really pinning down this parity dependence. So wrapping this up, what's the big takeaway from A000278, this quadratic Fibonacci recurrence? Well, I think it's a fantastic example of how simple rules can generate just profound complexity. It's not just about the speed of growth, but the structure of that growth. This odd-even split is quite sophisticated. It definitely shatters any simple assumptions about how recurrences behave when you add nonlinear terms. Exactly. It reminds us that even in number theory, where we often look for universal patterns, sometimes the real beauty lies in the variations, the exceptions, the subtle details. And seeing how that squirt emerges naturally from the squaring, it really pushes you to look deeper beyond just the initial terms. A great reminder that there's always more structure hidden beneath the surface. Well, that's all the time we have for this deep dive. Until next time, keep exploring those numbers.
