Welcome back to Science Corner. To our deep dive series for the intellectually curious amateur scientists out there. Sounds good. Today we're going to be embarking on a pretty fascinating exploration, I think, into the world of the dragon curve. You might have encountered intricate self-repeating patterns before, but the dragon curve I think holds a particular elegance and appears in some really surprising places. Yeah, the dragon curve is really a quite remarkable mathematical object. It's a fractal, meaning it exhibits self-similarity at different scales, and it arises from a very simple iterative process. What makes it so compelling is its blend of simplicity in its creation and the complexity of the forms that it generates. And it pops up in all sorts of areas ranging from paper folding to very abstract mathematics. Absolutely. And who better to guide us through the intricacies of this mathematical dragon than a Nobel laureate whose work has in part touched upon this fascinating realm of fractal geometry. Welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to be here. Okay, let's start with the most well-known member of this family, the highway dragon. Now this wasn't some purely theoretical exercise, was it? Our sources indicate it has roots in some rather practical scientific endeavors? That's right. The highway dragon was first investigated by NASA physicists John Highway, Bruce Banks, and William Harder. Wow. They encountered it in their work, and it was Martin Gardner who then introduced it to a wider audience. Okay. Through his Mathematical Games column in Scientific American back in 1967. So this has been around for a while. It has. Following that, mathematicians like Chandler Davis and Donald Knuth further explored its mathematical properties in detail. Okay. And it even gained some popular recognition through its appearance on the section title pages of Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park, which is a rather unusual place to find a sophisticated fractal. A fractal gracing the pages of a dinosaur thriller. That's certainly a memorable connection. So for our listeners who are eager to visualize this, how do we actually construct the highway dragon? Let's start with the very basics. We begin with a simple line segment. Okay. The construction is recursive. Imagine taking this segment and replacing it with two new segments of the same length joined at a right angle. Okay. Now, the crucial part is the orientation. Right. With each subsequent iteration, as we replace every existing segment with this right angle shape, we alternate the direction of the turn by 45 degrees, first to the right, then to the left, and so on. So the very first step transforms our straight line into a sharp 90 degree bend. Exactly. Then in the next step, each arm of that bend is itself replaced by another 90 degree bend. That's right. But one will be angled 45 degrees clockwise relative to its parent and the other 45 degrees counterclockwise. That is exactly right. If you consider the image provided in our materials, you can see this iterative process unfold. The initial steps are quite straightforward, but as you progress to, let's say, the ninth iteration, the intricate dragon-like form with its characteristic twists and turns becomes clearly visible. Okay. And the self-similar nature begins to emerge. What's remarkable is how such complexity arises from this very simple rule applied repeatedly. It truly is. Now, for those of us who appreciate the language of mathematics, our sources also present a way to define the highway dragon using something called an iterated function system or IFS. This involves complex numbers, which might sound intimidating, but it's actually a very elegant way to capture the essence of the fractal. That's right. In the complex plane, the highway dragon is what is known as the attractor of two affine transformations, 1 plus i z2 and s e z 1 1 i z2. You can think of these as two simple rules that operate on points in the complex plane. If you start with just a basic set of points, say just zero and one, and you repeatedly apply these two functions to every point in that set, the resulting collection of points will progressively fill out the shape of the highway dragon. So it's like you're taking these two equations and they're like rubber stamping the dragon onto the complex plane? Yeah. It boils down this complex geometric construction into just two simple algebraic transformations. Okay. And this allows us to analyze the curve using the very powerful tools of complex numbers and linear algebra, revealing properties that might be hidden in the iterative geometric approach. That's a powerful way to think about it, reducing a complex shape to a couple of equations. And for those who prefer working with real numbers, our sources also mention a matrix form of this IFS. How does that relate to the complex number definition? For those more comfortable with linear algebra, these transformations can also be expressed using matrices. Okay. Operating on pairs of real numbers, x, y, which represent a point in the plane. Okay. x, x corresponds to a rotation by 45 degrees counterclockwise, followed by a scaling by a factor of one, two. Okay. The second transformation, x, x, involves a rotation by 135 degrees counterclockwise, the same scaling by a one, two, and then a translation by one unit in the x direction. Okay. These matrix forms essentially encode the rotation, scaling, and translation operations. Gotcha. In a different mathematical language, making it easier to perform these transformations computationally and connect them to concepts in linear algebra. So whether we're visualizing it step by step or defining it with these sets of equations, we have a clear picture of how the highway dragon is constructed. Right. But the story goes that its discovery wasn't through abstract equations, but through something much more hands-on, folding paper. Yeah. That's a wonderfully intuitive way to stumble upon such a sophisticated mathematical object. It's a beautiful example of how mathematical concepts can arise from very everyday activities. Right. The highway dragon was discovered by repeatedly folding a long, thin strip of paper in half, always folding in the same direction, say to the right. Okay. If you then unfold the paper and at each crease make a 90 degree turn. Okay. The sequence of turns you make, right or left, corresponds exactly to the sequence of segments in the iteratively constructed highway dragon. That's incredible. Can you give us a sense of what those turn sequences look like for the first few folds? Certainly. If you fold the paper once to the right and then unfold it, you'll have one right turn. Right. So the sequence is simply R. Okay. If you fold it again to the right and unfold, the sequence of turns is RRL. Okay. A third fold gives you RRL, RRR, L, and a fourth yields RRR, RRR, L, L, L. Oh, wow. You can start to see a pattern emerging in these sequences of right and left turns. Yeah. And there's a recursive rule that governs how these R and L sequences are generated with each additional fold, isn't there? Yes. Each iteration sequence is formed by taking the previous sequence, appending an R, and then appending a reversed copy of the previous sequence where all the L's and R's are swapped. Gotcha. This recursive rule perfectly mirrors the geometric construction of adding two segments at a right angle in alternating directions. Okay. Of course, as anyone who's tried to fold paper multiple times knows, you quickly reach a practical limit where the paper becomes too thick and unwieldy to fold sharply enough to perfectly represent higher iterations. I can only imagine the thickness after, say, nine folds. So we have this fascinating curve with its unique construction and surprising connection to paper folding. What are some of its key properties that make it so interesting and important in the world of mathematics? Well, one of the most striking features, as we touched on earlier, is its self-similarity. Imagine you take a magnifying glass to any sufficiently large part of the dragon curve. You would see a smaller version of the entire dragon, often tilted by 45 degrees. This self-similarity repeats at infinitely smaller scales. Wow. And the scaling factor between these copies is always the square root of 2, a fundamental mathematical constant that appears frequently in this context. Okay. The self-similarity is a hallmark of its fractal nature. Yeah. And leads to the intriguing property that many of its lengths, when appropriately scaled, are simple, rational numbers. It's like the mathematical equivalent of those Russian nesting dolls, but with an infinite level of detail. And I understand that these dragon curves aren't solitary creatures. Right. They can actually fit together to tile the entire plane without any gaps or overlaps. That's right. That seems counterintuitive for a line-like curve. It is a remarkable property. One way to visualize this tiling is to consider a standard grid of squares covering the plane, like a checkerboard. Okay, like a checkerboard. If you then replace each edge of every square with a segment of the dragon curve, oriented according to the color of the square at borders, these dragon curve segments will interlock perfectly, completely filling the two-dimensional plane. So despite looking like a one-dimensional curve winding and folding, because it can completely cover a two-dimensional area, it has a fractal dimension of exactly two. That is exactly right. That's quite a leap from the dimension of a simple line, which is one. In this context of space-filling through tiling, its fractal dimension is indeed two. Okay. And as a consequence of this tiling property, if you consider a highway dragon constructed from an initial segment of length one, the total area it encloses when it tiles the plane turns out to be exactly 12. Surprisingly clean and elegant result. That is a neat and unexpected value. Yeah. Now what about the boundary of this area filled by the dragon curve? Right. That edge must be incredibly convoluted. The boundary is indeed very intricate. It has infinite length, constantly folding back upon itself. Yeah. Its fract
