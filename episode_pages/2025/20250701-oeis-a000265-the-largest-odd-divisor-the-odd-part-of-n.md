## Description

In this Deep Dive, we explore A000265, the odd part of n obtained by removing all factors of 2. We explain the KÂ·2^J decomposition (N = KÂ·2^J with K odd), illustrate with examples, and show how A000265 is a multiplicative, strong-divisibility sequence. We'll reveal the fractal self-similarity inside the sequence, visualize its order with row-structures, and connect it to related OEIS entries like A07814. Finally, we discuss why isolating the odd part matters in number theory and how to compute A(n) from prime factorizations.

## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive. We're the show that helps you cut through the noise, get the key info, and, well, get you well-informed fast. Glad to be here. Today we're diving into maybe an overlooked corner of math, but one full of surprises. The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. You know, the OEIS. Ah, yes. A fascinating resource. It's like a library where every sequence tells a story. Exactly. And sometimes the simplest rules create these incredible patterns. Our focus today is one specific sequence, A000265. Now, the description sounds almost too simple. It says, remove all factors of 2 from n. Or you might see it as the largest odd divisor of n. Or even just the odd part of n. Right. Deceptively simple phrasing. It really is. So could you maybe break that down for us? What does it actually mean to remove all factors of 2? Sure. It's quite intuitive, really. Let's take a number, say 12. Okay, 12. To remove factors of 2, you just keep dividing by 2 until you can't anymore. Until you hit an odd number. So 12 divided by 2 is 6. Right. 6 divided by 2 is 3. And 3 is odd. Exactly. So you stop. The result for 12, the odd part, is 3. Now, if you start with an odd number, like say 7. Yeah. Well, there are no factors of 2 to remove in the first place. So it just stays 7. It isolates that core odd component of any integer. Got it. That makes perfect sense. So let's look at the sequence itself then. The first few terms of 000265 go like this. 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 3, 7, 1, 9, 5, 11, 3, 13, 7, 15, 1. I mean, looking at that, it just seems like a jumble of numbers, doesn't it? It can certainly appear that way at first glance. But there is a deep order hitting in there. Okay. And one small but crucial detail from the OEIS entry. The sequence offset is 1. Offset 1, meaning A1 is the first term we listed. Precisely. A1 is 1. That's important for correct indexing when we talk about its properties in number theory. It keeps everything aligned. Right. Good point. So our mission today really is to get under the hood of A000265. We want to understand its fundamental nature. Explore some of these surprising structures people have found. Absolutely. And figure out why this operation, just finding the largest odd divisor, why it's actually so significant in different parts of math. Think of this as your quick guide to getting properly informed about the odd part of N. Okay. So to really dig in, let's formalize that core idea slightly. Every positive integer N, as you know, has a unique prime factorization. Right. From that, we can always write N in a unique way as N equals K2J. Here, K has to be an odd number and J is just some non-negative integer power of 2. Okay. K2J. The sequence A000265, N, is simply that K. It's the odd bit left over after you factored out all the 2s. Ah, okay. So it's isolating the K. Exactly. Let's run through those first few terms again with this K2J idea. Good idea. For A1, well, 1 is just 1, 20. So K1, A1 is 1. Exactly. For A2, that's 1, 2, 1. So K is 1 again. A2, 4, 3, 3 is 3, 20. K is 3, so A3. For A4, 4 is 1, 2, 2. K is 1, so A4, 1. I see the pattern. What about, say, A6? Good one. 6 is 3, 2, 1. So K3, A6 equals 3. And A10? 10 is 5, 21. So K10 equals 5. It always pulls out that largest odd factor. That's very clear now. And what's really neat here is that while A000265 gives you the K, the odd part, there's actually another sequence, A07814, that gives you the J. Oh, the power of 2. Exactly. It tells you how many factors of 2 were removed. It's like every number has these two components. It's odd essence, K, and it's 2-ness, J. Huh, like coordinates. Kind of. And the simple decomposition, this K2J idea, it seems basic, but it leads to some, well, really profound properties. It's still kind of hard to imagine how just taking out the twos leads to complexity. But you mentioned surprising properties. Like I saw a note from Cary Mitchell calling it fractal. Yes, that's one of the most striking things about it. Fractal? How can a sequence of numbers be fractal? That sounds like geometry. It does, doesn't it? But here's the idea. It's quite elegant. If you look only at the terms with odd indices. So A1, A3, A5, A7, and so on. Exactly. What sequence do you get? You get 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Just the odd numbers. Precisely. The odd natural numbers. Okay, interesting enough. But here's the kicker, the really interesting part. If you remove those odd indexed terms from the original sequence, A000265. So you're left with A2, A4, A6. Yes. What you're left with is the original sequence, A000265, all over again. Wait, really? The exact same sequence? Essentially, yes. It reappears within itself. It's a form of self-similarity. That's the fractal-like nature Mitchell was talking about. Wow. Okay, that is surprising. The sequence contains itself. It's quite remarkable. It suggests this deep recursive structure baked right into the definition. And how did people even spot that? That's amazing. But the structural surprises don't stop there, right? I read about a tabular arrangement too from Marko Matosik and Alexander Povolotsky. That's right. Another way to see the underlying order. They described arranging it in rows. Okay. The idea is that every new row is the previous row interspaced with the continuation of the odd numbers. Okay, walk me through that. So row one is just one. Simple enough. Row two takes row one, which is just one, and interspaces the next odd number, three. So you get one, three, one. I see. You put the three in the middle. Exactly. Now for row three, you take row two, one, three, one, and interspace the next sequence of odd numbers, which are five and seven. So one, then five, then three, then seven, then one. Precisely. One, five, three, seven, one. Okay, I get it. And row four would use nine, 11, 13, 15. You got it. One, nine, five, 11, three, 13, seven, 15, one. It builds the sequence in this layered, recursive way. That's a neat visualization. What about the comment from Pavlovsky about the ones at the ends? Right. He noted that sometimes in drawings, those leading and trailing ones might be considered fictitious or added just for symmetry. But the core generation process filling in the gaps with odd numbers, that defines the structure. Fascinating. And there was yet another structure mentioned. Paul Kurtz saw it as a truncated triangle. Yes, another geometric perspective. And what's significant there is that the columns and diagonals of that particular arrangement connect directly to several other sequences in the OEIS. Like A069834, A213671. Hold on. Exactly. A23699, A1256, A0. It just shows how interconnected these things are. A000265 isn't just isolated. It's like, well, a building block that appears in many different mathematical molecules. It really drives home that OEIS web of connections. So, okay, beyond these cool structures, what about its core mathematical properties? What makes number theorists particularly interested in A000265? Well, one absolutely crucial property is that it's a multiplicative sequence. Multiplicative. Okay, what does that mean practically? It means that if you take two numbers, N and M, that are relatively prime, meaning they don't share any common factors other than 1. Like 3 and 5. Perfect example. Then the odd part of their product, ANM, is simply the product of their individual odd parts, AN times AM. So A3, 5, which is A15, should be A3, A5. Let's check. A3 is 3, A5 is 5, so A3, A5 is 3, 5, is 15. And A15. Well, 15 is already odd, so its odd part is just 15. It works. It does. This property is incredibly useful. It lets you figure out AN for large N by breaking it down into its prime factors. Ah, very handy. And it goes even deeper. It's what's called a strong divisibility sequence. Strong divisibility. Okay, that sounds impressive. It is. It means something quite profound. The greatest common divisor, GCD, of any two terms, say AN and AM, is
