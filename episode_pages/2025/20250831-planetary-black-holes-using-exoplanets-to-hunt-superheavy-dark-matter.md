## Description

<p>In this deep dive, we explore a provocative idea: giant, cold exoplanetsâ€”especially gas giantsâ€”as cosmic detectors for superâ€‘heavy dark matter. Particles streaming through a planet could be captured, sink to the core, and, if enough accumulate, collapse into a black hole. The outcomes could be dramatic: the planet could be consumed via accretion, or a tiny evaporating black hole might heat the world or emit highâ€‘energy signals. We unpack the mechanism, the possible observational fingerprintsâ€”altered transits, microlensing signals, or bursts of highâ€‘energy particlesâ€”and why this August 2025 work by Fortamehr and Featherolf offers a compelling, complementary path to probing dark matter using planets as living laboratories.<br><br>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/qkwt-kd9q">https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/qkwt-kd9q</a></p>

## Transcript

Imagine distant worlds, not just orbiting stars, but acting as these huge natural detectors, probing one of the universe's biggest mysteries, dark matter. Today in this deep dive for the intellectually curious, we're looking into this really amazing idea of using exoplanets to search for super heavy dark matter. And this hunt, well, it could actually end up creating black holes inside these planets. Yeah, it sounds pretty wild, but it's based on solid theoretical work. This comes from a very recent paper, actually. It's called Probing Super Heavy Dark Matter with Exoplanets by Mehrdad Fortamehr and Tara Featherolf at UC Riverside, just published this August. Right, so our mission for you today is to really unpack how these, well, exotic worlds might unlock secrets about the invisible universe and what kind of extraordinary, even dramatic consequences this could have for the planets themselves. So let's start there. Why exoplanets, specifically the big gassy ones? What makes them so perfect for this kind of search? Well, it really comes down to a couple of key things. Gas giants, they're ideal because they have these immense volumes, right? And crucially, very low internal temperatures. See, unlike stars or even, say, brown dwarfs, these isolated cold exoplanets don't have much internal heating from fusion or anything like that. So that makes their baseline temperature really, really stable and cold. They're incredibly sensitive to any kind of new energy source, like dark matter interactions potentially heating them up. Okay, so they're vast and cold, acting like sensitive thermometers. Does it matter where they are or just how many there are? Oh, absolutely. Both matter. First, their sheer number. We've found thousands already, and there are likely billions, maybe trillions out there. That gives us a lot of potential detectors, statistically speaking. And location is key, too. You mentioned that. Planets closer to the galactic center are particularly interesting targets. Why there specifically? Because that's where we think the density of dark matter is much higher. More dark matter means, you know, a higher chance of these interactions happening. Ah, okay. Higher density, more chances to catch something. And we're not just talking about any dark matter, are we? The paper specifies super heavy dark matter. Why that distinction? Precisely. Yeah, this method is really tailored for super heavy dark matter particles. We're talking masses greater than about 106 GeV, which is enormous for a particle. The super heavy part is critical because it influences how they interact. As a planet moves through this sort of halo of dark matter around the galaxy, these specific heavy particles, if they have the right properties, can scatter off the nuclei inside the planet. They lose kinetic energy in these collisions, like cosmic billiard balls. Sort of, yeah. If they lose enough energy, their speed drops below the escape velocity of the planet, and they become gravitationally captured. The planet basically acts like a giant net. Okay, so they get caught in this planetary net. What happens then? Do they just stay there? This is where it gets really interesting. Unlike some types of dark matter that might annihilate each other, this specific kind, non-annihilating super heavy dark matter, doesn't do that. So it just builds up. It accumulates over time. These captured particles eventually sink, they thermalize with the planet's core, and they gather together, forming this dense clump right at the center. A clump of dark matter growing at the core, and if that clump gets big enough... Exactly. If it gathers enough mass, surpasses a certain critical threshold, it can gravitationally collapse under its own weight, and boom, you get a black hole forming right there inside the exoplanet. A black hole formed inside a planet. That's quite a concept. How fast could that happen? Well, the paper suggests it could be surprisingly fast. In some scenarios, for a planet maybe 13 times the mass of Jupiter, it could happen in as little as 10 months, once accumulation starts in earnest. Wow, okay. So a planet basically births its own black hole. What then? What happens to the planet? The paper mentions two possibilities, right? Accretion or evaporation. That's right. Two very different potential fates. In the first scenario, accretion, the new black hole starts feeding. It begins pulling in the surrounding planetary material, the gas, the core itself, and grows larger. Eventually, this could lead to the entire planet being consumed. It effectively transforms into a planetary-mass black hole. The gas giant is just gone. Annihilated. So a missing planet in a survey could theoretically be a clue. It's one possibility, yes. Or perhaps a change in its observed properties over time. The other path is evaporation. Hawking radiation. Exactly. If the initial black hole formed is relatively small, below a certain mass threshold, Hawking radiation could dominate over accretion. It would slowly evaporate, releasing energy in the form of high-energy particles, photons, electrons, neutrinos. These could escape into space, maybe detectable as high-energy cosmic rays, or they could actually heat the planet from the inside out, causing observable temperature changes. So we have planets potentially vanishing or planets maybe glowing or pulsing with high-energy particles. How could we actually detect these effects from Earth? What are the signatures? Good question. For the accretion case, where the planet turns into a black hole, one sign could be, as you suggested, a drop in observed transit events. You know, where we see a planet passing in front of its star. If the planet becomes a much smaller black hole, that transit signal could disappear or change drastically. We might also see effects in gravitational microlensing surveys, though distinguishing a planetary-mass black hole signal from a regular planet can be really challenging. Future surveys, like with the Roman Space Telescope, might give us the population statistics needed. Okay, that's for the vanishing act. What about the evaporating ones? For the evaporating black holes, we might look for periodic bursts of high-energy cosmic rays coming from the direction of known exoplanets. Or, perhaps more directly, we could observe periodic variations in the exoplanet's surface temperature caused by that internal heating from the evaporating black hole. What's really exciting about this whole approach is that it gives us a completely new way to look for dark matter. You know, it's complementary to the searches we do here on Earth in labs or through cosmological observations. It probes different mass ranges, different interaction types. It really broadens the search. It really does. This deep dive shows that exoplanets aren't just distant worlds. They could be active cosmic laboratories. Places where dark matter, this incredibly elusive stuff, might actually be making its presence known. It leaves you with a pretty provocative thought, doesn't it? What if the characteristics we observe in some exoplanets, their temperature, maybe even their absence where we expect one, what if that's actually a sign? A sign of super-heavy dark matter working away inside, transforming the planet right under our cosmic noses.
