## Description

What is A000107? It counts rooted trees with exactly one distinguished (labeled) vertex â€” the pointed or vertebrate rooted tree. The early terms are 0, 1, 2, 5, 13, 35, and the numbers grow rapidly as you add nodes. The combinatorial meaning is: pick a rooted tree and mark one node. Its ordinary generating function is A000081(X) / (1 - A000081(X)), linking it to the classic sequence of unlabeled rooted trees. Beyond counting, there are fascinating connections to circle arrangements in the plane studied by Mathar and to asymptotic growth formulas. Pointed rooted trees also surface in computer science (think file hierarchies) and biology (branching patterns in natural systems), showing how a single labeled node unlocks a rich structure. Join us as we explore the depth and beauty of this OEIS entry.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into the OEIS. For all you number theory students out there, today we're tackling a sequence. We're going to unpack a sequence that's sure to pique your interest. That's right. A000107. It's amazing how much depth you can find in even the simplest looking sequences in the OEIS. Absolutely. A000107 might just look like a list of numbers at first glance. Right. It actually encodes information about something called rooted trees. Okay, so right off the bat, I think it'd be helpful for our listeners if we start with a clear definition. Sure. What exactly do we mean by a rooted tree in this context? Imagine you're looking at a family tree. You have a single ancestor at the very top. And from that ancestor branches descend to their children, grandchildren, and so on. That ancestor at the top, that's your root. I see. In more formal mathematical terms, a rooted tree is a tree graph with one vertex designated as the root. So the root gives us a starting point, a point of reference from which the rest of the tree branches out. Okay, now how does that play into A000107 specifically? So A000107 is all about counting the number of rooted trees that have a certain number of nodes but with a twist. Okay. In these trees, one node and only one is special. It's labeled. So it's like we're highlighting one individual in that family tree. Exactly. Marking them as significant in some way. That's a great way to put it. But before we dive into that labeled node aspect, let's take a look at the sequence itself. The first few terms are 0, 1, 2, 5, 13, 35. And already you can see the numbers are growing pretty rapidly. Yeah. Think about it. As you add more nodes, the number of ways you can arrange those nodes into a rooted tree with one special labeled node explodes. And there's a formula to capture this pattern, right? Something called a generating function. Exactly. Think of a generating function like a DNA sequence for this mathematical object. Okay. It encodes all the information about A000107 in a single compact form. Wow. In this case, the generating function is A000081 of X over 1 minus A000081 of X. Now that formula looks a bit intimidating. But I think what's really interesting here is the connection to A000081. Right. That's another sequence in the OEIS, right? Absolutely. A000081 counts the number of all rooted trees with a given number of nodes without any labeling requirement. Okay. So you can think of A000107 as building on top of A000081. I see. We're taking all those possible rooted trees and then saying, okay, let's choose one special node to label. So it's like we're adding an extra layer of complexity, an extra dimension to the problem. That's right. We're not just interested in the structure of the tree itself, but also in the special role that one particular node plays. Exactly. And this is all captured in the generating function, which gives us a way to analyze the sequence's behavior in a very elegant way. It really is quite elegant. It's fascinating how these seemingly simple concepts of trees and labels lead to such rich mathematical structures. It is. It's really quite amazing. I think what's really cool is that this idea of a rooted tree with a labeled node... Yeah. ...isn't just some abstract mathematical curiosity. It actually has applications in other fields like computer science. Absolutely. Think about how files are organized on your computer. You have a root directory, and from there you have folders within folders creating a hierarchical structure that's essentially a rooted tree. And you might even have special files or folders that are labeled or flagged in some way, which connects back to the idea of a labeled node in our sequence. That's fascinating. Yeah. It's really cool how these concepts can be applied in such different areas. So we're seeing these pointed rooted trees, as they're sometimes called, popping up in unexpected places. Yeah. And I understand there's another term used to describe them, one that might surprise you. Okay. Vertebrates. Yes, and I know what you're thinking. Vertebrates like animals with backbones? Right. What do fish and birds have to do with rooted trees? Well, in this mathematical context, vertebrate is just another way of describing a rooted tree with a single distinguished node, that labeled node we've been talking about. It's like that node becomes the head of the tree, making it distinct from all the others. So it's a way of visualizing these structures, giving them a more concrete feel. Yeah. But it's more than just a visual analogy, right? I remember seeing something in the OEIS entry about a connection to circles. Oh, yeah. How do circles fit into all of this? That's where it gets really interesting. There's a fascinating link between rooted trees and the arrangement of non-intersecting circles in a plane. Okay. The OEIS entry cites some work by R.J. Mathar, who explores this connection. It turns out you can use rooted trees to represent and analyze these circle arrangements, which might seem completely unrelated at first glance. That's amazing. So we're going from family trees to computer files to circles. Right. All connected by this underlying concept of a rooted tree with a labeled node. It's really quite remarkable. It really highlights the interconnectedness of mathematics. Yeah. How seemingly disparate ideas can be linked in surprising ways. Absolutely. And I know the OEIS entry for A000107 also mentions an asymptotic formula. Can you explain what that is and why it's important? Sure. An asymptotic formula tells us how a sequence behaves as its terms get very large. Okay. It's like getting a glimpse into the sequence's long-term trends. I see. In the case of A000107, the asymptotic formula provided by Vaklav Kotezevich reveals that as the number of nodes in our tree grows very large, the number of possible pointed rooted trees explodes at an incredible rate. So it's not just that the sequence grows. Right. It grows in a very specific way that we can actually describe mathematically. Exactly. And this formula gives us a powerful tool to understand that growth without having to calculate each individual term. That's right. It's very powerful. But let's go back to the generating function for a moment. I know we touched on it briefly, but I think it deserves a bit more attention. Sure. It's more than just a formula, isn't it? It's a way of encoding a lot of information about the sequence in a very compact form. Absolutely. You're right. The generating function for A000107 is like a blueprint containing all the essential information about the sequence. And if you know how to read that blueprint, you can extract all sorts of insights about the sequence's properties and behavior. For example, you can use the generating function to derive relationships between different terms in the sequence or to find formulas for specific terms without having to calculate them directly. Yeah, you can do all sorts of things. It's a really elegant and powerful tool. It really is. But for listeners who might not be familiar with generating functions, how would you explain their significance in a simple, intuitive way? Imagine you have a complicated machine with lots of moving parts. Okay. A generating function is like a schematic diagram for that machine. It shows you how all the pieces fit together and how they interact with each other. I see. And just like a skilled engineer can use a schematic to understand and manipulate a complex machine, a mathematician can use a generating function to analyze and manipulate a complex sequence. It's like having a master key that unlocks the secrets hidden within the sequence. Exactly. And speaking of secrets, I'm curious about the real-world applications of these pointed rooted trees. Okay. We've already touched on computer science, but I understand they also have implications for biology. That's right. Think about the branching patterns you see in nature. The network of blood vessels in your body, the intricate structure of a tree's roots, or the way neurons connect in your brain. Yeah. These are all examples of tree-like structures, and understanding the mathematical principles behind their growth could lead to some fascinating insights. So the way a tree branches out to maximize its exposure to sunlight. Right. Or the way blood vessels form to efficiently transport nutrients throughout the body. Could these processes be modeled using the same mathematical framework that describes A000107? That's a question that researchers are actively exploring. Wow. And if we can unlock those connections, it could have significant implications for fields like medicine and bioengineering. Imagine being able to design more effective drug delivery systems or create artificial tissues that mimic the complex branching patterns found in nature. It's amazing to think that a sequence that started with counting rooted trees could have such far-reaching applications. It is. It's really incredible. It really highlights the power of abstract mathematics to illuminate the world around us. Exactly. And it underscores the beauty of the OEIS. It's not just a collection of numbers. It's a portal to a vast and interconnected world of mathematical ideas. So to wrap things up for our listeners today, let's take a moment to reflect on what we've learned about A000107. Okay. We started with a simple definition, the number of rooted trees with a single labeled node. Right. But from there, we've journeyed through a landscape of surprising connections. We have. From computer file systems to the arrangement of circles in a plane and even into the realm of biology. It's been quite a journey. We've delved into the power of generating functions. Those mathematical blueprints. Exactly. That encode the essence of a sequence. And we've glimpsed the long-term behavior of A000107 through its asymptotic formula. Powerful stuff. And along the way, we've seen how a seemingly abstract mathematical concept can have unexpected applications in the real world. Absolutely. It's one of the things that makes math so fascinating. So as you continue your exploration of number theory
