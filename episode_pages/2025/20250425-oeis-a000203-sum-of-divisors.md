## Description

Sigma(n) is the sum of all positive divisors of n (including 1 and n itself). It is multiplicative: if gcd(a,b)=1 then sigma(ab)=sigma(a)sigma(b), and for a prime power p^a we have sigma(p^a)=1+p+p^2+...+p^a=(p^{a+1}-1)/(p-1). Thus sigma(n) for any n with prime factorization n=‚àèp_i^{a_i} is the product sigma(n)=‚àè(p_i^{a_i+1}-1)/(p_i-1). We'll walk through examples like n=6 (sigma=12) and n=12 (sigma=28), compare with the divisor-counting function A000005 and the aliquot sum A001065, and discuss how the sum-of-divisors classifies numbers as perfect, abundant, or deficient. A key fact: sigma(n) is odd iff n is a square or twice a square. We‚Äôll also touch connections to lattices and groups (counting sublattices of index n, etc.), the Dirichlet generating function sigma(n) ~ zeta(s)zeta(s-1), and common clarifications (for example, not all ‚ÄúEuler-type‚Äù recurrences are for sigma).

## Transcript

Welcome back to the deep dive. We're continuing our journey through the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, focusing today on a sequence that's just absolutely fundamental if you're digging into number theory. That's OEIS A000203. It really is a cornerstone. A000203 gives us an to find S sigma n, and sigma n is simply the sum of all the positive divisors of n. That includes 1, and it includes n itself. You'll sometimes see it written as sigma subscript 1, so sigma 1 n. And today, yeah, our mission is basically to unpack this, look at the definitions and some key properties, and really get a feel for why this sequence, which sounds pretty simple on the surface, is actually so significant. Okay, let's start right there. Sigma n, sum of the divisors. Can we just walk through a really basic example? Like, what about n equals 6? Good place to start. For n 6, the positive divisors are, well, you've got 1, 2, 3, and 6 itself. Add those up, 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 6, that gives you 12. So sigma 6 is 12, simple as that. Okay, 12, straightforward. Now when you look at the OEIS entry, it immediately points to related sequences. There's sigma n, and also something called the aliquot sum, difescent. How do these fit in, or differ, I guess? That's a really good point to clarify early on. Sigma n, that's sequence A00005 in the OEIS, isn't about summing, it's about counting. It tells you how many positive divisors n has. Ah, okay, the count. Exactly. Then the aliquot sum, sm, which is A001065, is the sum of the divisors excluding n itself, so just the proper divisors. Right, right, excluding n. Let's take n 12, maybe. The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Okay. So sigma 12, the count is 6, there are 6 divisors. Sigma 112, our main sequence today, is the sum, 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 6 plus 12, that adds up to 28. 28, got it. And then the aliquot sum, S12, would be just the sum of the proper divisors, 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 6, which is 16, or, you know, simply sigma 112 minus 12, so 28 minus 12 is 16. That makes sense. Count, sum of all, sum excluding the number itself. It helps to see them side by side. Okay, let's dig into sigma itself. A really important property mentioned is that it's a multiplicative function. What does that actually mean for us? Yeah, multiplicative. This is incredibly useful. It means if you take two numbers, let's call them A and B, and they don't share any common prime factors, their greatest common divisor, GCD, is 1. They're co-prime. Exactly, co-prime. Then sigma of their product, sigma AB, is just sigma A multiplied by sigma B. You can calculate the sigma for each part separately and then just multiply the results. Okay, that sounds handy for calculations. Yeah. Does it tell us something deeper, though? Oh, absolutely. It's fundamental because it lets us compute sigma directly from the prime factorization of N. Any integer N can be written uniquely as a product of prime powers, right? Like P1 to the power A1 times P2 to the power A2 and so on. Standard prime factorization. Precisely. Because sigma is multiplicative, sigma N will be the product of sigma applied to each of those prime power components. So it's sigma P1 A1 times sigma P2 A2 times... You get the idea. Okay, and what's sigma of a prime power, like sigma Pa? Well, the divisors of Pa are just 1, P, P squared, all the way up to Pa. So sigma Pa is just the sum, 1 plus P plus P2 plus Pa plus Pa. Okay, so sigma N is a product of those sums, one for each prime factor. That still feels like it could be a bit messy to calculate if the powers are large. Is there a shortcut for that sum? Yes, there is. That sum, 1 plus P plus P2 plus P3 plus Pa, is a geometric series. And there's a very nice closed formula for it. It equals P to the power of A plus 1 minus 1, all divided by P minus 1. Ah, the geometric series formula. Exactly. So to get sigma N for any N, you find its prime factorization, say N equals P1 A1, P2 A2, and then sigma N is the product for I, from 1 to R, of these fractions, Pi plus 1, 1, Pi 1. Let's try that on our N12 example again. 12 is 2 squared times 3 to the power 1. Perfect. So using the formula for the 22 part, we get 2, 2 plus 1, 1, 2, 1, that's 23, 1, 1, which is 8, 1, 1, equals 7. Okay, so for the 3, 1 part, we get 3, 1 plus 1, 1, 3, 1, that's 32, 1, 2, which is 9, 1, 2, equals 8, 2, equals 4. Right. And since sigma is multiplicative, sigma 22, sigma 31, 4 equals 28. Which is exactly what we got just by summing them up earlier. Much cleaner with the formula, especially for bigger numbers, I imagine. Definitely. That multiplicative property and the resulting formula are workhorses in number theory. Okay, so that's a core property. But the OEIS entry, like you said, hints at broader connections. Sigma isn't just about primes and divisors in isolation, is it? Not at all. One of the oldest connections, going way back, is how sigma relates to classifying numbers. You know, perfect numbers, abundant numbers, deficient numbers. Ah, yes, the Greek classification. Exactly. A number n is called perfect if the sum of its divisors, sigma n, is exactly twice the number itself, 2n. If sigma n is greater than 2n, it's abundant. If sigma is less than 2n, it's deficient. Like 6 is perfect because 6 plus 6 is 12, which is 2 times 6. And 12 is abundant because sigma 12 equals 28, which is more than 2 times 12. Precisely. And these classifications, defined purely by sigma, lead to fascinating questions like, are there any odd perfect numbers? Still an open problem, believe it or not. Wow. Okay, that's a classic link. But the entry also mentioned connections to lattices and group theory. That feels like a different world entirely. It does, doesn't it? But it's true. Here's a rather unexpected one. Sigma n counts the number of sublattices that have index n within a standard two-dimensional integer lattice, like z cross z. Sublattices, so like sparser grids within the main grid. Kind of, yes. Imagine the standard grid of points with integer coordinates. A sublattice of index n is basically a grid generated by two vectors such that the area of the parallelogram they form is n times the area of the basic unit square. Sigma n tells you how many distinct ways you can form such a sublattice. That's surprising. Isn't it? And there's an equivalent group theory interpretation. Sigma n is also the number of subgroups of index n in the group z xc, the direct product of two infinite cyclic groups. And maybe even more concretely, it's also the number of subgroups of order n in the group cn xn, which is the direct product of two cyclic groups of order n. It's quite remarkable that summing divisors relates to counting these kinds of algebraic structures. Truly remarkable. It really connects different areas. Are there other surprising places sigma shows up? Well, there's a connection to p-adic numbers too. Okay, now you're really stretching things. Hey, maybe a little. But if you take a prime p that's larger than n, sigma n actually counts the number of field extensions over the p-adic numbers qp that have degrees n sitting inside the algebraic closure of qp. It just keeps popping up. It really does. It seems woven into the fabric somehow. The OEIS page also mentions an Euler recurrence relation. That sounds more computational again. Yes, Euler found this ingenious way to calculate sigma using values of sigma for smaller numbers. It involves summing terms related to sigma n, where the k values are the so-called generalized pentagonal numbers. Pentagonal numbers, yeah, 1, 5, 12. Those are the regular ones. The generalized ones include values like 3i2i2 for both positive and negative integers i, so you get 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, and so on. The recurrence is sigma n equals a sum involving alternating signs and terms like sigma n pi, where pi are these generalized pentagonal numbers. It's quite elegant, actually. Interesting, a recursive definition. What about simpler properties? Like when is sigma itself an odd number? Ah, yes, there's a straightforward condition for that. Sigma n is odd if and only if n is a perfect
