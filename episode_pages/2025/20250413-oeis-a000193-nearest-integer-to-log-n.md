Learn about OEIS A000193 Nearest Integer to Log n

## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. For this deep dive, we're exploring the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS. A really fantastic resource. And we should mention it's kept running by generous support for the OEIS Foundation. Absolutely. Crucial for its upkeep. And especially useful for number theory students, which I know many of our listeners are. Today we're zoning in on one sequence, A000193, the nearest integer to log n. That's right. So for any positive whole number you pick, the sequence tells you which integer is closest to the natural logarithm of that n. So it connects the integers n to this continuous function, the natural log, but in a sort of discrete way. Exactly. By rounding, essentially. Let's look at the first few terms. It starts 0, 1, 1, then 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, then 3, 3. You see these stretches, these plateaus where the number doesn't change. Right. And those plateaus are quite telling, aren't they? What do they tell us? Well, they directly show the slow growth rate of the natural logarithm function. Log n just doesn't increase very fast. Ah, okay. So for several integers in a row, their natural logs are all still closest to the same whole number. Precisely. Like for n, 2, 3, and 4, log n is closer to 1 than it is to 0 or 2, hence the run of ones. Until eventually log n gets big enough to cross the halfway point, say 1.5, and then the nearest integer becomes 2. Exactly. That's when you see the jump in the sequence. It's like rounding to the nearest whole number. Got it. It's a neat visualization. The OEIS page also gives code snippets, Maple, Mathematica, Perri, Haskell. Yeah, and that's really useful. People like PaweÅ‚ Zawsa for Mathematica, Reinhard Zumkeller for Haskell, they've contributed these. Why is having the code there so important? Well, a couple of reasons. First, it makes it practical. You, as a student, can actually compute the sequence yourself, play with it. Right, not just read about it. And second, seeing it implemented in different languages, different paradigms, it sort of underlines the universality of the mathematical idea. Different tools, same result. It bridges computation and theory. And the OEIS is famous for its connections, right? There are cross-references mentioned, like A00195, 01233, and adjacent sequences too. Oh, definitely. Those links are incredibly valuable. They're like pathways to related concepts. So starting points for more digging. Absolutely. You might look at A00195, which is the nearest integer to n times log 2. See how that behaves differently or similarly. It helps build a bigger picture, connects ideas within number theory. It encourages that broader exploration. The entry uses the keywords non, meaning non-negative, and easy. Does easy mean it's trivial? Not necessarily trivial, but maybe fundamental or straightforward to define. Even easy sequences like this can show interesting properties like the log's growth rate we discussed. So don't overlook the simple ones. Never. There's often depth, even in simplicity. That's a key takeaway from the OEIS, I think. And this sequence entry itself, it's authored by Neil Sloan, the founder of OEIS, and was just recently updated. It shows how active this resource is. It's constantly growing, over 382,000 sequences now. It's a living library. So recapping A000193, it categorizes as integers and based on which whole number their natural logarithm is closest to. Creating those characteristic plateaus and jumps that mirror the log function's behavior. And the computational tools and the network of related sequences provide loads of avenues for students to explore further. Definitely. Okay, here's something to think about then. We focused on the natural logarithm base e. How might these patterns, these plateaus and jumps, change if we used a different base? Say log base 2 or maybe log base 10? Hmm, an interesting question. The growth rate would change, so the length of the plateaus would certainly differ. Exploring that could reveal more about how logarithmic scales work in general. Something for our listeners to ponder. Thanks for exploring this sequence with us today.
