## Description

From asteroids to comets to metallic wanderers, small solar system bodies hold clues to how our planetary neighborhood formed. In this episode, we break down what SSSBs are (and aren't), how their compositions and orbits act as time capsules, and what missionsâ€”past, present, and futureâ€”are helping us study them. A curious dive into the cosmic crumbs that shape our solar system.

## Transcript

All righty, one, ready for another deep dive. Today we're going where few have gone before, at least in this show, and tackling these things called small solar system bodies. Yeah, those are pretty cool. Yeah, they're out there all over, actually, but Wikipedia is going to be our map for this journey. Sounds good. So to kick things off, what are we even talking about? Like, when you say small solar system body, what picture should pop into our heads? Okay, well, the official definition, at least according to the International Astronomical Union, is any object, you know, out there orbiting the sun. But here's the catch, it can't be a planet, and it can't be a dwarf planet either. Oh, okay, so like the leftovers, the cosmic crumbs? Yeah, kind of think asteroids, comets, those icy things way out in the Kuiper Belt, all that good stuff. So kind of a miscellaneous category then, everything that didn't make the A-list. Exactly, and you know, it's funny, this whole definition thing, it's pretty new, like 2006 new. Before that, things were a bit, well, a bit messier. Makes sense, I guess. I mean, we're still finding new stuff out there all the time, right? But going back to that definition, it almost sounds like we're saying what an SSSB isn't more than what it is. You're totally right. It's all about exclusion. Like, take moons, for example. Some moons are bigger than some SSSBs, but they're not SSSBs because they orbit planets, not the sun directly. Gotcha, so it's all about who you're loyal to in the cosmic dance, huh? Like the Death Star, if it went rogue and decided to orbit the sun, that'd be an SSSB. Yeah, that's a perfect example. It's that direct connection to the sun that makes all the difference. Okay, so we know what they're not, but is there like a size limit? Is there a point where something's just too small to be an SSSB? Like space dust versus, you know, a small asteroid? That's the million dollar question, and astronomers are still debating it. There's no official minimum size, which makes you think, right? Like, where do we draw the line in this giant universe? Right, it really is mind-blowing when you try to picture. Okay, so let's say we've got our SSSB starter pack ready. Where do we even find these things? Wikipedia mentioned the asteroid belt and the Kuiper Belt. Are those the main hangouts? You got it. The asteroid belt is like this giant ring of, well, asteroid debris hanging out between Mars and Jupiter. Not as crowded as the movies make it seem, though. Right, always dodging asteroids in those movies. And the Kuiper Belt is way out there past Neptune, right? Yeah, super far out. And it's totally different. It's more like a giant donut-shaped region full of icy stuff, like Pluto and Eris live out there. It's crazy to think about all those icy worlds just chilling in the darkness billions of miles away. Oh, and those are just the famous spots. SSSBs are literally everywhere. Near-Earth objects, centaurs, you name it. The solar system is a pretty diverse place. So variety is the spice of space life. Exactly. We're talking tiny petals to almost dwarf planet-sized objects. Some are rocky, some icy, some even have metal. Whoa, metal. Like full-on metal asteroids. Yep, we'll talk about those more later, but they're super interesting. They might even hold clues about how planets form. Okay, color me intrigued. So we've got this incredible variety of objects spread all over the solar system. How do we even begin to make sense of it all? Well, that's where the real detective work starts. We look at what they're made of, how they move, and how they interact. It's like piecing together a giant cosmic puzzle. And believe me, this puzzle has some pretty wild pieces. This is already more exciting than I thought it would be. So what's next? What kind of puzzle pieces are we talking about? Well, let's start with the composition. What these SSSBs are made of tells us a lot about where they came from and how they formed. Like a cosmic fingerprint. Ooh, I like that. So what kind of fingerprints are we seeing out there? Well, for starters, objects farther out tend to have more ice, while those closer in are rockier. It's like a gradient, you know? And then there are the metallic ones, which are a whole other story. Okay, I'm hooked. Let's dive into those fingerprints and see what they reveal about the history of our solar system. Tell me more. All right, back for more on these small solar system bodies. Last time we were talking about how they're like, well, like cosmic fingerprints. Yeah, exactly. And those fingerprints can tell us a whole lot about the history of our solar system. Okay, so spill the tea. What kind of secrets are these fingerprints revealing? Well, one of the coolest things is that they're like time capsules, right? They've been out there orbiting the sun for billions of years, untouched. So they give us this incredible window into what things were like way back when, like when the solar system was just a baby. Wow, so like a cosmic fossil record. That's pretty awesome. Exactly. And by looking at what they're made of, we can learn about the ingredients that went into making everything we see today. Planets, moons, the whole shebang. So like the SSSB recipe book, what kind of recipes are we finding in there? Well, for example, the type and amount of elements in an SSSB can tell us where it was born. You know, what part of the solar system it formed in. Like objects that formed farther out tend to have more ice, while the ones closer in are more rocky. Oh, that makes sense. So their composition is like a birth certificate. Exactly. And by comparing the birth certificates of different SSSBs, we can start to map out the early solar system, see how it all came together. It's like solving a giant jigsaw puzzle. I'm starting to see why you find this so fascinating. So it's not just what they're made of, but where they hang out too, like their cosmic address. Absolutely. Their orbits can tell us a lot about the gravitational forces that have been shaping our solar system over time. Take the asteroid belt, for example. You know, the gaps we see there, they're there because of Jupiter. Jupiter? Really? I mean, it is the biggest planet, but still. Yeah, it's like Jupiter's playing a cosmic game of billiards, clearing out certain lanes in the asteroid belt with its gravity. Whoa, that's kind of scary to think about. But cool. Oh, and comets are another great example. Some of them have these crazy orbits that suggest they were kicked out of their original paths by, like, passing stars or even other giant planets. It's a constant dance out there. Speaking of comets, they're probably the most famous SSB out there, right? I mean, everyone loves a good comet show. For sure. They've been captivating us for centuries, but, you know, they're not just pretty to look at. They're scientifically valuable, too. Really? What makes them so special besides the whole tail thing? Well, unlike asteroids, which are mostly rock and metal, comets are mostly ice and dust. And when they get close to the sun, that ice starts to vaporize, and boom, you get the tail. So it's like a giant cosmic snowball melting as it flies through space. Pretty much. And that tail, it's actually made of pristine material from the early solar system. So by studying it, we can get a glimpse of what things were like billions of years ago. Wow, so comets are like messengers from the past. But how do we even study these things? They're so far away, and they move so fast. Well, luckily, we've got some pretty cool technology these days. We have telescopes that can analyze the light from SSSBs, telling us what they're made of and stuff. And we've sent spacecraft to actually visit them. Oh, yeah, I remember reading about Osiris-Rex, that mission that actually landed on an asteroid and brought back a sample. Yeah, that was a big deal, and it's just the beginning. We're going to see more and more missions like that in the future. We might even start mining asteroids for resources someday. Whoa, now that's some serious science fiction stuff, mining asteroids. Can you imagine? It might sound crazy, but it could happen. I mean, think about it. Some asteroids are full of valuable metals and stuff that's rare on Earth. I guess that makes sense. So what's next on the horizon for SSSB research? What are the big mysteries we're still trying to solve? Oh, there are so many. Like, where did Earth's water come from? Some scientists think it was delivered by comets or asteroids, and then there's the search for organic molecules, the building blocks of life in SSSBs. Okay, now those are some truly mind-blowing questions. So how are we going to find the answers? Well, there are tons of new missions in the works. The European Space Agency is sending a probe to a metallic asteroid called Psyche, which is going to be awesome. And NASA is working on a mission to a Jupiter Trojan asteroid. Plus, we're always getting better at observing them from Earth with telescopes. Sounds like we're on the verge of some major breakthroughs. This is so exciting. I can't wait to see what we learn next. Me too. And who knows, maybe one of our listeners
