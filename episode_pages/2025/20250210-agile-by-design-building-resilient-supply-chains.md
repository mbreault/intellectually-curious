## Description

In this episode of The Deep Dive, we unpack what true agility in supply chains meansâ€”balancing cost, quality, and service even amid volatility. We examine three design archetypesâ€”responsive, efficient, and agileâ€”and dive into real-world examples from IBM, Clorox, Shell, World Kitchen, and more. From demand networks and IBIP to DDMRP and mature SOP practices, learn practical tactics to shrink demand latency, cut inventory, and align planning with strategyâ€”plus pitfalls to avoid.

## Transcript

Welcome back to The Deep Dive. Today, we're going to be looking at building agile supply chains. Yeah. And we've got some research here from Supply Chain Insights, LLC. Excellent. And looks like we're going to be talking about some pretty big names today. We've got IBM, Clorox, Yell. Yeah, this is a topic I'm really excited to talk about. I am too. I am too. You know, only one in three companies right now believe that their supply chains are actually working effectively. Wow. So this is definitely something that needs attention. And, you know, there are some new approaches that I think will really resonate with the listeners today. I hope so. So let's talk about agility. What is it? Is it just being fast? Is it being reactive? Or is there something more to it? Well, it's certainly part of it, right? Being able to react quickly. Yeah. But it's more than that. Agility is really about maintaining cost and quality and customer service, even when demand and supply are volatile. Yeah. So being flexible in the face of uncertainty. Exactly. But still delivering on those promises. Right. And the interesting thing is there isn't one right way to do it. There are different types of supply chain responses, and it's about picking the right design. Okay, so you're saying there are different types of supply chain responses. Yeah. So you've got things like responsive supply chains, which are all about speed and quick reaction times. So think about things like flu vaccines or seasonal items where demand is predictable, but the timing is unpredictable. Yeah, you've got to be able to ramp up production really fast. Exactly. And then you have efficient supply chains, which are really great for managing large volumes and keeping costs down, but maybe not as adaptable. Yeah, that makes sense. If your demand is stable and you have predictable production cycles, and you can focus on efficiency. And then, of course, you have agile supply chains, which are all about performance, even when things are volatile. So new product launches, promotions, custom products, that sort of thing. Makes sense. Yeah, so it's about aligning the right design with the right product flow. Yeah, don't try to manage a responsive product with an efficient supply chain. Exactly. You're going to run into problems. Right, right. So Supply Chain Insights highlighted some tactics for building this agility. Yeah, we'll be getting into that. I definitely want to talk about IBM and their demand networks. It sounds like they had some pretty good results. Really impressive. So they had this problem with excess inventory and price protection in their channel, and they developed this tool called IBIP, the IBM Buy Analysis Tool. So a demand network to get that clear picture of demand. Yeah, it helped them rationalize their inventory and improve their responsiveness to the market. But it wasn't easy. There was some pushback. Well, yeah, I imagine if you've got sales teams who are used to incentivizing distributors to hold a bunch of inventory, it's hard to change that mindset. It is, but they managed to get through it with some policy changes. And interestingly, the 2008 recession actually helped. How so? When the economy tanked, distributors were much more wary of holding all that extra inventory. Suddenly, the risk was a lot more apparent, and the value of that IBIP insight was clear. It became less about pushing product and more about aligning with the real demand. Necessity is the mother of invention, huh? You could say that. The results were great. 50% reduction in inventory, which freed up capital, reduced obsolescence costs. They even improved customer service and gained market share. That's fantastic. Now, Clorox, they used value stream mapping. I'm really curious about their approach. So they were all about aligning their supply chain design with their product lines and their growth strategy. And they used value stream mapping to really get a full view of their operations. So they were trying to visualize that whole supply chain and pinpoint the bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Exactly. And a big part of their success was leadership. James Foster really drove this initiative. So it wasn't just about the tool itself, but the vision behind it. Absolutely. And they did a great job of segmenting their supply chain to match the needs of different products, different markets. That makes sense. Everything's not the same. Exactly. There are trade-offs between cost and speed, and they made deliberate choices. Right, fit for purpose. Exactly. And the results show that they've got this diverse range of products, but they're still competitive. Yeah, that's a great example of tailoring your approach. Now, Shell, their demand-driven transformation, they had a pretty unique set of challenges, I'm guessing. Oh, yeah. The oil and gas industry, super volatile. But it shows that even massive organizations can really embrace these demand-driven principles and see the benefits. What did they do? They moved away from that traditional MRP system and embraced a more holistic approach with things like demand sensing and DDMRP. Can you remind folks what DDMRP is? Yeah, sure. Demand-driven material requirements planning focuses on positioning inventory based on real demand. Right, so having the right inventory in the right place at the right time. Exactly. And this was crucial for Shell because oil prices up and down constantly. And they had this single-instance ERP system that was actually making the bullwhip effect worse. Oh, so the system that was meant to give them that integration and efficiency was actually working against them. Yeah, classic example of how traditional systems can sometimes get in the way. So they needed a more agile approach. They used simulations to really show those benefits. And it was compelling. They saw improvements in their planning, reduced inventory, and they were much more agile even with all that market volatility. So a powerful testament to that demand-driven approach. Definitely. Now, I know we have some other examples. We do. Are there any that stand out? Well, World Kitchen is a great one. They managed finished goods complexity really well. How so? They were very disciplined about product rationalization, and they reduced their poorly performing items by 42%. So really being strategic with that product portfolio. Yeah. Recognizing that too many options can actually slow you down. Yeah. By streamlining, they simplified operations, reduced inventory complexity, and just became more responsive overall. That's great. I feel like we covered a lot of ground in this first part of our deep dive. We did. Of our deep dive. We talked about agility. Yeah. Different supply chain responses and some really fascinating case studies. Yeah, and we just scratched the surface. Oh, yeah. We have a lot more to explore. There are more tactics, more insights, and we'll be getting into all of that in the upcoming parts. Awesome. We'll be back soon to continue our exploration of building those agile supply chains. Looking forward to it. And we'll have even more practical examples and actionable takeaways for you. Absolutely. So stay tuned. Welcome back to our deep dive on agile supply chains. You know, we've talked about some really great case studies. Yeah. IBM, Clorox, Shell, really impressive results. Yeah, and you know, we touched on some other companies too. Yeah. World Kitchen, Rockwell Automation. AGCO. Campbell Soup Company. A lot of different approaches to agility. Yeah, and I want to talk about SOP. Okay. Sales and operations planning. It seems like a big theme in a lot of these success stories. It is. It's really a cornerstone of agility. You know, over 80% of companies already have some kind of SOP process in place. Wow, that's a lot. But it's not just about having it, it's about doing it well. Right. The research actually highlights nine characteristics of a mature SOP process. Okay. And one of the biggest ones is strategy. Makes sense. You got to have a plan. Right. You need to know where you're going. Yeah. SOP should help you get there, translate those goals into something real. So it's about aligning those high-level goals with what's happening on the ground. Exactly. Without that, teams can get lost. Right. Lose sight of the big picture. Yeah. So strategy is key. Okay, so what else makes for a mature SOP process? Balance. Okay. It can't just be about sales or just about operations. Right. It's about finding that middle ground. Meeting customer needs, but also being efficient. That's it. Yeah. And unfortunately, 75% of companies struggle with this. Really? They just can't find that balance. That's a lot of companies. It is. So they're not really getting the full benefit of SOP. No. Interesting. What else is important? Organizational discipline. Okay. Having a clear schedule, roles, responsibilities. That's for sure. Yeah. Consistent outputs. So a process that people can trust and follow. Exactly. Yeah. You need that rhythm, that predictability. Okay, so how do companies actually improve their SOP? We talked about demand networks. Right, like IBM's IBIP. Exactly. They're all about reducing demand latency. Okay, remind me what that is again. So it's the time it takes for information about purchases to flow back up the supply chain. So getting a faster picture of what's happening. Yes, yeah. Instead of relying on old forecasts. Right, like in the past, it was all about orders. Right. But with more products, globalization, micro-segmentation. It gets messy. It does. Things change so fast. Yeah, and that's where demand networks come in. Okay. You're getting data directly from where things are being consumed. Point of sale. Yeah. E-commerce. It's cutting out the middleman. Exactly, yeah. And with that visibility, you can react much faster. Being proactive instead of reactive? Exactly. That's agility. It is. And you know, there are other ways to do
