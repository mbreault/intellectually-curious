## Transcript

Welcome back everyone to our ongoing deep dive into the OEIS. It's that incredible online encyclopedia of integer sequences. It's quite a treasure trove for number theory enthusiasts. Definitely. We're exploring the fascinating patterns and hidden depths these sequences reveal about the world of math. And sometimes they pop up in unexpected places too. Absolutely. And for today's deep dive, we're focusing on A000123. Ah yes, the binary partition function. That's the one. It's got some surprising connections to things you might not expect at first glance. You've got binary numbers of course, but then there's also coin change problems and even hints of computer science lurking in there. Alright, now you've got me intrigued. But before we get ahead of ourselves, let's break down the basics. What exactly are binary partitions? Well imagine you've got an even number, like say 10. Okay, 10 got it. A binary partition is basically a way to write that number as a sum using only powers of 2. So like 8 plus 2. Exactly. Or 4 plus 4 plus 2. Or even 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2. Precisely. And here's the key difference from just the regular binary representation of a number. You can use the same power of 2 multiple times. So we're not limited to just using each power of 2 once. Not at all. And the sequence A000123, the binary partition function, it counts how many different binary partitions you can make for each even number. So for 10, like we were saying, there are actually 10 distinct binary partitions. That's right. 10 ways to build 10 using only powers of 2. That's pretty neat. So what makes this sequence stand out in the world of number theory? What makes it so special? One of the first things that caught mathematicians' attention is the recurrence relation that generates this sequence. It's surprisingly simple. Oh, how so? It goes like this. An equals An-1 plus a floor n 2. On the surface, that does seem pretty straightforward. How would that work in practice though? Let's say we want to find the fifth term in the sequence, A4. We'd need the previous term, A3, and the term at floor 42, which is A2. Add those together and boom, you've got a 4. So each new term is built directly from the ones before it. It's like a domino effect. But there's an interesting twist to this sequence. Oh, what's that? It has this odd-even pattern to it. I'm listening. So apart from the very first term, A0, which is 1, every single term in the sequence is even. Wait, really? Every single term? But we're adding terms together. How does that even work? That's the beauty of it. It was actually first observed by Churchhouse just by looking at the numbers, and then later on, Gupta came along and formally proved it. Interesting. So even with this deceptively simple definition, there are already some surprising properties hiding beneath the surface. Exactly. And it gets even more interesting when we start looking at the generating function for the sequence. It has a really elegant form. Okay, I'm ready to dive into that. What does it look like? It's an infinite product. It goes 1 over 1 minus x times 1 over 1 minus x squared times 1 over 1 minus x to the fourth times 1 over 1 minus x to the eighth, and so on. Each factor represents a power of 2. I have a feeling there's a good reason we're using an infinite product here, especially since we can repeat the same power of 2 in our partitions. You're spot on. Each of these factors makes sure we can use each power of 2 as many times as we need. For instance, that 1 over 1 minus x to the fourth factor, that accounts for all the ways we could include the number 4 in our partitions. I see. So the generating function captures that unlimited use of towers of 2 that's at the heart of binary partitions. Does this connect to other parts of number theory at all? It definitely does. If you're familiar with Euler's work on partitions in general, you'll notice a resemblance. Ah, Euler. What would number theory be without him? Right. This generating function for binary partitions is actually a special case of Euler's more general partition function. We just restrict ourselves to powers of 2, and we get this nice simplified form. It's fascinating how limiting ourselves to powers of 2 leads to such elegant math. But I'm curious, how fast do these binary partition numbers actually grow? That's a great question. And it turns out they grow faster than any polynomial, but slower than any exponential function. So they're kind of in a sweet spot. Not too slow, not too fast. Exactly. And figuring out exactly how they grow led to some significant mathematical work. Ooh, like what? Well, Mahler was one of the first to make some headway. Through his work, he managed to get an early version of the asymptotic formula for the binary partition function. So it seems like different areas of math have contributed to our understanding of this sequence. They really have. And then, in 1948, N.G. de Bruijn came along and published a paper specifically on the growth rate of A000123. He refined that asymptotic description using some really powerful tools. What kind of tools are we talking about here? Things like Tabarian theorems and complex analysis. He used them to analyze that infinite product generating function and came up with a much more detailed description of how the sequence grows. Wow. It's amazing how much depth there is to uncover in this seemingly simple sequence. What other discoveries did mathematicians make? Well, around the 1960s, R.F. Churchhouse made some significant contributions. With the help of the Atlas computer, he was able to populate a huge number of terms in the sequence. And this led him to make a now-famous conjecture about the evenness of the terms. So computers played a role in this discovery. Absolutely. Churchhouse observed that all the terms, except for the very first one, A0, seemed to be even. And later on, Hazraj Gupta formally proved it. That's a great example of how computation and proof can work together to advance math. It really is. But the discoveries didn't stop there. Even the recurrence relation for A000123 has a richer story behind it than you might think. Oh, I'm all ears. Donald Knuth, in his 1966 paper, An Almost Linear Recurrence, explored the recurrence relation for A000123 and connected it to the broader theory of linear recurrences. So even the basic building blocks of this sequence have deeper ties to other areas of math. Exactly. And the story of A000123 is far from over. Mathematicians like Ole Redsted, James Sellers, and even Neil Sloan, the founder of the OEIS, have continued exploring generalizations of binary partitions, and they've been finding all sorts of interesting connections. It's incredible how this seemingly simple concept has led to such a rich and varied history. It really is. And with any good deep dive, we're always left with more questions than answers. That's the beauty of it, isn't it? It is. I mean, if restricting ourselves to powers of 2 leads to such a treasure trove of mathematical insights, what happens if we use other building blocks? What if we use powers of 3 or other number bases? What other hidden gems are waiting to be discovered within the vast world of integer sequences? Those are some fantastic questions to ponder. We've come a long way in this deep dive, from the basic definition of binary partitions to their surprising properties, their unexpected applications, and their rich, interconnected history. It's a testament to the beauty and interconnectedness of math, where simple curiosity can lead to a lifetime of discovery. Exactly. So until our next deep dive into the OEIS, keep exploring, and who knows what mathematical treasures you might unearth. So we've talked about how these binary partition numbers grow faster than polynomials but slower than exponentials. Can you give us a sense of scale for these numbers? Sure. Let's take a look at 100, the 100th term in the sequence. Turns out it's about 35,633, a five-digit number. Okay, that's getting pretty big already, considering we're only at the 100th term. What about the regular partition number for 100, just for comparison? Oh, now that's a completely different piece. The unrestricted partition number, P100, it counts all the ways to break down 100 into positive integers with no restrictions whatsoever. That number is enormous, something like 190,569,292. Whoa, that's a massive difference. Yeah. So even though An grows pretty fast, restricting ourselves to powers of 2 really keeps things from blowing up exponentially. It really does. And as you go to even larger values of N, that difference in growth rates becomes even more dramatic. It's amazing how much of an impact that one restriction has. So where do these binary partition numbers actually show up in the real world? Are there any practical applications? Absolutely. One of the most intuitive ones is the classic coin change problem. Ah, I see where you're going with this. Imagine you have coins in denominations that are all powers of 2. 1, 2 dollars, 4 dollars, 8 dollars, and so on. I'm following. The binary partition function, An, tells us how many different ways we can make change for, say, 10 dollars using only those power of 2 coins. It's the same concept, just applied to a real-world scenario. So if I want to make change for 10 dollars using only those coins. The binary partition function of 5 tells us how many ways to do it. So it's like we're taking that rigid structure of
