## Transcript

Welcome back to the Science Corner here on the Deep Dive. This is our series for, well, anyone who's an intellectually curious amateur scientist. Glad to be here. Today we're diving into something quite fundamental in materials science, the Brunel hardness test. It sounds technical, maybe? A little, perhaps, but the concept is really elegant. We'll be looking at the principles, how it's actually used, you know, its applications, pulling from established standards like ASTM E1015. That's the key reference, yes. Our aim is for everyone listening to get a really solid grasp of this test and why it matters so much. Definitely, it's a cornerstone technique. Okay, so let's start with the basics. What is the Brunel hardness test, fundamentally? At its heart, it's an indentation hardness test. We're essentially finding out useful information about metallic materials, specifically how they resist being permanently dented. By pressing something into them. Exactly. It's a two-step process, fundamentally. First, you press a very hard indenter, typically a tungsten carbide ball, into the surface you're testing. Okay, a hard ball? Any specific type? Tungsten carbide is the standard now. These balls come in specific diameters, 1mm, 2.55, and 10mm are the common ones. Gotcha. You apply a specific force, F, pushing the ball straight down, perpendicular to the surface. Just a quick push? No, and that's important. The force is held steady for a set amount of time, usually about 10 to 15 seconds. We call this the dwell time. Then you remove the force smoothly. Okay, press, hold, remove. That's step one. What's step two? Step two is measuring the result. You're left with a permanent, usually circular indentation on the material. The dent. Right. You need to measure the diameter of this dent very carefully. The standard requires measuring it in at least two directions, perpendicular to each other, say across the circle this way and that way. Right angles? Yes. Then you take the average of those measurements. That gives you the mean indentation diameter, which we usually call D. And that dent tells us the hardness. It's the key input, yes. That odd value, along with the force F and the ball diameter D, goes into a formula to calculate the Brinell hardness number, or HBW. Ah, the formula. How does that look? It looks a bit complicated written out, but the calculation is HBW equals 2 times the force, F. Okay. 2F, divided by the quantity. Yeah. Pi times the ball diameter D times the difference between D and the square root of D squared minus D squared. Wow, okay. So HBW is 2F, D multiplied by D minus the square root of D, D. That's the one. F is the force, usually in kilograms force. D is the ball diameter in millimeters, and D is that mean indentation diameter, also in millimeters. That seems quite precise. It is. And what's really interesting is that this method was developed way back around 1900 by a Swedish engineer, Johan August Brinell. Really? That long ago? Yes. And it was groundbreaking because it became the first widely used standardized hardness test in engineering and metallurgy. A real foundational technique. Incredible. So nearly 125 years old and still fundamental. What about the machine itself? What does the equipment involve? Well, you need a testing machine, obviously. Something sturdy to hold the test piece securely and apply that controlled force through the indenter ball. Stable, I imagine. Absolutely critical. The force application has to be smooth. No rocking, no side-to-side movement, and definitely no impact forces. Just a steady push. And you need something to measure the dent afterwards. Correct. A system for accurately measuring that indentation diameter D. Let's talk about the indenters again. Tungsten carbide balls. You mentioned the sizes. Are there other strict requirements? Oh, yes. They aren't just any spheres. The standard, ASTM E1015, has specific requirements in its Annex A3 regarding the material itself. Things like density, chemical composition. What chemicals? Limits on other carbides, maximum 2%. The amount of cobalt, which acts as a binder, is usually between 5% and 7%, with tungsten carbide making up the rest. It ensures consistency between tests. Makes sense. And perhaps, obviously, but crucial, they must be kept clean. Any oil, grease, dirt, any foreign material can affect the contact and thus the measurement. Right. Even a tiny bit could skew the results. Okay. So we've made the indent carefully. How do we measure it accurately? What devices are used? The standard describes two main types. Type A devices are generally more precise. Think microscopes, often with movable measuring lines or even computerized systems doing image analysis. High-tech? They need high resolution. For example, if you're using the big 10mm ball, the measuring system needs to resolve down to 0.01mm. Wow. And Type B? Type B are simpler. Often handheld microscopes, maybe 20x or 40x magnification, with fixed lines, like a scale etched onto the eyepiece. Like a little ruler in the microscope? Sort of, yes. The graduation spacing is wider than the resolution of Type A. For that same 10mm ball test, the lines might be 0.1mm apart. Still usable, but Type A gives a finer measurement. Okay, so we have the measurement. We calculate HBW. How do we report this? Is it just that HBW is a 250? No, not quite. That number alone doesn't tell the whole story. You need to provide the context. Brinell hardness is reported using different scales. Scales? What defines a scale? A scale is defined by the specific combination of the indenter ball diameter D and the test force F. These combinations are often characterized by something called the force diameter ratio. Force diameter ratio. Yes, it's basically the test force divided by the square of the ball diameter, FDC. The standard lists preferred ratios like 1, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 30. Using a consistent ratio helps compare results. Can you give an example of a specific scale? Sure. A very common one is HBW 103000. Okay, what does that mean? HBW means Brinell hardness with a tungsten carbide ball. 10 means a 10mm diameter ball was used. 3000 means a 3000kg force load was applied. Got it. D is 10, F is 3000. Exactly. And sometimes you'll see the ratio in parentheses like HBW 10300030 because 3000 divided by 10 squared is 30. This scale is typically used for harder metals, say in the range of 95 up to 650 HBW. What about for softer metals? You might use a scale like HBW 10500. Same 10mm ball but only 500kg of force. The ratio here is 5, 5, 10, 30. This is better for materials maybe in the 16 to 109 HBW range. Or a smaller ball. Right. You could have HBW 5750, that's a 5mm ball, 750kg force. The ratio is 30 again. 75 is a 5, equals 75 is a 2, 5 equals 30. Same as the 1 in 3000 scale. So it covers a similar hardness range but uses less force and a smaller indent. So the key takeaway is always report the HBW number along with the test conditions. Absolutely. HBW TF. So HBW 103000 or HBW 5750. And if the dwell time isn't the standard 10-15 seconds you have to report that too, like HBW DFT. Okay. And you mentioned HBW, is there HBS? Yes. HBS was used in older standards when steel balls were more common as indenters. HBW specifically denotes the use of a tungsten carbide ball which is the norm now. Good distinction. So all this effort, this careful measurement, why is it so significant? What does the HBW number tell us practically? It gives us really valuable information about the material's mechanical properties. For one, Brinell hardness often correlates well with the material's tensile strength. Its resistance to being pulled apart? Exactly. And also its resistance to wear and abrasion. Interesting. Why use Brinell over other hardness tests, say Rockwell? Ah, good question. A major advantage of Brinell is the relatively large indentation it makes. This is particularly useful for materials that aren't perfectly uniform on a small scale. Like what kind of materials? Things like cast irons, which could have coarse or mixed microstructures, or certain aluminum alloys. The large Brinell indent averages out these local variations. So it gives a better bulk or average hardness for inhomogeneous stuff? Precisely. Rockwell testing uses a much smaller indenter, so it's faster and great for very hard materials or thin sheets. But on a material with a variable structure, you might get different Rockwell readings depending on exactly where you test. Brinell gives a more representative macro hardness value in those cases. Makes sense. You mentioned the correlation with tensile strength, UTS. Is there a rule of thumb? There is, but use it with caution. It depends heavily on the material type and other factors, like something called Meyers index. But for some steels, a very rough approximation is that the UTS, in KSI, kilopounds per square inch, is about half the Brinell number. So UTS air HBW 2. A rough guide. Useful, but needs care. Okay, performing the tests sound straightforward, but I bet there
