## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. We're continuing our journey through the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, a fantastic resource for anyone really digging into number theory. It really is an indispensable tool. Today we're tackling sequence A000201. It's known as the lower Weishauf sequence. That's right. A sequence with some surprisingly deep connections. So our mission, if you will, is to unpack this sequence, figure out its definition, its properties, and maybe get some of those aha moments when we see where it connects. We've looked at the OEIS entry, BD sequences, Weishauf's game, lots to cover. Indeed. Let's start with the sequence itself. It begins 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19, and so on. Okay, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8. It doesn't immediately look like, say, an arithmetic progression. How do we generate these terms? Well, one of the most elegant ways is through something called BD sequences. BD sequences, right. Remind us what those are. Sure. You take a positive irrational number, let's call it R. Then you look at the sequence formed by taking the floor, the integer part of the multiples of R. So you get floor of R, floor of 2R, floor of 3, and so on. Got it. So if R was pi, you'd get floor pi 3, floor 2pi 6, floor 3pi 9, like that. Exactly. These were studied by Samuel Beattie back in the 1920s, though Lord Rayleigh had noticed something similar even earlier. So how does this connect to A000201, our lower Weishauf sequence? This is where it gets really neat. The lower Weishauf sequence is the BD sequence generated when the irrational number R is the golden ratio, phi. Phi, so approximately 1.618. Precisely. If you calculate floor in phi for n equal 1, 2, 3, and so on, you get 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9. Exactly the lower Weishauf sequence. Huh. The golden ratio, it just keeps showing up everywhere, doesn't it? It certainly does. And it gets better. You mentioned complementary BD sequences earlier. Yeah, what's that about? Okay, so if you have an irrational R greater than 1, you can define another number, S, where S equals R divided by R minus 1. A key thing happens. 1 plus 1 always equals 1. Right. And the BD sequences generated by R and S, let's call them BR and Bs, are complementary. This means they form a partition of the positive integers. A partition. So every positive whole number is in either BR or Bs, but never in both. Exactly that. No gaps, no overlaps. They perfectly divide up all the positive integers. Okay, so if R is phi, the golden ratio, what's the complementary S? Well, if R is phi, then S is phi phi 1. And because of the properties of the golden ratio, this actually simplifies to phi plus 1. Phi plus 1, so about 2.618. That's the one. And the BD sequence generated by this number, floor N phi plus 1, gives you what's called the upper Weishauf sequence. Which starts, let's see, floor phi plus 1 is 2, floor 2 phi plus 1 is 5, floor 3 phi plus 1 is 7. Exactly. 2, 5, 7, 10, 13. That's sequence A0001950 in the OEIS. Together, the lower and upper Weishauf sequences perfectly partition the positive integers. It's really quite beautiful. Wow, okay. That partitioning based on phi is elegant. Now, the OEIS page also gives a direct formula, N plus integers quart 5N 2. How does that work? All right, that's an interesting one. It avoids needing phi directly. The is quart means the integer square root. You just take the whole number part of the square root. This formula pops out from the algebra involving phi. Remember, phi is 1 plus quart 5 2. This formula essentially uses the integer square root of 5N 2 to capture that quart 5 element, but purely with integer operations. So it's computationally maybe more direct if you don't want to deal with irrational numbers. Precisely. The BD sequence definition gives the conceptual underpinning. This formula gives a computational shortcut. Okay. Now, the sources also talk a lot about Weishauf's game. I vaguely remember this. It involves piles of objects. Yes, Weishauf's game. You have two piles of objects, say counters. Players take turns. A player can either take any number of counters from just one pile, or they can take the same number of counters from both piles. Okay. And the winner is? The player who takes the last counter wins. It's a standard impartial game. So where do our sequences come in? Here's the kicker. The pairs of numbers, AN and BN, where AN is the Nth lower Weishauf number and BN is the Nth upper Weishauf number. Those pairs are precisely the losing positions in the game. Losing positions? You mean if it's your turn and the piles are AN, BN, you're guaranteed to lose if the other player plays optimally? Exactly. They're the P positions, the positions from which the previous player can force a win. So if you're faced with piles of size 3, 5, or 8, 13, for example, you know you're in a tough spot. The optimal strategy is completely defined by these two sequences. That's incredible, a direct link between these abstract sequences and a concrete game strategy. It really is. These pairs, AN, BN, are often called Weishauf pairs. They're also used to construct something called the Weishauf array. The Weishauf array. Yeah, it's an infinite grid where the first row is the lower Weishauf sequence, the second row is the upper Weishauf sequence, and the subsequent rows are filled in based on rules related to the game. It shows how fundamental these sequences are to that structure, too. Let's go back to the partitioning idea for a moment. Rayleigh's theorem, or Beattie's theorem, that's the formal statement behind this. That's the one. It guarantees that for any irrational R1, there's this unique S1 with 1R plus 1 equals 1, such that their BD sequences, BR and Bs, partition the positive integers. How is that actually proved? It seems quite non-trivial. There are a couple of nice proofs. One looks closely at the positions of the numbers ANR and Hays on the number line, considering their fractional parts. It shows that for every gap between integers, exactly one term from either BR or Bs must fall into it. Hmm, covering all the integers. Right. Another approach uses contradiction. It assumes there's either an integer missed by both sequences or an integer included in both, and shows this leads to impossible results given the 4N plus 1's equals 1 condition. It's a powerful result, this idea of irrational numbers dictating such a perfect tiling of the integers. It is. And these BD sequences have other interesting properties, too. Such as? Well, for instance, you can tell if a number M is in the sequence BR by looking at its fractional part when divided by R. Specifically, M is in BR if and only if M, which is Mr. minus floor, is greater than 1BR. Okay, a membership test. And there's a formula linking term M back to its index in the sequence. Also, if you look at the sequence of differences between consecutive terms, so floor N plus 1R minus floor N and R, Yeah, what happens there? That sequence of differences forms something called a characteristic Sturmian word. This connects BD sequences to combinatorics on words, which studies patterns in sequences, another whole area. Wow. So these sequences touch on game theory, number theory fundamentals, combinatorics. What about generalizing Rayleigh's theorem? Can you partition integers with, say, three BD sequences? Ah, good question. The theorem itself can be generalized a bit, like to cover positive real numbers or adapted for negative integers. And the Lamberck-Moser theorem offers a broader context for pairs of sequences partitioning the integers. Spensky's theorem proved that you cannot find three or more BD sequences based on irrationals that partition the positive integers in the same way. That perfect partitioning property is specific to pairs related by the 1R plus 1's equals 1 condition. So two is the magic number for BD sequence partitions. Interesting limitation. Now, something else mentioned was residue sequences, looking at Weishauf sequences modulo M. Right. We can ask what happens if we take the terms of, say, the lower Weishauf sequence and look at their remainders when divided by some integer M, like modulo 8. Okay, what does that look like? The example given is 1, 3, 4, 6, 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 0. And it continues. Looking at these sequences of remainders, sometimes they look periodic or at least have strong patterns. Like they repeat after a while? They can seem to. The images provided show plots of these residues mod 8, and they certainly suggest patterns. However, because the underlying generator involves the irrational phi, these
