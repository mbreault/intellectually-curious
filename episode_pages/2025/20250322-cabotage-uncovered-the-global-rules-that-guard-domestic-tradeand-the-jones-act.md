## Description

We break down cabotageâ€”the rules governing domestic transport by ship, aircraft, rail and roadâ€”and why nations insist on control: safety, security, and economic strategy. From the U.S. Jones Act to Indonesiaâ€™s protectionist turn, the Philippinesâ€™ balancing act, and Chinaâ€™s tight controls, we map how different countries approach domestic trade, plus EU and Australiaâ€“New Zealand models. A concise, global look at who really runs the water, air, and rails inside borders.

## Transcript

All right. Welcome to the deep dive, everybody. Ready to jump into something pretty interesting today. Yeah, looking forward to it. Cool. Today, we're going deep on cabotage. Cabotage. You gave us a whole bunch of sources on this, some global stuff, some very U.S.-centric, like one very specific law, the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, or as most people know it, the Jones Act. So we're going to unpack what cabotage even means, because it comes up in all kinds of transportation, ships, planes, even trains and trucks. But then we're going to zero in on the Jones Act here in the U.S. and try to figure out why it's such a big deal and why people have such strong opinions about it. Yeah, it definitely gets people talking. And I think what's interesting about cabotage is that it might seem like a pretty niche topic, kind of obscure, but it actually reveals a lot about how countries approach their economies and their national interests. Like, it goes way beyond just moving stuff around. It's connected to national security, economic development, even how countries deal with each other on the global stage. Okay, so let's break down the word itself. Cabotage. It has a pretty interesting history. It does. It comes from the French word caboter, meaning to travel along the coast. So right away, you see the connection to shipping. Yeah, absolutely. It might be related to Cape, geographically speaking, or maybe even a certain type of boat. But one thing's for sure. What's that? It has nothing to do with the explorer Cabot. Nope, that's a common misconception. Fun fact. But anyway, it started with shipping. That much is clear. But over time, cabotage has expanded to cover a lot more. It has. These days, we're not just talking about ships. It includes aviation, rail, even road transport. Basically, any transportation service that happens entirely within one country's borders. Exactly. Domestic transport, basically. And then there's this whole concept of cabotage rights, which, if I understand correctly, are basically permissions given to a company from one country to do business in another. That's the gist, yeah. And in the world of aviation, these rights, especially the right to fly domestic routes in another country, they tend to be pretty tightly controlled. They do, and it makes sense when you think about it. Most countries want to protect their own airlines. Competition from foreign carriers can be tough to deal with. Yeah, it makes sense. But it's not just about economics either. There are serious national security and safety concerns. When you let foreign airlines operate freely within your borders, you have to ask, who's really in control? Who's making sure everything's up to standard? That's a good point. Although the EU seems to be a big exception to this, right? They are, yeah. EU member states generally give each other these cabotage rights. So you see a lot of airlines operating domestic flights in countries that aren't their home base. Interesting. All right, so let's move from the skies down to the sea, where this whole cabotage idea began, shipping. It seems like most countries with a coastline have some kind of cabotage laws on the books. Oh, yeah, most definitely. And the reasons are often the same as in aviation. Protect domestic industries, make sure they've got enough ships if there's a national emergency, you know, like a crisis where you need your own fleet. Right. And also to keep safety standards high within their own waters. And our sources gave us some really interesting examples of how different countries handle this, like Indonesia. Right. They really shifted toward a more protectionist cabotage policy back in 2005. They did. After a period where foreign vessels had a pretty easy time operating there. So that was a conscious decision to bolster their own shipping industry. It was. And I think it shows how national policies on this can shift, you know, depending on a country's strategic goals and economic priorities at the time. Yeah, totally. Then there's the Philippines. Their cabotage law goes all the way back to 1937. 1937, wow. Yeah, pretty old. Traditionally, it limited domestic trade to ships registered in the Philippines. Which makes sense, right? Protecting your own. Exactly. But then they passed a new law in 2015 which allows foreign vessels carrying exports to stop at multiple ports within the Philippines. So it's like they're trying to find that balance. Right, exactly. Between protecting their local shipping industry and making it easier for international trade to flow. And then there's China. They seem to have a pretty strict system. They do. Any foreign ship wanting to do domestic transport or transshipment in China needs to get permission from their Ministry of Transport first. And it's interesting that Hong Kong and Macau have their own separate rules. With no foreign ships allowed to transport between them and mainland China. Right. And even crossing the Taiwan Strait requires special permits. It shows how sensitive these waterways can be. Absolutely. So Indonesia moving toward protectionism, the Philippines trying to strike a balance, and China holding firm. All different approaches. Yeah. But what ties them together is that they all want to maintain control over their own strategically important waterways. Makes sense. And it's worth noting that the EU actually used to have restrictions on cabotage for newer members like Greece, Spain, and Portugal. They did. But they eventually got rid of them. Seems like they learned over time and moved towards more integration within the bloc. Yeah, I think that's a good point. It's not always a static thing. Policies can change and evolve. Absolutely. And internationally, there are rules like the Hague-Visby rules, but those don't automatically apply to cabotage. Right. Each country gets to decide how they want to handle it. Exactly. It's up to their own national laws. Like in the UK, their Carriage of Goods by Sea Act of 1971 specifically addresses this. It's a lot of variation out there. Okay, now let's talk about the big one here in the US. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, better known as the Jones Act. This law lays down some pretty specific rules for anything shipped by water between US ports. It does. Can you break down exactly what the Jones Act requires? Sure. So basically, any ship carrying goods between US ports has to meet four key requirements. It has to be US-built, US-flagged, US-owned, and crewed by US citizens or permanent residents. Wow, so pretty much all American. Yeah, pretty much. And that US-built part is really specific. It means the major components of the hull, the superstructure, all of that has to be fabricated and assembled right here in the US. So it's not just about slapping it together here. The actual pieces have to be made in America too. Exactly. Even the steel plates, the big structural pieces, all made in the USA. Okay, that makes sense. And this doesn't just apply to the mainland US, right? It covers transport between all points in the US territorial sea, which is that three-mile zone off the coast, as well as internal waters and US territories and possessions. So we're talking places like Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, all that. All of those, yep. It even applies to structures on the outer continental shelf used for oil and gas stuff. Interesting. And there's that other law too, right? The Passenger Vessel Services Act from 1886. Right. Separate law, but similar idea. Basically no foreign ships carrying passengers between US ports. Got it. So Jones Act for goods, Passenger Vessel Services Act for people. But same basic principle. Yeah, same idea. Keep it domestic. Okay, now let's shift back to aviation cabotage for a minute. You mentioned earlier that it's generally less common than in shipping. Why is that? Well, there are a few reasons. For one, the Chicago Convention, which is like the big international agreement on aviation, it actually limits how much countries can grant these exclusive cabotage rights. So that makes it less useful as a bargaining chip in bilateral air agreements. And most open skies agreements, you know, those deals that aim to make international air travel easier, they don't usually include anything about cabotage either. Interesting. But the EU, again, is an exception here. Totally. EU-licensed carriers can pretty much operate domestic routes in any EU country, with some limits, of course. So you see airlines like Ryanair, EasyJet, Vueling, Wizz Air, even Aer Lingus, all flying domestic routes in countries other than where they're based. So they basically created a single aviation market within the EU. Exactly. It's like they treat each other's airlines as domestic for those internal routes. That makes sense. Yeah. And Australia and New Zealand have that interesting agreement too. Through their closer economic relations agreement. Oh, yeah, that's a good one. They allow reciprocal domestic and international flights between the two countries. So you see Jetstar, an Australian airline, flying domestic routes in New Zealand, and Air New Zealand flying a domestic route in Australia. Right. And they also fly a couple of international routes that are kind of unique to that agreement. Like Sydney to Norfolk Island, which is Australian territory, and Sydney to Rarotonga, which is part of the Cook Islands associated with New Zealand. So a carefully balanced system there. Yeah. They've worked out a way to allow some cross-border flights while still maintaining some distinctions, especially when it comes to which airlines can be flag carriers on those international routes. Right. And it's kind of interesting that Australia has a rule where a foreign-owned airline can operate domestically as long as it's incorporated in Australia. They do. But that same airline can't be a flag carrier for Australia on international routes, although their subsidiaries can. It's all very nuanced. It is
