## Description

In this Deep Dive we explore OEIS A000217, the triangular numbers T_n = n(n+1)/2. We trace their roots from the early geometry of the Pythagoreans to Gauss, and survey the many ways they appear in counting, geometry, and algebra. Weâ€™ll highlight core identities like T_n + T_{n+1} = (n+1)^2, plus a suite of combinatorial interpretations (handshakes, domino sets, etc.). Weâ€™ll also peek at generating functions and some deeper connections, including links to even perfect numbers via Mersenne primes.

## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. We're continuing our journey through the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, aimed especially at number theory students. That's right. And today we're tackling a really, I mean, truly foundational sequence. Which one is that? It's OEIS A000217, the triangular numbers. Ah, yes. Classic. You really can't get much more fundamental than the triangular numbers. Well, they're everywhere. Exactly. So let's start with the basics, the definition. The OEIS gives us AN equals N times N plus 1 divided by 2. The sum of the first N integers starting from 1, or 0 if you prefer N0. Right, and it's also the binomial coefficient N plus 1 choose 2. You see that notation? CN plus 1 choose... Sometimes 2. And TN is common as well, T for triangular. Good point. And about that starting point, the OEIS lists the first term as 0 for N0, so 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28. It goes on, of course. Including 0 is sometimes algebraically convenient. You'll make certain formulas cleaner. But often, especially in combinatorics, starting with 1 makes more intuitive sense. The first triangular number is just 1. Yeah, the sum of the first one positive integer. The sequence in the OEIS entry has offset 0, 3, which sort of flags both conventions. Precisely. Now, I think many people's first maybe unconscious encounter with this is the story of Gauss, right? Summing numbers as a kid? Absolutely. Summing 1 to 100. He essentially rediscovered or maybe just intuitively grasped the formula. N-N plus 1, 2. It's a great illustration. It really shows how a potentially long sum collapses into something neat. But the idea is much older, isn't it? Oh, much older. You have to go back to the Pythagoreans. They were fascinated by the lengths between numbers and, well, geometric shapes. Figure numbers. Shapes made of dots or pebbles. Exactly. Arrange dots in layers to form equilateral triangles. One dot on top, then a row of two below it, then three. Ah, okay. So the total number of dots gives you the sequence. 1, 1 plus 2, 3 plus 3 plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is... Precisely. It provides a wonderful visual intuition. That's where the name triangular comes from. You can almost see the formula emerging. And it's great for teaching, too. Maybe using multi-link cubes or something. Definitely. You physically add the next row of N cubes to the previous triangle, TN1, to get TN. It makes the recurrence relation TN plus N really obvious. Okay, so definition, history, visualization. Checked. But the really stunning thing, and this is where the OEIS entry just explodes, is the sheer number of places these numbers appear. It's quite astonishing, isn't it? The diversity of contexts. It really is. Like combinatorial interpretations. The number of edges in a complete graph, N plus 1. Right, a graph with N plus 1 vertices where every vertex is connected to every other one. How does that work out? Well, think about adding the N plus 1 vertex. It has to connect to the N vertices already there. So you add N new edges. So you're adding one edge, then two edges, then three. Adding N edges at the Nth step, it's the sum again. Exactly. The structure grows in the same way the sequence does. Okay, cool. Then there's something about parentheses. Yes, the number of ways to legally insert one pair of parentheses into a string of N letters. Like for ABC, you could have ABC, ABC. That's two ways. Wait, is that right? Let me think. N3, AN is TN. Maybe TN1. Let's check the OEIS note. Ah, string of N letters. For N3, A3 equals 6. That seems too high. Maybe it's a different indexing. The note says TN1. So for N3, T2 equals 3 ways. ABC, ABC. No, just one pair. Okay, let's pause on that exact interpretation. The core idea is it appears in string manipulation too. Fair enough. Sometimes the indexing or exact formulation in these brief OEIS comments needs careful checking. But yes, it shows up there. How about this one? Genus of a non-singular curve of degree N plus 2. That sounds advanced. It is. We're talking algebraic geometry now. The genus is a measure of the topological complexity of a surface, sort of the number of holes. And that's related to TN. For N greater than or equal to 1, yes. TN gives the genus for a curve of degree N plus 2. It's a deep connection between simple counting and complex geometry. Wow. And it's also a bound related to Harnack's theorem on the number of branches of a curve. A N1 plus 1 in that case. Okay, let's reel it back to slightly more tangible things. Perhaps dominoes. The number of tiles in a set of double N dominoes. Think about a standard double 6 set. You have pairs, 0, 0, up to 6, 6. How many unique pairs, allowing repeats like 5, 5, but not caring about order like 1 and 2 versus 2, 1? Hmm. It's like choosing two numbers from 0 N with replacement allowed. Exactly. Which turns out to be equivalent to choosing two distinct numbers from 0 to N plus 1, because N plus 2, choose 2, or TN M plus 1. So for double 6, N6, T7 equals 782 equals 28 tiles. Clever. Okay, another one people might know. Handshakes. Ah, the classic party problem. Yeah. If you have N plus 1 people in a room and everyone shakes everyone else's hand exactly once. The total number of handshakes is TN. The first person shakes N hands, the next new person shakes N1 new hands, and so on. Down to the last person making no new shakes. Sum of 1 to N again. Precisely. It's a great intuitive example. And the list goes on. Permutations, avoiding patterns, ternary words with restrictions, selecting numbers from sets, transpositions in symmetric groups, terms in polynomial expansions, dimension of orthogonal groups, positive roots in root systems, number of triangles formed by civilians. Number of solutions to X plus Y plus Z equals N1 matches in a round-robin tournament. It just keeps appearing. It reflects a fundamental counting principle. Absolutely. Let's switch gears a bit to number theoretic properties. These are often just as fascinating. Agreed. There are some really elegant relationships. Like the conjecture that only 1, 6, and 120 are both triangular numbers and factorials. Right, Brocard's problem in a sense, but for triangular numbers. N mu pm. It's believed those are the only solutions. Shows how different these sequences are, generally. Here's one I love. Add any two consecutive triangular numbers. And you always get a perfect square. Yeah. Tn plus Tn plus 1 is plus 1 plus 2. So 1 plus 3, 4, 22. 3 plus 6, 9, 32. 6 plus 10, 16, 42. It's beautiful. Algebraically, N plus 1, 2 plus N plus 1, N plus 2, 2 simplifies nicely. Visually, you can see two triangles fitting together to make a square. That visual is great. Then there's the link to perfect numbers. An even number is perfect if it equals the sum of its proper divisors. And Tn is an even perfect number if and only if. N is a Mersenne prime. So if 2p1 is prime, then T2p1 is a perfect number. Correct. Like for p3, 23, 1 is a prime. T7 equals 28, which is perfect. 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 7 plus 14 plus 28. For p5, 25, 1 equals 31, prime. T31 equals 496, the next perfect number. That's a really deep connection. What about cubes? I saw something about cubes. Ah, yes. Any perfect cube, N3, is the difference between the squares of two consecutive triangular numbers. How does that work? It's Tn2, Tn1, 2. So T22, T12, 120 minus 23, which is 23. And T32, T22, this is 22232, equals 36 minus 27, which is 33. Wow, that's neat. And the EIS lists many other identities, recurrences. Oh, tons. The basic recurrence TN, TN1 plus N is key. There's also TN, TN1 is 2 plus 1. And properties like TN is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 3, divisibility rules, connections to generating functions. Ordinary generating function is X1 by 3. Exponential generating function involves X. There are Dirichlet series, continued fractions. It's a rich area. It really feels like a sequence you can explore endlessly. And it's also connected to polygonal numbers more generally, right? Yes. Triangular numbers are the simplest case. Three sides, then you have square numbers, four sides, pentagonal, five sides, and so on. They all have related formulas based on adding layers to geometric shapes. Now, something quite interesting I saw mentioned was about sums of consecutive triangular numbers
