## Description

<p>In this Deep Dive, we explore OEIS A000318, the generalized tangent numbers, often denoted d(4,N). The initial termsâ€”4, 128, 16384â€”hint at incredibly rapid growth, and the sequence sits at a rich crossroads of history, combinatorics, and analysis. We'll trace its origins in Sloanâ€™s 1973 handbook and its later entry in the OEIS (1995), and unpack the explicit link to A000182â€”Euler-type numbersâ€”in a precise formula. Weâ€™ll see how these numbers are the coefficients in the Maclaurin expansion of tan(4x), connect that generating function to a continued fraction, and understand how the convergents are PadÃ© approximants to the tan(4x) series, bridging discrete sequences with analytic structure. Finally, weâ€™ll reflect on the OEIS keywordsâ€”nonnegative and easyâ€”and what they reveal about the hidden depth behind a simple integer sequence.</p>

## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. Today we're jumping into the OEIS again, focusing on something especially for you number theory students out there. We're looking at sequence A000318. Ah, yes. A000318. It's known as the generalized tangent numbers D4N. And the first thing you notice, the initial terms are 4, then 128, then a huge jump to 16384. Exactly. That growth is, well, it's incredibly rapid. It makes you immediately ask, you know, what's driving that? What's the underlying math? It really is striking. And this isn't just some obscure sequence, right? It has some history. Oh, absolutely. It was included in N.J.A. Sloan's original A Handbook of Integer Sequences back in 1973. Wow, okay. And then again in Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences in 1995. Its presence there really signals its foundational importance. It's not just a curiosity. So it's recognized as significant. Now, you mentioned a formula connecting it to another sequence. Yes, there's an explicit formula. A and equals 2, 4, N, 2 times A000182. A000182. Those are the generalized Euler numbers or second numbers, right? Precisely. And for you, the student, seeing that formula is a big clue. It hints that maybe there's a combinatorial link, that the things counted by A000182 are related to A000318, just scaled differently. Interesting. So studying one potentially sheds light on the other. Exactly. It reveals a structural relationship, something deeper than just the numbers matching up. Okay, so we've got the rapid growth, the history, this connection via the formula. But what about the name? Generalized tangent numbers. Where does the tangent part come in? Ah, good question. That really gets to the analytical side. Peter Lushney pointed out that these numbers, A and, are coefficients. Coefficients of what? They come from the McLaurin series expansion of the function sec fo x sum 4x. Okay, second times sine. Wait, sec of 4x is 1 cos 4x. So sin 4x, 4x, that's just tan 4x. You got it. It simplifies beautifully to tan 4x. So the sequence terms are literally tied to the series expansion of the tangent function, specifically tan 4x. That makes the name make perfect sense. Yeah. And I also saw a note from Thomas Baruchl about the generating function. Something about continued fractions. Yes, that's another fascinating layer. The generating function for 000318, remember that's the power series whose coefficients are our sequence A and. Right, it sort of encodes the sequence into a function. Exactly. And this particular generating function can be expressed as a continued fraction. That's quite significant. Why is the continued fraction form so important here? Well, continued fractions are a powerful way to represent functions, often revealing deeper structural properties. And even more, the convergence of this specific continued fraction, you know, the rational numbers you get by truncating the fraction. Yeah. They are actually Pade approximants of the McLaurin series. Pade approximants, I've heard the term, but maybe a quick refresher. What's the power of that connection? Sure. Think of Pade approximants as the best possible rational function approximations for a given function near a certain point. They often converge much faster or in wider regions than simple Taylor series truncations. Okay, so they're really good approximations. Extremely good, using rational functions. The fact that the convergence are these Pade approximants links the discrete sequence through its generating function's continued fraction directly to powerful methods in approximation theory and analysis. It bridges the discrete and the continuous. So pulling this all together, sequence A000318, these generalized tangent numbers, they start as simple integers, but they connect outwards. That's the beauty of it. You start with 4, 128, 16384, but you quickly find links to history, to other important sequences like the Euler numbers, to analytical functions like tan 4x, and even to advanced concepts like continued fractions and Pade approximants. It really serves as a bridge between different mathematical ideas. Precisely. And that's the aha moment for you, listening as a number theory student. Seeing how a sequence of whole numbers can encapsulate all this complex structure, generating functions, series expansions, sophisticated approximations, it shows how interconnected math really is. It definitely makes you appreciate what can be hidden inside a simple list of numbers. Which brings us to a final thought. Ah, yes. The OEIS entry keywords, this sequence, A000318, as non, for non-negative, and easy. Easy, yes. After digging into explicit formulas linking sequences, Maclaurin series for trig functions, continued fractions, Pade approximants, what does easy even mean in this context? It's a provocative point, isn't it? It makes you wonder, how many other sequences tagged as easy in the OEIS are hiding just as much depth, just as many surprising connections, waiting for someone like you to explore? Something to think about. That's all the time we have for this deep dive. Thanks for joining us.
