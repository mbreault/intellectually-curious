## Description

Explore A000285, the Fibonacci-like sequence with seeds 1 and 4: A0=1, A1=4, An=An-1+An-2. We'll show how it relates directly to Fibonacci and Lucas numbers (A_n = F_n + L_n + 1, or A_n = 2F_n + F_{n+2}), and why this small seed change creates a distinct, richly connected family. Weâ€™ll highlight striking propertiesâ€”only squares are 1, 4, 9 (and A_{-9}=81 for negative indices), and no term is ever twice a squareâ€”and reveal a combinatorial tiling interpretation and its appearance in the 4-1 Pascal triangle. A fun tour of how tweaking initial conditions opens new mathematical worlds in OEIS.

## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. We're jumping back into the online encyclopedia of integer sequences today. You know, that amazing resource for number patterns. And this one's especially for you number theory students out there. We're looking at sequence A-000285. So what is A-000285? OK, it starts A-0 is 1, A-1 is 4. Pretty simple. Then for N greater than or equal to 2, you just get the next term by adding the previous two, A-N, A-N-1 plus A-N-2. So the first few terms go 1, 4, 5, 9, 14, 23, 37, 60, and so on. OK, let's unpack this. That recurrence relation, A-N, A-N-1 plus A-N-2, that looks really familiar, doesn't it? It absolutely does. It's the Fibonacci recurrence relation. But what's fascinating here really is those starting values, 1 and 4. They make it completely distinct from the standard Fibonacci sequence. Asrathasan back in 78 actually called sequences like this pseudofibonacci numbers. Pseudofibonacci, OK. Exactly, because they use the same rule. But those different starting seeds, 1 and 4, I mean, you get a totally unique sequence. It really stands on its own. Right, so it branches off. Interesting. So digging into it, how does it connect to other big names and sequences? Like, is it related to the actual Fibonacci numbers or maybe Lucas numbers? Oh, definitely. It's deeply connected. You can actually express A-000285 directly using both. For instance, one neat formula is A-N equals Fibonacci-N plus Lucas-N plus 1. Ah, OK, so a direct link. Yes. Or another way to put it is A-N equals 2 times Fibonacci-N plus Fibonacci-N plus 2. It really shows how these sequences, you know, they're all part of this bigger mathematical family. They reflect each other in interesting ways. That makes sense. So beyond just how it relates to others, what about the sequence itself? Does A-000285 have any, well, unique properties that make it stand out? Anything surprising? Oh, absolutely. This is where it gets quite intriguing. Did you know that in the entire sequence, starting from A-0, the only perfect squares are the terms 1, 4, and 9? Wow, just those three. A-1 and A-3. Just those three in the positive sequence. If you look at negative indices, which you can do with this recurrence, A-9 is 81. That's the only other one. OK, so very few squares. Very few. And perhaps even more striking, it's been proven that no term in this sequence, positive or negative index, is ever twice a square. Never twice a square. That seems oddly specific. It is specific. And proving things like that often involves some pretty deep number theory. It tells you something fundamental about the arithmetic nature of A-000285 setting it apart. That's really quite something. Okay, so we have these theoretical properties, these connections, but does this sequence A-000285 ever show up somewhere more tangible, like in combinatorics or geometry? Can we sort of visualize it? We can, actually. There's a wonderful combinatorial interpretation. For n greater than 2, it turns out that A-N plus, well, plus or minus 1, depending on n specifically, plus make it 1 raised to the power of ceiling N-2. Okay. That number counts the ways you can tile a strip of length N-1. But not just any strip 1, with a sort of central staircase pattern, and you're tiling it using just simple unit squares and dominoes. Tiling a staircase strip, that's unexpected. Isn't it? It connects this abstract sequence to a very concrete visual problem. It also pops up as sums along certain diagonals, the SW and E ones, in what's called the 4-1 Pascal triangle. That's another sequence, A-093561. So it has connections to tiling and a variant of Pascal's triangle. Fascinating. It really is amazing how just changing those first two numbers, 1 and 4, takes that familiar Fibonacci rule and creates something with its own unique character, its own mathematical fingerprint, and even these surprising applications. So as you continue exploring number theory, what's the takeaway here? I think the main takeaway is just how sensitive these recurrence relations can be to their initial conditions. A tiny tweak at the start, like using 1 and 4 instead of 0 and 1, unlocks this whole different world of properties and connections. It's a great reminder, really. Keep digging in the OEIS. Keep looking for those variations. You never know what hidden patterns or surprising links you might uncover just by changing one small thing. Keep exploring.
