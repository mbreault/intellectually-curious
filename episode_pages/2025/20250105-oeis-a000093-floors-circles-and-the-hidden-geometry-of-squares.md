## Description

In this episode we dive into A000093, the floor of N^(3/2). We‚Äôll see how this deceptively simple formula links to a web of ideas: the interior lattice points of a circle (A077121 with the ‚Äúminus 1‚Äù adjustment to exclude points on the circumference), the square-root‚Äìbased family that starts with floor(sqrt(N)) (A000196) and extends to floor((sqrt(N))^3), floor((sqrt(N))^5), and beyond, revealing the distribution of squares and the gaps between them. We‚Äôll explore the broader connections to related sequences such as A000578 (counting squares up to n), A074704 (sum of the first n squares), and A0002821 (ways to represent n as a sum of two squares), and discuss how a simple floor operation encodes deep number-theoretic structure and invites questions about higher powers and square-distribution patterns.

## Transcript

Welcome back to the OEIS Deep Dive. As you know, we're exploring these fascinating integer sequences, and today we're looking at one that is A000093. And it starts out with this kind of deceptively simple formula, the floor of N to the power of 3 over 2. Interesting. It's a simple formula, but I have a feeling it's going to lead to some pretty unexpected connections. Yeah, it starts out simple enough, 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, but then it gets a little less predictable. So walk us through this. How does this sequence actually work? Okay, so the floor part of the formula, that means we round each result down to the nearest whole number. So for like the third term, where N is 3, you calculate 3 to the power of 3 over 2, which is like approximately 5.196, and then the floor of that is 5. Got it. So that's the third term in the sequence. Okay, so we're taking each position, you know, raising it to the power of 3 over 2, and then rounding down. Exactly. Now what's really cool is that this sequence is directly connected to another sequence in the OEIS, A077121. Hold on. You're saying there's a connection between rounding down these numbers and another sequence. I'm intrigued. How so? 000093 of N is simply A077121 of N minus 1. Okay, so to understand the first one, we need to figure out the second one. What is that sequence all about? Okay, so that sequence represents the number of lattice points inside a circle with a radius of N. So imagine like graph paper, you know, with points where the lines intersect. Those are your lattice points. And as the circle grows, A077121 counts how many of those points fall within the circle. Okay, so the circle is getting bigger. It's counting up all those points inside. Exactly. Okay. But you said minus 1, so why subtract 1 to get back to our original sequence? What's the significance of that? Well, that makes the connection to the circle even more specific. By subtracting 1, we're basically removing the lattice points that fall exactly on the circle's circumference. Ah, I see. So we're left with only the points inside the circle. So we're not just looking at the whole circle. We're kind of going a layer deeper and looking at just the points inside. Yeah, like zooming in, you know, onto just the points inside. So we've connected our sequence to circles and these lattice points. Yeah. But you mentioned other connections within the OEIS. Yeah. What else is A000093 tied to? Well, one really notable connection is to A000196, which is the integer part of the square root of N. Wait a minute, so we went from circles to square roots. Yeah. How does that even fit into all this? It's all about patterns in the number system. Okay. So A000093, with its use of N to the power of 3 over 2, it's actually part of a broader family of sequences. Okay. And this family is generated by taking the integer part of the square root of N raised to different odd powers. So for A000196, it's N to the power of 1 half. For our sequence, A000093, it's N to the power of 3 halves. Oh, wait. And there are sequences for N to the power of 5 halves, 7 halves, and so on. So we start with that floor of N to the 3 halves. Yeah. But now we're seeing this whole pattern emerge with square roots and their powers. Exactly. This is already a lot more interesting than I thought it would be when we started talking about this sequence. Me too. It's really cool. We've got circles, we've got lattice points, we've got squares. Yeah, it's all connected. Where do we go from here? Well, let's talk about how this family of sequences actually allows us to visualize the distribution of squares within the number system. Okay, I am all ears. Yeah. How does raising the square root of N to different powers help us see the distribution of squares? Let's go back to A000093 and its formula. The floor of N to the power of 3 over 2. Think about what happens as N increases. The values in the sequence, they jump around, right? Yeah. But those jumps actually reflect the growing gaps between consecutive perfect squares. I'm not sure I'm following. Could you maybe give me an example? Sure. Let's take the first few terms of A000093. Okay. We have 0, 1, 2, 5, 8. Right. The difference between the first two terms is 1. Then it's 1 again, then it jumps to 3, and then back to 3. Yeah, I was noticing that in the sequence, those differences seem to oscillate between, you know, like in that case, 1 and 3 is the sequence progressing. Exactly. And those oscillating differences correspond to the gaps between consecutive perfect squares. Okay. So that first difference of 1, that represents the gap between 1, which is 1 squared, and 4, which is 2 squared. Okay. The second difference of 1, that's the gap between 4 and 9, or 3 squared. Right. Then we have a jump to 3, mirroring the gap between 9 and 16, or 4 squared. Okay. So the sequence isn't just generating, you know, random numbers. It's actually mapping out the distances between perfect squares as we move along the number line. Exactly. It's like a hidden code that reveals the underlying structure of squares within the number system. Wow. And this pattern extends to the other sequences in this family, too. Oh, okay. Like if we looked at the sequence generated by n to the power of 5 over 2, we'd see a similar pattern of jumps, reflecting the gaps between consecutive fourth powers. So by exploring these sequences, we're not just, you know, learning about the individual numbers, but we're actually gaining insights into, you know, these broader patterns and relationships that govern how numbers behave. Absolutely. The OEIS is a treasure trove of such insights. Yeah. It allows us to see connections that might otherwise remain hidden and to appreciate the interconnectedness of different mathematical concepts. We've talked about circles, lattice points, the distribution of squares, all stemming from this one sequence. What other insights can we glean from A000093? One thing that stands out to me is how A000093 highlights the power of simple mathematical operations. We're essentially taking a number, raising it to a power, and rounding it down. Yet from these basic operations, we've uncovered a wealth of connections and insights. Yeah. It's a reminder that sometimes the most profound discoveries can emerge from the simplest of concepts. Precisely. It underscores the importance of curiosity and exploration in mathematics. You never know what you might find lurking beneath the surface. Speaking of exploring further, you mentioned other OEIS sequences connected to A000093 earlier. Right. Can we dive into those a little deeper? Of course. We have A000578, which is the number of squares less than or equal to n. So if I understand correctly, for any given number n, this sequence tells us how many perfect squares exist from 1 up to n. That's right. It's a simple concept, but it ties in beautifully with our exploration of squares within the number system. And what about the other sequences you mentioned? We also have A074704, which represents a sum of the first n squares. Interesting. So if the last sequence tells us how many squares there are up to n, this one tells us what they all add up to. I like how these pieces are starting to fit together. Exactly. And then there's A0002821, which delves a bit deeper into number theory. Okay. It represents the number of ways to write n as the sum of two squares. Wow. We're really getting into the nitty-gritty of number theory now. So we're not just looking at individual squares, but also the different ways they can be combined to form other numbers. Precisely. And this connection to A0002821 further reinforces the intricate relationship between A000093 and the fascinating world of squares. Yeah. It's amazing how one seemingly simple sequence can act as a gateway to such a diverse array of mathematical concepts.

We've uncovered a lot about A000093, you know, from its connection to circles and lattice points to it being a part of this family of sequences that reveals the distribution of squares. Yeah. It's amazing how a seemingly simple formula can open up such a rich tapestry of mathematical ideas. What I find most compelling is that A000093 acts as a springboard for further exploration. Oh, really? Okay, in what way? Well, it raises questions that can lead us deeper into the heart of number theory. Like what kind of questions? Well, we've seen how this family of sequences provides insights into the distribution of squares. Right. But what about other powers? Are there similar patterns hidden within the distribution of cubes, fourth powers, or even higher powers? So you're thinking, like, could there be a sequence that maps out the gaps between consecutive cubes? Exactly. Just like A000093 does for squares. Yeah, that's a question worth investigating. And I wouldn't be surprised if the OEIS already has those sequences. Right. Just waiting for someone to discover them and really analyze them. It makes you wonder how many more mathematical secrets are hidden within the OEIS. I know, it's incredible. It's a constantly evolving resource with new sequences being added all the time. So much to explore. And new connections being made. Well, we certainly
