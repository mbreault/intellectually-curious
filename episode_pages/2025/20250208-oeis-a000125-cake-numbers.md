## Description

The cake numbers count the maximum number of pieces a cube can be cut into with N planes. The nth cake number is N^3 + 5N + 6, with alternative expressions that highlight its binomial-coefficient structure and its link to the lazy caterer sequence via consecutive differences. Beyond 3D geometry, A000125 appears in several guisesâ€”from the number of distinct sums obtainable from Â± a sequence of N consecutive integers to the count of maximal cliques in the n+1 triangular graph, all connected back to Pascalâ€™s triangle. Weâ€™ll sketch the intuition behind the 3D cuts, explore the algebraic and combinatorial angles, and glance at the historical threads surrounding this elegant sequence.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into the OEIS. Today, we're slicing into A000125, the cake numbers. I'm already intrigued just by the name. Yeah, it's a sequence that sounds deceptively simple at first, but hides some really elegant mathematics. As number theory students, you might appreciate the way it connects to various concepts you've likely studied. Okay, so let's set the scene. What exactly are cake numbers describing? Imagine you have a cube, like a birthday cake. The cake number for a given N tells you the maximum number of pieces you can divide that cube into by slicing it with N planes. Interesting. So more cuts mean more pieces, but I'm guessing it's not as straightforward as just multiplying, right? Exactly. The relationship is more intricate. If you look at the first few terms, you'll see it's not a simple geometric progression like 1, 2, 4, 8. Instead, it goes 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 26, and so on. That's already hinting at something more complex going on under the hood. Is there a formula that governs this sequence? There is. The formula for the Nth cake number is N3 plus 5N plus 6. Cubic. So that explains why the numbers jump up so quickly as we make more cuts. Each new plane doesn't just divide existing pieces, it creates a whole bunch of new intersections. Precisely. And this is where it gets interesting. This cubic growth actually links the cake numbers to a seemingly unrelated 2D problem, the lazy caterer's sequence. Oh yeah, I remember that one. It's about how many pieces you get when cutting a circle, like a pizza. But how can cutting a cube in 3D be related to cutting a circle? Well, the difference between consecutive cake numbers actually gives you the corresponding term in the lazy caterer's sequence. It's like the jump from one 3D cutting scenario to the next is somehow captured by the 2D circle cutting. That's a pretty wild connection. Is there any intuition behind why that would be the case? Think about it this way. When you add a new plane to the cube, it intersects all the existing planes and lines, creating a bunch of new regions. This process mirrors how adding a new cut to the circle creates new pieces by intersecting existing lines. The difference between consecutive cake numbers essentially captures the extra regions created by that new plane in 3D, which turns out to be analogous to the pieces created by a new cut in 2D. Okay, I think I'm starting to see the link. It's like the 3D complexity is projected onto the 2D plane in a way. Exactly. And this connection to geometry hints at another fascinating aspect of the cake numbers, their relationship to Pascal's triangle. Now that's a name that brings back some fond, or maybe not so fond, memories from combinatorics class. But how does a triangle of numbers relate to slicing a cube? Believe it or not, the nth cake number is also equal to the sum of the first four terms in the nth row of Pascal's triangle. Wow, really? That's a very unexpected bridge between these concepts. Is there a visual way to understand why this connection exists? It's a bit tricky to visualize in its entirety, but think about how Pascal's triangle is built. Each number represents a combination, a way of choosing things. And each new cut in our cube essentially creates new choices for how regions can be formed. So the combinatorial nature of Pascal's triangle somehow reflects the choices created by each new cut in the cube. Exactly. And this geometric link is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hidden depths of the cake numbers. Okay, now I'm really hooked. What other surprises does this sequence have in store for us? Well, let's move away from the geometric interpretations for a moment and delve into a more algebraic perspective. All right, hit me with some algebra. You might be surprised to learn that the cake numbers have a fascinating connection to the world of sine combinations. Sine combinations, as in plus and minus signs. I'm not sure I see the link to our sliced cube. It's one of those connections that makes you appreciate the hidden patterns in math. Olivier Girard, a contributor to the OEIS, observed that the nth cake number represents the maximum number of different sums you can obtain by adding n consecutive positive integers, but with a twist. What's the twist? You're allowed to use any combination of plus and minus signs in front of each integer. So, for example, with n and 3, you could have plus 1, plus 2, plus 3, or minus 1, plus 2, 3, and so on. So the cake number tells you how many unique sums you can create by playing around with the signs of those consecutive numbers. Precisely. It's a bit mind-bending to think that the same sequence that governs cutting a cube also governs this seemingly unrelated sign game. That's incredible. It really highlights how interconnected different branches of mathematics can be. I'm starting to see why mathematicians find sequences like this so fascinating. And just when you thought it couldn't get more intriguing, there's another connection, this time to graph theory. Graph theory. Okay, now you're really testing my number theory comfort zone. Don't worry, we'll keep it accessible. Remember we touched upon the concept of maximal cliques earlier. Vaguely. Remind me what those are again. Of course. Imagine a network of dots connected by lines. This is a graph. A clique is a group of those dots where everyone is friends with everyone else, meaning they're all directly connected. A maximal clique is a clique that can't be made any bigger by adding another friend to the group. Right, I remember that now. So how do these cliques relate to our cake cutting problem? Andrew Howaroyd, another OEIS contributor, pointed out that the nth cake number also corresponds to the number of maximal cliques in a specific type of graph called the n plus 1 triangular graph. Okay, now that's a mouthful. Can we break down what a triangular graph is for those of us not familiar with graph theory jargon? Absolutely. Triangular graphs are named that way because they visually resemble triangles. Their structure is closely related to the triangular numbers, which you might recall are numbers like 1, 3, 6, 10, formed by adding consecutive integers. I see. So the cake numbers not only tell us about slicing cakes and playing with signs, but also about counting special groups of friends in these triangular graphs. Exactly. It's a testament to the underlying elegance and unity of mathematics, how these seemingly different concepts converge on the same sequence. I'm starting to think we should rename this the sequence of surprising connections instead of just cake numbers. Huh, I like that. But speaking of cake numbers, let's not forget the heart of the matter, the formulas that govern this intriguing sequence. Right, we've alluded to some formulas but haven't really dived into them. The most straightforward formula for the nth cake number is n3 plus 5n plus 6. This formula directly calculates the cake number based on its position in the sequence. So if I want to know the 10th cake number, I can just plug in n10 into this formula. Precisely. It's a simple and efficient way to calculate any cake number. That's handy. But knowing there are all these geometric and algebraic connections, I'm wondering if there are other, perhaps more insightful ways to express the formula. You're in luck. There are a couple of other interesting representations that highlight those connections. One involves binomial coefficients. Ah, yes, those combinations we love from combinatorics. How do they fit into the picture? The formula for the cake numbers can also be expressed as an n, n3 plus n2 plus n1 plus n0, where those parentheses denote binomial coefficients. Interesting. So the nth cake number is the sum of four specific binomial coefficients. Exactly. And this formula reinforces the idea that each cake number represents different ways to choose or combine regions created by the cuts. I see. It's like the binomial coefficients are encoding the combinatorial essence of the cake cutting process. Precisely. And there's another formula that beautifully captures the link to the lazy caterer sequence. The one where the difference between cake numbers equals a lazy caterer term. That's the one. We can express it formally as an, an-1, an-1, where ln represents the nth lazy caterer number. It's amazing how a simple difference between consecutive terms can reveal such a deep connection between 2D and 3D cutting scenarios. It speaks to the elegance and interconnectedness of mathematics. But before we move on, I want to emphasize an important point. Go ahead. It's easy to get caught up in the individual formulas and interpretations. But remember, they're all different facets of the same underlying mathematical concept. By understanding these connections, we gain a much richer appreciation for the complexity and beauty of the cake numbers. That's a great point. It's not just about memorizing formulas, but about seeing the bigger picture, the web of relationships that they reveal. Exactly. And with that in mind, perhaps it's time to delve into the history of how this fascinating sequence came to be. Yes, let's trace the origins of the cake numbers and see who are the pioneers who first sliced into this mathematical delight. Unfortunately, the early history is a bit murky. We don't have precise records of when or by whom the cake cutting problem was first investigated. That's understandable. Many mathematical concepts have a long and winding history, often predating written records. However, we do know that the problem of cutting a cube with planes has been around for centuries, likely pondered by mathematicians and geometers throughout history. So it's a classic geometrical problem that eventually found its place in the world of number sequences. Precisely. One of the earliest known discussions of this problem appears in
