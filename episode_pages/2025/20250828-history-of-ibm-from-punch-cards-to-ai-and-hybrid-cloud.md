## Transcript

You know, when you think about the tech world, it changes so fast. So how does a company, any company, manage to stay right at the front? Not just relevant, but actually leading for like over 100 years. I mean, navigating huge tech shifts, market chaos, even wars. It's a tough question. Today, we're going to try and answer that by doing a deep dive into the history of a company that's done just that. International Business Machines, or as pretty much everyone knows it, IBM. Yeah, and our sources for this, they give us this really comprehensive historical picture. It takes us right from the start, you know, when IBM was basically cobbled together from different business machine companies, all the way to today, where they're this tech giant focused on AI and hybrid cloud. Right. So our mission today is to kind of pull apart the big moments, the innovations that maybe surprise you, the big bets they took, and yeah, even the controversies that shaped IBM, and honestly shaped a lot of the tech world we live in now. Hopefully you'll walk away not just knowing more, but maybe with a new appreciation for what it takes to play the long game in tech. And I mean, the long game. Okay, let's dive in. Before we even get to digital computers, I mean, how did a company build its whole foundation on like automating business transactions? It sounds almost basic now. It does sound basic now, but back then it was absolutely cutting edge. So IBM's roots go back to the 1880s, really. But the company we know sort of formally started in 1911. It was called the Computing Tabulating Recording Company, CTR for short. CTR, okay. And it wasn't just one invention. It was actually a merger, an amalgamation of four different companies. You had Bundy Manufacturing. They made time clocks. Herman Hollerith's tabulating machine company. That's a key one. Then the International Time Recording Company, another time clock firm. And the Computing Scale Company of America. So scales, clocks, and tabulators. So Hollerith's part of the tabulating machine company. That was the data processing bit, right? The punch cards? Exactly. Hollerith was the pioneer there. His punch card system, it was famously used for the 1890 US Census, and it was a game changer. Well, the census got done in about six years. Before that, it took nearly a decade. And it saved the government, estimates are around $5 million, which was a fortune back then. And his influence lasted. The 80-column card they introduced later in 1928 became the standard, the IBM card, for something like 70 years. Incredible. That's wild. Okay, then Thomas J. Watson Sr. enters the picture. He comes in around 1914, president by 1915. He really set the course, didn't he? Oh, absolutely. Watson Sr. had a very clear strategy. He wanted this incredibly motivated, well-paid sales force. But here's the key. They weren't just selling machines. They were trained to figure out solutions for customers, customers who often had no idea how to use this newfangled technology. It was very consultative, very customer-focused. And he's the one who gave CTR the name IBM. Yep, that was him. In 1924, they rebranded to International Business Machines. It wasn't just a name change. It signaled, you know, bigger ambitions, global reach, moving beyond just being seen as an office appliance maker. He also built this really unique corporate culture. The Think slogan, everyone knows that. But he did more, especially during the Depression, which seems counterintuitive. It really was visionary for the era. Think started way back in 1915. But he backed it up. He started employee education, the IBM Schoolhouse in 1933, group life insurance in 1934, paid vacations in 1936. During the Depression. During the Depression. While other companies were cutting back, laying people off, Watson was actually hiring more salespeople, more engineers. He was investing, betting on the future. It was a huge gamble, really a bet-the-company moment. That's some serious long-term thinking. But then came this massive government contract, the Social Security Act. That must have been pivotal. Oh, completely pivotal. It was described as the biggest accounting operation of all time. IBM got the contract to maintain employment records for 26 million people. This deal basically propelled IBM's success through the rest of the 30s. Was there any pushback? Like, people worried about one company handling all that sensitive data? You know, not really in a major public way back then. The government needed a solution fast, and IBM had the proven tech. And what's fascinating, connecting the dots here, is how IBM wove everything together right from the start. The tech innovation, the strong culture Watson built, and this focus on huge government clients. It created this incredibly resilient business, even in tough economic times. That Social Security bet paid off massively. But even then, they weren't totally controversy-free. They hit their first antitrust snag pretty early on. That's right. 1936, a consent decree. IBM had to agree to stop forcing customers who leased their tabulating machines to also buy their punch cards. Seems minor, but it basically created a separate market for punch cards. And yeah, it was definitely a sign of the legal battles IBM would face down the road. So they grow domestically, navigate the Depression, and then the world changes dramatically again with World War II. How did that shift IBM's path? Well, like many American companies, IBM shifted heavily to support the U.S. war effort. Their factory started making military gear, Browning automatic rifles, M1 carbines, engine parts. Wow, guns too. Yeah. And they did it with a nominal 1% profit, which they apparently used for funds for families of war casualties. And their main business, the tabulating equipment, that was still crucial. Absolutely critical. IBM machines were doing complex calculations for the Manhattan Project down at Los Alamos. The atomic bomb. Yes. And they also worked with the Navy on the Harvard Mark I, which was this huge early electromechanical calculator. Their tech was deeply embedded in the war effort. But there's also a much darker, more complex side to IBM's wartime story involving their German subsidiary, Dehomag, and Nazi Germany. This requires some careful handling. It absolutely does. It's a deeply troubling chapter. IBM's German subsidiary, Dehomag, which IBM majority owned, supplied Hollerith punch card machines to the Nazi regime. And what were they used for? They were used for various administrative tasks, which included critically organizing census data and identifying populations, including Jewish people. This technology unfortunately aided the regime in carrying out its systematic persecution and ultimately the Holocaust. There was a book about this, right? IBM and the Holocaust. Yes, by Edwin Black. He argued that IBM headquarters in the US maintained significant control and awareness of Dehomag's activities, even continuing business relationships during the war. IBM's stance has generally been that while the subsidiary operated, headquarters lost effective control during the war, and that Black's book didn't reveal new facts beyond what was known about Dehomag's existence and its use by the Nazis. So it's a complex historical debate. It is. It raises profound questions about corporate responsibility, especially when technology developed for neutral purposes like efficiency gets used by oppressive regimes. It forces us to think about complicity versus the realities of operating internationally during wartime. Technical neutrality doesn't mean moral neutrality. It's a crucial point. A very heavy but important part of their history. Okay, moving past the war, there's a leadership change. Thomas J. Watson Jr. takes the helm. Right. Watson Jr. becomes CEO in 1956, though he'd been president since 1952. He really saw the future was in electronic computers, not just the older tabulators, and pushed for a radical reorganization to embrace that. And he also made waves with corporate policy, didn't he? Even before the Civil Rights Act. He did. Way back in 1953, he issued a formal equal opportunity policy letter for IBM. That was a full 11 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law. It was quite progressive for a major corporation at the time. So IBM starts seriously moving into electronic computers. What were the first big steps? They launched the IBM 701 in 1952, their first big commercial electronic computer. Then the IBM 650 followed and became really popular. And a key decision came in 1957. Watson Jr. mandated that all new machines had to use transistors, solid state circuitry, moving away from the less reliable vacuum tubes. That was a big technological leap. And they weren't just building the hardware. They started getting into software and storage, too. That feels very modern. It was the beginning of it all. They worked with the U.S. government on projects like the SAGE air defense system. That work led directly to the SABR airline reservation system. SABR. Okay. Still around today. Exactly. And SABR was significant because it was the first time IBM was really writing software specifically for a customer, not just selling the machines. And then in 1956, a huge innovation, the IBM 350, the world's first magnetic hard disk drive. Suddenly you could store and access large amounts of data efficiently. But the antitrust issues didn't go away. Another consent decree in 56. Yes, another one. This 1956 decree was pretty significant. It forced IBM to actually sell equipment, not just lease it, which had been their dominant model. Wow. Okay. And they also had to license their patents more broadly. This really opened the door for competition companies selling used IBM gear, independent firms offering maintenance, and importantly, plug-compatible manufacturers
