## Transcript

For anyone out there trying to make sense of number theory, the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, it's an incredible tool. Yeah, it's really more than just a catalog of numbers. It's really like a roadmap for mathematical ideas. Right, and you start to see all these connections that are maybe hidden at first. Exactly, exactly. Especially for students, this is like a Rosetta Stone almost for these sequences. And you can see these patterns that seem completely unrelated, but then suddenly you realize they have a common mathematical origin. Yeah, and so that's what we're going to do today, right? We're going to dive into one of these sequences. It's A000188. Okay. And what's really interesting about this one is that it has these multiple definitions, and they all seem kind of different right off the bat. One way to describe it is as the number of solutions to the congruence x squared congruent to zero modulo n. But then you can also say that it's the square root of the largest square that divides n. And then there's this third way, which is the maximum value of the greatest common divisor of d and n divided by d, where d is any divisor of n. And what's so cool is that those three things sound completely different. They do, they do. But they all describe the exact same sequence. And that's the real aha moment here, right? Right. Is that these different ways of thinking about a number, whether it's through this modular arithmetic or its square factors or the relationships between its divisors, they all lead to the same sequence. Yeah, it's all an exact sequence. And it wasn't obvious, you know, it took really sharp mathematicians like Lobos Elmer and Henry Bottomley to actually... To prove it. To prove it, yeah. And it really kind of gets to this really fundamental principle in mathematics, right? That you can have these different perspectives that can all converge on the same truth. Absolutely, it's about connections and seeing how things are related. Yeah, and that's what makes it so exciting, I think. Yeah, yeah. So let's start with the definition that maybe feels the most concrete, right? The square root of the largest square dividing n. Okay. And the OEIS gives some good examples to illustrate this. So for like n equals 8, we see the a of 8 is 2. Right. So why is that? So if we look at the factors of 8, which are 1, 2, 4, and 8, the biggest one, the largest one that's a perfect square is 4. And then the square root of 4, of course, is 2. Right. So that's why a of 8 is 2. Makes sense, okay. Another one is 9, that's equal to 3. Okay. And that one seems even more straightforward. Yeah, 9 itself is already a perfect square. Right. So the largest square dividing 9 is 9, and the square root of 9 is 3. Perfect, okay. So it fits. Now a of 10 is 1. Okay. And this one, you know, when I first saw it, I was like, wait a minute, what's going on here? Yeah, 10 is what we call a square-free number, meaning that the only perfect square that divides it is 1. Right. And of course, the square root of 1 is 1. Is 1. So 10 equals 1. It fits. It fits. And the OEIS makes a point of this, right? Yeah. That for any square-free number, the value of the sequence is going to be 1. Okay. So essentially, it doesn't have an inner square root. Right. That's bigger than 1. Okay, so we have these examples, right? Yeah. But how does that relate to that first definition we talked about, the number of solutions to x squared is congruent to 0 modulo n? Right. I mean, it seems like we're talking about totally different math here, right? Yeah, this is where number theory just kind of shows its beauty. Okay. Let's go back to n equals 8. Okay. Right, so we're trying to figure out how many values of x, when you square them, you get a remainder of 0 when you divide by 8. Yeah. So if you go through all the possible remainders when you divide by 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, you find that, okay, 0 squared, that's 0 modulo 8, and then 4 squared is 16, which is also modulo 8. Right, okay. And no other remainders will work. Right. So you have these two solutions, x equals 0 and x equals 4, modulo 8, and that matches perfectly with what we saw before, where a of 8 was 2. Right. So it's amazing how a question about these solutions to an equation in modular arithmetic is really tied to the square structure of the number 8 itself. It is, yeah. Yeah. Okay, so what about n equals 9, where we had of 9 equals 3 based on that square root definition? Right, so now we're solving x squared is congruent to 0 modulo 9. Okay. So again, we look at those possible remainders when you divide by 9, from 0 up to 8. Okay. And we see that 0 squared is 0, 3 squared is 9, which is also 0 modulo 9, and 6 squared is 36, again, 0 modulo 9. Right. So we have three solutions, 0, 3, and 6 modulo 9. And again, that lines up in the previous definition. It lines up perfectly. Okay, and then finally, n equals 10, where a of 10 was 1. Right, so for n equals 10, we're trying to solve x squared congruent to 0 modulo 10. Okay. And if you check those remainders 0 through 9, you see that only 0 squared is 0 modulo 10. Right. So you only have one solution, x equals 0 modulo 10. And again, that matches consistently with the one. Yeah, it's pretty amazing how these different perspectives all come together. It is, yeah. Okay, so now for that third definition, right? Yeah. Max sub d divides n of gcd of n over d. Okay. And let's break that down a little bit. So we know gcd, that stands for greatest common divisor. Yeah, the biggest number. The largest number. The largest positive integer that divides two or more integers. Right, without a remainder. Without leaving a remainder, exactly. Okay. And in this definition, what we're doing is we're looking at every divisor d of our number n, okay? And for each of those divisors, we calculate the greatest common divisor between that divisor and n divided by that divisor. And then a of n, the value in our sequence, is the biggest of all of those greatest common divisors. Okay, that one sounds like it's a little more involved to actually calculate. Yeah, it's a little more hands-on. So can we do an example, maybe like n equals 12? Sure, yeah. So according to that second definition, the largest square that divides 12 is 4, and the square root of that is 2. Right. So a of 12 should be 2. Yeah. So let's see if this third definition actually gives us the same thing. Okay, yeah, let's try it. Okay, so the divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Right. All right, so let's go through each of those and calculate the gcd of d and 12 over d. Okay. So gcd of 1 and 12 over 1, that's just gcd of 1 and 12, which is 1. Gcd of 2 and 12 over 2, that's gcd of 2 and 6, which is 2. Okay. Gcd of 3 and 12 over 3, that's 3 and 4. Gcd is 1. Yeah. Gcd for 4 and 3, again, 1. Gcd of 6 and 2, that's 2. And finally, gcd of 12 and 1 is 1. Right. So the biggest value we got there was 2, which is exactly what we expected. Exactly. Because a of 12 from the second definition was also 2. Right. It's amazing how they all line up. It is, yeah. It's really quite elegant. It is. So the OEIS mentions that that proof, that equivalence between those definitions 2 and 3, relies on this concept of the square-free part of n. Yeah. Can you explain what that is? Sure. So every integer that's bigger than 1, we can factor it into a product of primes, right? And those primes have exponents. Yeah. And the square-free part of that integer is basically what you get when you just take all the distinct prime factors, but you raise each of them to the power of 1. Okay. You're kind of stripping away any square factors. Right. So for example, 12, right, that's 2 squared times 3 to the 1. Yeah. So the square-free part of 12 would just be 2 times 3, which is 6. Okay. And Elmer's proof is really clever, right? It shows how that maximum gcd of d and n over d, it really isolates that square part of the prime factorization.
