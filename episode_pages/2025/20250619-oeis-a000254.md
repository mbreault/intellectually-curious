Learn about OEIS A000254

## Transcript

Welcome curious minds to another deep dive. Imagine a simple list of numbers. Zero, one, three, eleven, fifty, two seventy-four. It looks innocent enough, doesn't it? But what if I told you these numbers hold the keys to unlocking secrets about how things can be arranged, how polynomials expand, and even how prime numbers behave? That's quite a claim for a list of numbers. It is. Today, our mission is to peel back the layers of OEIS A000254. That's the unsigned sterling numbers of the first kind. Oh, yes. A fascinating sequence. It's from the online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, of course, an incredible resource for anyone who loves patterns in math. And for those of you, you know, delving into number theory, this deep dive, well, it's going to reveal some surprising connections. It's a real pleasure to explore this sequence. It beautifully illustrates the profound interconnectedness of combinatorics, algebra, and even analytic number theory. These numbers, named after James Stirling. Yeah. Though their combinatorial meaning came later. What's truly fascinating is how they just sort of emerge in surprising contexts. They act as fundamental building blocks, whether you're counting arrangements or expanding complex expressions. So we're definitely not just looking at a static list here. Not at all. No, no. We're exploring what these numbers mean, how different mathematical concepts can maybe unexpectedly converge on the very same values. Precisely. And why that convergence is so central to a deeper understanding of mathematical structure. Okay, let's start with the sequence itself then. A000254. It begins 0, 1, 3, 11, 50, 274, and so on. It grows quite rapidly. It certainly does. But what exactly does A-N represent here? The OEIS entry, as it often does, gives us a few definitions, different perspectives really. Indeed, and this sequence is a wonderful example of that. How distinct combinatorial interpretations can lead to the very same numerical values. It highlights this deeper shared mathematical reality. Okay, interpretation one. So the first interpretation for A-N in A000254 is quite direct. It's the number of permutations of N plus 1 elements that contain exactly two disjoint cycles. So this unsigned Stirling number of the first kind, denoted N plus 1, 2, it's fundamentally about counting arrangements. Arrangements of objects into a specific number of cycles. And cycles meaning, remind us quickly. A cycle is like a closed loop of elements transforming into one another. And disjoint just means these loops don't share any elements. Got it. Okay, so if we take A2, 3 from the sequence, we're talking about permutations of three elements, because that's N plus 1 when N is 2. Correct. That have exactly two cycles. Can you give us a concrete example just to visualize it? Certainly. For N2, A2 is indeed 3. We're counting permutations of three elements, let's say 1, 2, 3, that decompose into exactly two cycles. The three possibilities are, first, 1, 23. Here, 1 is a cycle by itself, a fixed point, and 2 and 3 swap places, forming a second cycle. Right, one cycle of length 1, one of length 2. Exactly. Then you have 2, 13, same idea. 2 is fixed, 1 and 3 swap. Okay. And finally, 3, 12. 3 is fixed, 1 and 2 swap. Each of those has exactly two cycles. Makes sense. One singleton, one pair swapping, three ways. Precisely. And if we looked at a 3, following this definition, we'd be counting permutations of four elements with exactly two cycles. That's 4, 2. Okay, that's one perspective. What's the other one? You said there were multiple. Right. Now, for our second interpretation, and this is where it gets intriguing, it yields the exact same sequence for N equals 1. The exact same numbers from a different counting method. Yes. This interpretation is the total number of cycles across all permutations of N elements. Wait, total cycles across all permutations, not just those with two cycles. Correct. You list all possible ways to arrange N items, count the cycles in each arrangement, and then you sum up all those cycle counts. Okay, hold on. That sounds much broader. How can two seemingly different ways of counting end up with the exact same numbers? Let's take a 3 or 11 again. How does that relate to this second idea? It's a great question. It reveals a deep symmetry. So for N3, there are 3 as 6 possible permutations of 3 elements. Let's list them and count their cycles for this second interpretation. Okay, let's do it. First, the identity permutation. 1, 2, 3. That has 3 cycles. 3 cycles. Then the 3 permutations with 2 cycles we just discussed. 1, 23, 12, 3, and 13, 2. Each of these contributes 2 cycles. So that's 3, 2 is 6 cycles from those. Correct. That's 6 cycles. Finally, the 2 permutations with only 1 cycle. 1, 23, and 1, 32. These are the 3 cycles. Each contributes 1 cycle. So 2, 1 equals 2 cycles from those. Exactly. Now sum them up. 3 cycles from the identity plus 6 cycles from the transpositions plus 2 cycles from the 3 cycles. 3 plus 6 plus 2, that's 11. It's 11. It matches a 3 exactly. Wow. It's quite profound that 4, which is permutations of 4 items with 2 cycles, is the same numerical value as the total number of cycles in all permutations of 3 items. The second interpretation corresponds to the sum, sum k1 to nk nk. So whether you're counting permutations of n plus 1 items with exactly 2 cycles or r, you're adding up the total cycles from all permutations of n items. You land on the very same number. That's the idea. That's not just a quirky coincidence. It feels like a profound combinatorial identity. It means if you're solving a counting problem, you might have two quite different ways to frame it. Absolutely. Sometimes one perspective is much easier to work with than the other. This duality gives you powerful equivalent pathways. Amazing. Okay, is there an algebraic view too? There is. This convergence really speaks to the deep underlying structure. Algebraically, these unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind nk are the coefficients you get when you expand the rising factorial. The rising factorial, x to the n rising. Yes, xn, which is xx plus 1, x plus n1. When you expand this into powers of x, think of the rising factorial as foundational in combinatorics, often appearing when counting arrangements where elements are added sequentially. Right, like in polyenumeration or something. It pops up in various places. So, for example, let's take by 3, that's xx plus 1, x plus 2. If you multiply that out, you get by 3 plus 3 by 2 plus 2x. By 3 plus 3 by 2 plus 2x. Coefficients of the Stirling numbers, 3, 3 is 1, the coefficient of by 3, 3, 2 is 3, the coefficient of by 2, and 3, 1 is 2, the coefficient of x. And there it is again, 3, 2 is 3, which matched our a2 value from the start. Exactly. The a sequence we're looking at, a000254, corresponds specifically to the n plus 1, 2 Stirling numbers. This algebraic definition provides a powerful tool for generating and manipulating these numbers, connecting them firmly to polynomial theory. Fascinating. Combinatorics from two angles and algebra too. But how does the sequence grow? How does each term build on the last? That brings us to the recurrence relation, right? Yes, the recurrence. It gives us a rule for generating the sequence. The OEIS entry gives it as a n plus 1, n plus 1, a n plus n. It looks, well, deceptively simple. It does, but it holds a lot of power, and its combinatorial proof is particularly insightful, especially if we use that second interpretation, the total cycles in all permutations one. Okay, walk us through that. How do we get a n plus 1 from a n using that idea? Right. Let's consider how we form the total number of cycles for permutations of n plus 1 elements, starting from the permutations of n elements. There are two distinct ways to incorporate the n plus 1 element. Two ways. First, let's think about the n term in the recurrence. Imagine you have all the n permutations of n elements. You've already counted their total cycles, which is a m. Right. Now introduce the n plus 1 element. One simple way to include it is just let it be its own cycle, a fixed point, a solitary island, completely separate from the other n elements. Okay, like the 1 in a way. Exactly. Since there are n ways to arrange the first n elements, and for each of those we add one new cycle by making n plus 1 a fixed point, this action contributes exactly n new cycles to the total count for n plus 1 elements. Ah, I see. Each of the n permutations gets one extra cycle added to its count when we consider n plus 1, so n cycles added overall. That explains the plus n part. Precisely. Now for the other part of the n plus 1
