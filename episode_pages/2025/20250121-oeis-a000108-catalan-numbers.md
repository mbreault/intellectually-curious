## Transcript

Welcome back everyone to our ongoing deep dive into the OEIS. This time we're going to be looking at a sequence that's particularly interesting, especially if you're a number theory student. Oh yeah? It's 800108, the Catalan numbers. Yeah, the Catalan numbers, those are always a good time. They really are foundational in combinatorics, but their applications go way beyond just that. Yeah, and the OEIS defines them as C of N equals binomial 2N, N, all divided by N plus 1, which also equals 2N factorial over N factorial times N plus 1 factorial. Now this formula, I mean if you've been working with combinatorial problems, you've probably seen this before, right? Absolutely, yeah. If you look at the OEIS entry for A00108, it is incredibly long, which kind of speaks to just how many different ways these numbers can be interpreted and applied. I mean they really do pop up everywhere. They do, and so to kind of get a sense of all these different applications, let's actually look at a few examples from the OEIS entry. Yeah, let's make this a little less abstract and dive into some concrete examples. Okay, so first up, parenthesis matching. Okay. So how many ways can you arrange N pairs of parentheses correctly? Right. Well it turns out the answer is C of N. Exactly. So like if you have three pairs of parentheses, you can actually arrange them in five different ways, so ABCD or like ABCD and so on. Right. And you know as N increases, the number of valid arrangements, it grows and grows. Yeah. And the Catalan numbers really capture that growth perfectly. Absolutely. Okay, so how about another example? Dick paths. Okay. So imagine like a grid, and you can move one unit up or down at a time. So how many paths from 0, 0 to 2N, 0 stay above the x-axis? Right. The answer, again, is C of N. It is, yeah. And it's interesting, there's actually a really cool connection to the parenthesis matching. So if you think about each up step as an open parenthesis, and each step down as a closed parenthesis. Okay. Then every dick path sort of corresponds to like a valid arrangement of these parentheses. So it's like there are two different ways of representing the same thing. Yeah, exactly. They're like two languages expressing the same mathematical idea. And, you know, as a number theory student, that might get you thinking, are there certain groups or transformations, you know, that could be at play here? Okay, let's look at another example. Non-crossing partitions of an N set. So this one's, it's a little more abstract, I guess. Yeah. But imagine like you have N points on a circle, right? Okay. And you want to partition them into subsets. Right. And you do that by like using lines that connect the points. Got it. So a non-crossing partition, that just means none of these lines intersect. Right. And guess what? The number of such partitions. I'm going to guess C of N. C of N. Of course, yeah. Yeah. So how, I mean, how does that even, how does this number pop up in such a, like a visual geometric problem like this? Well, it really highlights how these Catalan numbers sort of unify all these seemingly different combinatorial problems. And the key here is, I think, this recursive structure that they embody. Right. You can kind of break down a valid partition into smaller valid partitions. Right. Just like you can with a balanced set of parentheses. It's a similar idea. Makes sense. All right. One more example. Triangulating polygons. Okay. So this time, imagine a polygon with N plus 2 sides. Right. And you want to divide it into triangles using non-intersecting diagonal. How many ways can you do this? It's got to be C of N. It is. C of N. Yeah. I mean, this connection between like these geometric problems and the Catalan numbers, it's kind of mind-blowing to me. Yeah, it really shows how fundamental these numbers are. Okay. So we've seen just how prevalent these Catalan numbers are. Okay. But let's shift gears a bit. Let's talk about some of their deeper properties. Okay. And, you know, assuming that, you know, our listeners here have some background in number theory, let's go beyond the basics. What do you think? Yeah, absolutely. Let's do that. So let's talk about the recurrence relations of Catalan numbers. So we can actually calculate C of N using previous Catalan numbers. Oh, interesting. So one formula is C of N equals the summation from I equals 1 to N of C of I minus 1 times C of N minus I. So each Catalan number kind of builds upon the ones before it. Exactly. Exactly. It speaks to this inherent recursive nature. Now, how about their asymptotic growth, which is basically how fast they grow as N increases. So they grow approximately as 4 to the N power divided by N to the 32 power times the square root of pi. Wow. And, you know, this should resonate with your understanding of asymptotic behavior from number theory. Yeah, it's amazing how a sequence that comes from such simple counting problems can have this, like, complex growth pattern. Right. All right. Now, what about primality and divisibility? The OEIS entry mentions that only C of 2, which is 2, and C of 3, which is 5, are prime. That's right. Yeah. And there's actually a way to determine the multiplicity of a prime P dividing C of N. Oh. Meaning, like, how many times that prime appears in C of N's prime factorization. Right. And for that, we use the base P representation of N plus 1. Okay. Yeah, that's right. So, for example, if P is 2, the multiplicity is the number of 1s in the binary representation of N plus 1 minus 1. So, like, for C of 7, we look at the binary representation of 8, which is 1,000. There's one 1 in there. So, the multiplicity of 2 in C of 7's prime factorization is 0. Oh, okay. So, it's not divisible by 2. Exactly. That's pretty cool. You know, you have this connection between these counting problems and prime numbers. It just goes to show that even with these, like, well-studied sequences like the Catalan numbers, there's still some hidden depth there. Yeah, definitely. Okay, before we wrap up this part of our deep dive, I want to leave our listeners with something to think about. The OEIS entry mentions the Catalan monoid. Right. So, what is that? And how does abstract algebra connect to these seemingly, you know, pretty simple counting problems? We'll tackle that question in the next part of our deep dive. Sounds good. Yeah. That's a great question, and it really takes us into, like, the world of abstract algebra. And the Catalan monoid, it sounds kind of intimidating, but it's actually this pretty fascinating structure that sort of emerges from these, you know, specific types of transformations. Okay, so before we get into, like, the Catalan monoid itself, can you remind us what a monoid is? You know, some of our listeners might need a little refresher. Yeah, sure. So, in the simplest terms, I guess, a monoid is basically just a set, right, with a binary operation. And this operation, it has to be associative. So, that just means that the grouping of the elements doesn't change the result. And there's also this identity element, which means there's this element that, you know, doesn't change any of the other elements when you combine it with them using the binary operation. Okay, so, like, the integers with addition would form a monoid, right? Exactly, yeah. Because addition is associative, and zero is the identity element. Right. So, now, the Catalan monoid, what this focuses on is transformations that are, well, both order-decreasing and order-preserving. Okay, I think we need to define those terms. Like, what does that mean in this context? Maybe an example would help. Yeah, for sure. So, imagine you've got, like, a list of numbers, right? Okay. And they're in some specific order. So, an order-decreasing transformation would map a number to either itself or a number that, like, comes earlier in the list. So, it can't move the number, you know, further down the list. Got it. And then an order-preserving transformation, well, that basically just means it maintains, like, the relative order of the numbers. So, it's not going to, you know, shuffle the order in some way that, like, messes up the original sequence. Okay, so in the Catalan monoid, you're talking about transformations that have to meet both of these conditions. Exactly. That seems kind of restrictive, I guess. Yeah, it is. It's restrictive, but that's what makes it, you know, interesting. And the cool thing is the number of elements in this Catalan monoid for a set of n elements is, you guessed it, C of n. Oh, wow. Okay, so we've connected these Catalan numbers to parentheses arrangements, paths on a grid, polygon triangulations, and now, like, these abstract algebraic structures like monoids. I know, right? It just shows how, like, fundamental they are. They really weave through all these seemingly different parts of math, and it highlights these deep connections and
