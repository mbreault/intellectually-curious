## Transcript

Welcome back everyone. We're diving back into the world of math today. Oh yeah. And I am super excited about this one. I am too. This is super cavitation. Yeah. Have you heard of this? I have. It's so cool. So we've got some papers, some articles, and we're ready to get into it. Sounds good. So like, are you ready? I am. Yeah. It sounds like it's going to be a, it's going to be a fun one. Like you said, it's ripped from the headlines of, you know. Yeah. Science fiction. Yeah, exactly. So cool. Yeah, it's wild. But let's start, you know, at the beginning. Okay. What is cavitation? Well, cavitation, you know, think of like a fast flowing river. Okay. You see those bubbly swirls around rocks, especially near a waterfall. Yeah. That's cavitation. That's the formation of vapor bubbles in a liquid. Yeah. When the pressure drops below a certain threshold. Oh, so those bubbles are like vaporized water. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But why does that pressure drop? It's all about the relationship between pressure and the liquid's vapor pressure. Okay. So every liquid has a specific vapor pressure at a given temperature. Right. And that's essentially the pressure at which it wants to turn into a gas. Okay. So when the pressure around the liquid drops below that vapor pressure, boom, the liquid vaporizes and forms those bubbles. So the water rushing around those rocks is getting low pressure. Exactly. Yeah. Causing those little bubbles. Yeah. But I've heard those bubbles can be really destructive. They can be. Like they can damage ship propellers and stuff. Yeah, that's right. So how is super cavitation different? So with super cavitation, we're intentionally creating a large, stable cavitation bubble. Okay. That completely envelops an object. Oh, wow. So instead of all those small erratic bubbles, you have one big bubble. Oh, that's cool. That significantly reduces drag. So the object is moving through the water inside a bubble. Yeah, basically. But wouldn't that be like really hard to steer? Absolutely. That's one of the biggest challenges with this technology. Yeah. But before we get into the complexities of control. Okay. Let's first understand how these objects are designed. Okay. To create and maintain that bubble. So the shape's important. Oh, absolutely. The shape is key. Okay. Think sharp edges. Yeah. The noses of these super cavitating objects often look like flat discs or cones. Oh, interesting. Yeah. And this shape is specifically engineered to help form that big bubble. So like torpedoes with like pointy noses. Yes, exactly. Like the Russian VA-111 Shitval torpedo. Okay. It uses rocket propulsion to achieve those initial speeds needed for super cavitation. To get the bubble going. Yeah. And then that specially designed nose helps maintain it. Wow. And how fast are we talking? Oh, these torpedoes can reach some incredible speeds. Yeah. Far exceeding traditional torpedoes. Wow. The Shval, for instance, is reported to reach speeds of over 200 miles per hour. That's insane. Yes. Several times faster than conventional torpedoes. And it's the speed coupled with the reduced drag from that bubble that makes them so effective. Okay. That is so cool. Yeah. I mean, it does sound like science fiction. It really does. But how does the math come into play? Yeah, the math is crucial here. Okay. And that brings us to a key mathematical concept, the cavitation number. Okay. What is that? This number helps us predict whether cavitation will occur. Okay. By taking into account factors like pressure, fluid velocity, and the vapor pressure of the liquid. So it's like a way to quantify the conditions that lead to cavitation. Right. And I imagine it's crucial for designing these super cavitating objects. Oh, absolutely. Understanding and controlling that cavitation number is essential for designing everything. Okay. From the shape of that nose cone to the speed the object needs to travel. Right. To achieve super cavitation. Wow. So the math is at the heart of this. Oh, yeah. But we also have some research papers. Yes. That delves into even more complex mathematical modeling. We do. Of super cavitation. What kind of math? That we're talking about. We're stepping into the realm of advanced fluid dynamics. Oh, wow. Which involves a lot of calculus and differential equations. Cool. One of the key concepts used in these papers is the idea of flow planes. Flow planes. Yeah. So imagine slicing through the water flow around a super cavitating object, creating essentially a two-dimensional cross-section. Okay. That's essentially what a flow plane is. Okay. It allows us to analyze the complex three-dimensional flow in a more manageable way. I see. So by looking at those flow planes, researchers can calculate the forces acting on the object. Precisely. As it moves through the water. Right. These calculations are crucial for understanding things like... Okay. The object's trajectory, its stability. Okay. How it interacts with that cavitation bubble. Wow, so much math. There is. Just to understand the basics. Yeah. And it gets even more complex when you start talking about controlling and maneuvering these objects within their bubbles. Ooh, okay. But that's a topic for our next segment. All right. I am very excited to get into that next time. Yeah, it's going to be good. But for now, we'll take a quick break and come back to explore those fascinating applications of this technology. Sounds good. All right. So we've covered some of the math behind these super cavitating objects. Yeah, I was barely scratched the surface. But I want to talk about the, you know... Of course. Applications of this. We've mentioned torpedoes. Yeah. But where else are we seeing this? Well, you know, as you might imagine, the military applications are pretty significant. Yeah. Given the potential for speed and stealth. Right. Besides torpedoes, there's been a lot of interest in developing super cavitating projectiles. Oh, interesting. Essentially bullets that can travel underwater at incredible speeds. Underwater bullets. Yeah. How do those even work? That's where that super cavitation magic comes in again. Yeah. These projectiles are designed with a sharp nose, similar to the torpedoes we discussed. Okay. And that helps create the cavitation level around the bullet as it's fired. Right. So it's not really traveling through water? No, it's mostly moving through vapor. Oh, okay. Which drastically reduces the drag, allowing it to maintain that velocity over much greater distances. Oh, that's so cool. It is. But I imagine accuracy must be a real challenge with those. Absolutely. That's one of the biggest hurdles researchers are facing. Yeah. It's not easy to maintain stability and trajectory control within that bubble. Right. You can't just rely on traditional rifling techniques or aerodynamic fins. Like a regular bullet. Yeah, exactly. So how do they even control these things? Well, there are a few different approaches being explored. Okay. One method is using a technique called base bleed, where a small amount of gas is released from the rear of the projectile. Okay. This gas helps to stabilize that cavitation bubble. Oh, okay. And can even be used to make slight adjustments to the trajectory. So they're fine-tuning the bubble. Exactly, yeah. That's really cool. It is pretty cool. But let's step away from weaponry for a minute. Okay. Are there applications in other areas? There are. Like, what about transportation? Right. Have we seen that? Yeah. There has been a lot of interest in the transportation side of things. Okay. One of the most ambitious projects was DARPA's Underwater Express program. What was that? They were aiming to develop a high-speed underwater craft that could transport personnel and cargo much faster than current submarines. Okay. How fast are we talking? The goal was to reach speeds of up to 100 knots. Wow. Which is roughly 115 miles per hour. That's insane for underwater. Yeah. It's much faster than most modern submarines. Yeah. What were some of the challenges? Well, as you can imagine, scaling up this super cavitation technology from small projectiles to a large vessel presents a lot of engineering hurdles. Yeah. One of the biggest challenges was creating a cavitation bubble that was large and stable enough to envelop the entire craft. Okay. I can imagine the energy requirements must be enormous. Yeah. It's a significant engineering feat. And then the control, right? Oh, absolutely. Control is a huge issue. Yeah. How do you steer and maneuver something that's essentially gliding through vapor? Yeah, it's wild. Right? So they were exploring different methods, including using strategically placed hydrofoils and control surfaces to try to manipulate the shape and direction of the bubble. Oh, interesting. It's almost like, I guess, surfing a wave. Yeah. But instead of a wave, you're riding a bubble. That's a really good analogy. Yeah. So what happened? Did they ever create a working prototype? Unfortunately, the Underwater Express program was eventually shelved due to some technical challenges and funding constraints. Right. But the research they did during that program really contributed a lot to our understanding of super cavitation and its potential for these large-scale applications. Right. So those high-speed dreams may still be a ways off. Yeah, they might be. But are there any other maybe more practical applications? There are. That are being explored? Yeah. And some of them might surprise you. Okay. Researchers are looking into using super cavitation in the field of medical devices. Medical devices. Yeah. How? Well, one promising area is focused on using micro bubbles and ultrasound to
