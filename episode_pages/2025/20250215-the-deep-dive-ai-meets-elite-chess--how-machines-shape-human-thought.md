Welcome back, everybody, to The Deep Dive. You know, today we're going to dive into a world where human intellect goes head-to-head with artificial intelligence, the world of elite chess. Buckle up, folks, because we're going to explore how AI is not just changing the game, but quite possibly changing how the very best chess players in the world think about the game. Yeah, and you know, it's fascinating because chess has always been kind of a testing ground, hasn't it? Not just for strategic thinking, of course, but as a way for us to understand human cognition and decision making. Oh, absolutely. And for this deep dive, we've got this incredible research article from the British Journal of Psychology. These researchers, they analyzed millions of chess moves to see if AI is actually pushing grandmasters to brand new heights or even fundamentally altering how they approach the game itself. Yeah, and what makes this research so compelling is that we can actually measure this impact objectively. We have the ELO rating system, which gives us a quantifiable measure of a player's skill, and that allows us to track changes in performance over time. So we can take out the guesswork. We can just look at the data. No more subjective opinions, just hard data. But before we jump into the findings, I'm curious about this idea of chess as a laboratory for both psychology and AI. Why is chess such a valuable tool for researchers in both fields? Well, think about it. Chess is this complex game. It requires strategic thinking, pattern recognition, the ability to anticipate your opponent's moves. These are all cognitive skills that psychologists are really interested in. And then on the other side, for AI researchers, chess is a perfect environment to test and develop algorithms that can learn and adapt. So it's almost like this shared space where the human mind and artificial intelligence can kind of spar with each other? Exactly, precisely. And throughout history, chess has been used to explore the nature of human intelligence. We can think of figures like Alfred Benet, Aldrian de Groot, and of course, the Nobel laureate Herbert Simon, all used chess to study how we think and make decisions. So how did the arrival of AI on the scene change this laboratory? We're not just talking about some dusty old chess computer in the corner, are we? No, not at all. The impact of AI on chess has actually come in waves. We can identify two distinct AI revolutions that really shook up the chess world. Two revolutions. Okay, I'm intrigued. Tell me about the first one. So the first revolution hit in the late 1990s. It was really fueled by three things. Powerful personal computers, widespread internet access, and increasingly strong chess engines. So suddenly, players everywhere had access to these incredibly strong digital opponents available 24-7. So it's like having a world champion grandmaster in your pocket, ready to play anytime you want. That's a great analogy. And this access to technology really leveled the playing field. You know, take Magnus Carlsen, for example. Current world champion. He's from Norway. Not historically a chess powerhouse, but his rise to the top really exemplifies how technology broke down barriers. So anyone with a computer and an internet connection could theoretically train at an elite level. That's amazing. But wait a minute. Didn't the Soviets dominate chess for decades? Did they just kind of miss the boat on this whole AI revolution? Well, there's actually research that shows West German players who had earlier access to chess computers improved more rapidly than their Soviet counterparts during this period. So access to technology really did play a key role. So the Soviets with this incredible chess legacy were actually overtaken by players who embraced technology. That's a fascinating twist. But what about the second AI revolution? How did that change things? Well, this is where things get really interesting. The second revolution, which began in the late 2010s, was driven by advancements in deep learning and neural networks. So this new breed of AI wasn't just calculating moves based on brute force. It was learning to play chess in a way that was almost human-like. I've heard about this. Is this where AlphaZero comes in? The AI that learned to play Go at a superhuman level and then turned its attention to chess, just crushing even the strongest engines. That's the one. And you know, Magnus Carlsen himself called AlphaZero his hero. What's remarkable about these new AIs is that they often favor long-term strategic advantages over immediate material gains. They play in a way that's sometimes described as more intuitive, even beautiful. So instead of just, you know, grabbing pieces, they're playing the long game, thinking several moves ahead. That's incredible. But how did these AI revolutions actually affect human players? That's where this research article we mentioned comes in, right? Exactly. This study analyzed over 11.6 million decisions made by top chess players from 1985 to 2021. 11.6 million decisions. Okay, I need to hear more about how they tackled that mountain of data. What did they actually do with all of those chess moves? Well, they compared each move made by these top players to the recommendations of Stockfish, which is considered to be the best chess engine available. This provided an objective measure of decision quality. So they could see how closely the human players aligned with what the AI considered the best move in each situation? Genius. But they didn't just look at any chess players, did they? No, they focused on the elite. They studied the top 20 players overall, the top 20 juniors under 20 years old, and the top 20 senior players over 65. So they could see how players at different stages of their careers, all at the peak of human performance, were impacted by these AI revolutions. Okay, I'm on the edge of my seat here. What did they find? Did the rise of AI lead to a sudden surge in human chess performance? Well, the findings might surprise you. They didn't see those dramatic jumps in performance that you might expect after each AI revolution. Really? No massive leaps forward. That is surprising. So what did they find? What was the impact of AI on these elite players? What's remarkable is that the top players across the board showed consistent improvement over time. It was a steady upward trend, almost mirroring the steady advancement of AI itself. Wait a minute. Are you saying that these elite players were already so good that AI primarily helped them refine their existing skills rather than causing a major shift in how they thought? Like they were already at the top of their game and AI just gave them that extra edge. That's exactly the point. It speaks volumes about the incredible talent and adaptability of these top players. But remember, we also looked at junior and senior players and their stories are a bit different. Okay, I'm definitely sensing some intrigue here. Let's delve into those differences. What happened with the younger generation of players? Did they benefit from AI in a different way? Yeah, the younger players definitely had a different experience. The study found that junior players did show a noticeable improvement in the late 1990s, right when that first AI revolution hit. So access to those early chess engines and online resources really gave them a boost. It's like they grew up with these powerful tools at their fingertips. Exactly. It highlights how crucial access to knowledge and technology is during those formative years. You know, the younger generation embraced these tools and integrated them into their development. Maybe in a way that the more established players didn't. Right. It makes you wonder how different the chess world might look today if those early AI tools hadn't been available. Would we have seen the same kind of rapid rise of young talent? That's a really interesting question. It speaks to the power of technology to accelerate learning and development. But, you know, let's not forget about the senior players. Their story is perhaps the most surprising of all. Okay, you've definitely piqued my curiosity. What happened with the senior players? Did they struggle to keep up in this new AI-driven chess world? Well, surprisingly, the study found that the senior players actually showed the least improvement until the mid-2010s. Wait, so they lagged behind until the second AI revolution, the one with AlphaZero and deep learning? That's unexpected. Any theories on why that might be? It's tough to say for certain, but it could be a data issue. Many senior players didn't play consistently throughout the entire period that was studied, so the data set for them in those early years is smaller and less reliable. Ah, so their improvement might have been happening earlier, but it just wasn't fully captured in the data. That makes sense. But it's still remarkable that they eventually caught up. Oh, absolutely. Their rapid improvement in the mid-2010s is quite significant. So even though they may have been slower to adapt initially, they were still able to learn and evolve their game. It's inspiring to see that kind of resilience and adaptability, even at the highest levels of competition. It really is. And it brings us to the question of AlphaZero's impact. Did this revolutionary AI, with its seemingly intuitive style of play, actually influence human chess at the highest level? Well, Magnus Carlsen had that incredible, record-breaking, unbeaten streak a few years back. I remember some commentators were convinced they saw elements of AlphaZero in his game. Did this research shed any light on that? Well, that's an interesting observation, and some analysts did believe they saw echoes of AlphaZero's influence in Carlsen's play during that streak. Oh, there's always a but. What's the catch? The data shows that Carlsen's objective performance during that streak didn't actually exceed his peak from a few years earlier. So he might have been playing differently, perhaps even more beautifully or creatively, but not necessarily better according to the cold, hard data. Exactly. It seems those new ideas from AlphaZero that focus on long-term positional play might take more time to fully permeate
