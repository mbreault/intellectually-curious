## Transcript

Welcome back everyone to our ongoing deep dive into math. Love it. This time we're tackling something that's maybe a little bit deceptively simple at first, but has kept mathematicians and computer scientists busy for decades. Absolutely. It's the traveling salesman problem. It's a classic. Yeah. And for a reason. It really shows how something that seems pretty straightforward can actually get super complex when you try to scale it up. For sure. I mean we've all encountered this in our lives. Trying to figure out the best way to run errands, plan a road trip, or even the best route for a delivery driver. Totally. And that's what makes it so interesting. It's relatable on some level, but then imagine scaling that up to hundreds or even thousands of cities. Right. The complexity just explodes. Yeah, that's where it gets really interesting. And that's where the fun begins. Okay, so let's get into it for those who might not be familiar. Can you explain what the traveling salesman problem actually is? Yeah, so the traveling salesman problem, or TSP as it's often called, boils down to this. A salesman has to visit a bunch of cities, each city exactly once, and then they gotta come back to where they started. To the starting point. Yeah. And the whole challenge is to find like the shortest possible route. It sounds simple enough when you put it that way. It really does, but here's the thing. Yeah. As the number of cities goes up, the number of possible routes just explodes. It grows like crazy. So it's not even just about finding a route. It's about finding the best one out of a ridiculous number of possibilities. So it's almost like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Yeah. It keeps growing exponentially. Yeah. I'm starting to see why this problem is such a big deal. And here's the other thing to remember. This isn't just some like theoretical brain teaser. Right. The TSP has tons of real world applications. Oh, for sure. Think about optimizing delivery routes for companies like Amazon. Right. Or like figuring out the best way to make a product that has multiple steps in the manufacturing process. Or even something like DNA sequencing. Wow. All of these involve finding the shortest path through a bunch of points. So this has real implications. Real world, yeah. How did people even start thinking about this? So believe it or not, it actually goes back to a game. Wow. Okay. Yeah, back in 1857, an Irish mathematician named William Rowan Hamilton came up with this thing called the Icosian Game. A game. That's not what I was expecting. I know, right? Yeah. So the Icosian Game involved finding a path along the edges of a dodecahedron, which is a 12-sided solid. You got to visit each vertex or corner of it exactly once. So like a three-dimensional connect the dots kind of thing. That's a great way to put it. Yeah. It's a really clever way to visualize and play around with the symmetries of a dodecahedron. Okay, so it was a way to explore mathematical concepts through a game. Exactly. Now, funnily enough, the game itself wasn't a commercial success. Right. But it actually gave us the name. Really? Yeah, it's a traveling salesman problem. Wow. It stuck because of this concept of finding the most efficient path. That's fascinating. So from a 19th century game to modern day logistics, this problem has quite a history. Absolutely. So we know it's complex. How do people actually go about solving it? There's a few different ways people have tried. Okay. Early attempts were really brute force. Okay. You just calculate every single route and compare them. Yeah. Which, as we talked about, gets really impractical as the number of cities grows. It gets too big too fast. Way too fast. So later on, people came up with more sophisticated algorithms like the Health Carth algorithm. Okay. It uses something called dynamic programming to solve it more efficiently. Okay. But even that has limitations as the problem scales up. So even with these really clever algorithms, finding the absolute best solution for large scale problems is still super challenging. It is. And this is where the idea of NP hardness comes in. Okay. The traveling salesman problem is part of a class of problems that are just notoriously difficult to solve perfectly. Right. Especially when things get really big. Okay. I think we need to unpack that a bit. Sure. What does it actually mean for a problem to be NP hard? So NP hardness means there's no known algorithm that can solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time for all situations, especially when you scale it up. Right. So think about it like this. Yeah. Finding the shortest route for five cities. Yeah. Not too bad. Okay. But with 100 cities, even supercomputers would struggle. Oh, wow. It could take years to find the optimal solution. So NP hardness basically means even the best algorithms hit a wall. That's a good way to put it. Yeah. So what do we do then? Do we just give up? Not at all. Okay. Just because we can't find the perfect solution every single time doesn't mean we can't find good solutions. Okay. Mathmenditions and computer scientists are clever. Right. And they found ways around this. Okay. I'm intrigued. What kind of strategies are we talking about? So one approach is to change our focus a little bit. Okay. Instead of trying to find the absolute best solution, which might just take forever, we can look for solutions that are pretty close to the best one. Okay. We call these approximation algorithms. So like saying we might not find the absolute shortest route, but we can find one that's pretty good. Exactly. And we can find it quickly. Exactly. And you know, in a lot of real world situations, that's good enough. Makes sense. Right. Yeah. I'm curious though, are there any specific examples of these approximation algorithms that has really made a difference? Absolutely. One of the most famous ones is the Christofidis-Serdyukov algorithm. Okay. It was developed back in 1976. Okay. And it's still used today. Wow. What's amazing about it is it guarantees to find a solution that's at most one and a half times longer than the absolute shortest path. That's impressive. It is, right. Yeah. So we might not get the perfect solution, but we can get really close. Pretty darn close. And in a lot of situations, that's a win. For sure. Especially if speed is important. Especially if speed is, yeah, if time is of the essence. Exactly. Think about a delivery company trying to route hundreds or even thousands of packages. Oh, yeah. Waiting years for the absolute shortest route is just not going to work. Not practical at all. No. So an approximation algorithm like that can make a huge difference for them. It's mind-blowing to think that these algorithms are probably working behind the scenes in so many parts of our lives. Yeah. From GPS navigation to online shopping. All over the place. The traveling salesman problem is everywhere. It really is. And it shows how something that seems like an abstract math problem can have a real impact on the world around us. This has been really interesting. I'm already starting to see it everywhere. Yeah. But before we go any further, I'm curious, are there different types of traveling salesman problems? You're exactly right. There are a few different variations, which is part of what makes it so intriguing. Okay, tell me more. What are these variations? So one basic difference is between what we call symmetric and asymmetric TSP. Okay. In the symmetric TSP, the distance between two cities is the same in both directions. Okay. Think about driving on a highway. Right. Usually takes the same amount of time to get there and back. That makes sense. So what about asymmetric? So in the asymmetric TSP, distances can be different depending on which way you're going. Okay. Imagine a city with a lot of one-way streets. Right. Going from point A to point B might be longer than going from B to A. Interesting. Okay. Are there other variations? Yeah. There's also what's called the metric TSP. Okay. And in this one, the distances follow what's called the triangle inequality. Uh-huh. Basically, it means that going directly from A to B is never longer than going through some other point C. Gotcha. Like if you're going from your house to the store, it's never going to be faster to go to the library first. That makes sense. Why is this distinction important? So it matters because that triangle inequality assumption lets us use certain algorithms and techniques that wouldn't work otherwise. It kind of simplifies things. So it's like having a set of rules that helps us narrow down the possibilities and find solutions faster. And then there's a specific type of metric TSP called the Euclidean TSP. Okay. And this one distances are just straight lines on a plane. Like imagine plotting cities on a map and measuring with a ruler. Makes sense. That's the Euclidean TSP. So basically a simplified version of the metric TSP. Exactly. It assumes we're working with a flat two-dimensional space. And again, that lets us use more specialized algorithms. This is really fascinating. I'm starting to see how complex and nuanced this problem really is. It is, right. It's so much more than just a simple routing problem. It's a problem that's really pushed the boundaries of math, computer science, and even artificial intelligence. Wow. And that's just the beginning. That's just the start, yeah. Yeah, it really is. It's like a model for all kinds of optimization problems that we see in the real world. It's almost a language of efficiency. And it sounds like that language has led to some pretty big developments. Absolutely. In how we design algorithms. Oh, yeah.
