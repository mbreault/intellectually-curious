## Description

We dive into A000179, the Menage numbers, and how a simple seating puzzle blossoms into a web of combinatorial ideas. From the classic menage problemâ€”alternating men and women around a circle with no spouses adjacentâ€”to rook-theory interpretations on a wraparound board that forbids the main diagonal, the superdiagonal, and wrap-around corners, these numbers count the valid arrangements under tight constraints. We also see them appear in 3Ã—n Latin rectangles where the second row is a cyclic shift of the first. We'll cover how to compute them via Tuchardtâ€™s inclusionâ€“exclusion formula, the recurrence relations that let you build the sequence term-by-term, and the historical threadsâ€”Lucasâ€™s 1891 problem, Tateâ€™s early work, and the broader connections to combinatorics and beyond.

## Transcript

All right, welcome back to the deep dive. We are diving back into the OEIS today, this online encyclopedia of integer sequences. It's been a real treasure trove for us, I think it's safe to say, as we've been exploring it, you know, particularly for folks interested in number theory, and I think even broader than that. Oh, absolutely. I've heard it described as like a Rosetta Stone of mathematics. You start digging into these sequences, and all these surprising connections and really beautiful structures emerge. It's quite remarkable. Yeah, it's really quite fascinating. And so today we're looking at a sequence that's got a particularly interesting history, I think, and it pops up in a lot of different places. And it's OEIS A000179, and these are called the menage numbers. Menage numbers, yeah. So right away, the name itself kind of makes you think about, you know, arrangements and things like that. But let's start, I guess, with the formal definition. Looking at the OEIS here, it says for any integer dollar that's greater than or equal to 2, the not menage number, which is often denoted as a tail, counts the number of permutations of the set, and it gives the set here, 0, 1, and so on, all the way up to monoval. Such that for every index is neither equal to a dollar, nor is it equal to 1 plus dollar when we're considering the indices modulo rattle. So $1 plus dollar would wrap around to 0. Yeah, you're basically saying it can't be in the same position, and it can't be in the next position over, cyclically. Right, exactly. And then we also have these initial values defined, so a0 equals $1, and then a slightly unusual a1 is 101. That he won one. That often throws people for a loop, I think. But it's a great example of how, you know, mathematicians will sometimes kind of stretch their definitions a little bit to make the overall theory more elegant and more consistent. Right. And as you see in the OEIS entry, this value of negative 1, it actually kind of arises naturally when you start thinking about this problem in terms of what's called rook theory. And then it kind of fits perfectly into all these general formulas and recurrence relations that govern these numbers. So it's this convention that might seem a little strange at first, but it's actually incredibly useful. It really is. Okay, so we've got permutations. We've got these sort of specific restrictions on them. Yeah. But then the term menage sort of hints at something a little bit more, I don't know, social, I guess. And this is where this classic menage problem kind of enters the picture, right? Exactly, exactly. So if you take 2 times factorial times $1, what you actually get is the number of ways to seat married couples around a circular table. But with these conditions, right, men and women have to alternate, and nobody can sit next to their spouse. Right. So it's this very kind of concrete problem that leads to this abstract sequence of numbers. You can almost picture the elaborate seating charts and all the kind of awkward encounters you're trying to avoid counting. It sounds like a party planner's logistical nightmare. Exactly. So the OEIS, it notes here that this problem, this menage problem, was formally kind of posed by Edward Lucas in 1891, although it looks like it was considered independently by Peter Guthrie Tate a little bit earlier. Yeah, that happens a lot in math, these kind of parallel discoveries. It's always fascinating to see how different people arrive at the same ideas, often from very different angles. It's really cool. Yeah. And actually, it looks like Tate's work on this problem provides an early and maybe somewhat surprising link to the field of knot theory, which maybe we can touch on a little bit later. But the core of this menage problem, this arranging items, in this case people, around a circle, but with these adjacency restrictions, that's really what these menage numbers are counting. That's the fundamental thing here. Absolutely. That's the heart of it. It's all about constraints and how those constraints affect the number of possible arrangements. So the seating arrangement is a very, I think, intuitive way to understand these numbers. But the OEIS also points to some other maybe less obvious interpretations of these numbers. Yeah, definitely. So there's this, I think, quite elegant connection to the world of non-attacking rooks on a chessboard. So imagine a non-time dollar grid. The menage number actually tells you the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on this special kind of 0-1 matrix. And this matrix, it's got zeros along the main diagonal, so a rook can't be on a square where the row and column numbers are the same. And then also on the super diagonal, which is one step above the main diagonal, and then also in the top right and bottom left corners. So you're essentially creating this kind of forbidden band around the main diagonal, and it wraps around because of this modulo dollar business we talked about earlier with the permutations. Oh, okay. So it's like those restrictions on the permutations. So zero is not equal to any psi, i, and zi not equal to i, i plus one, p mod. That directly translates to these forbidden positions on this rook board. Precisely. It's a perfect correspondence. That's fascinating. That's a really nice connection between these two seemingly different combinatorial problems. Absolutely. It's really beautiful how it all fits together. And the EOES entry actually even gives an example of this restricted matrix structure for, I think, 1 now. Now is 1, 5, 5, just to kind of illustrate how it looks. Yeah, yeah. Highlighting those zero entries. And this connection to rook theory, is it sort of just a visual analogy, or does it lead to some deeper mathematical insights? Oh, no. It's much more than just a visual thing. It's quite powerful, actually. It not only gives you another way to think about and calculate these menage numbers, but it also helps to make sense of that weird Nancy Taller value we talked about earlier. Right. It all kind of clicks into place when you view it through the lens of rook polynomials and the theory of permanents of matrices. And these are some pretty sophisticated tools in combinatorics, so the fact that they naturally accommodate this unusual initial value, it really speaks to the underlying consistency of the mathematical structure here. Okay. And there was another interpretation, I think, that we had mentioned in our overview, and it was talking about a relationship with three times no Latin rectangles, where the second row has a specific structure, a full cycle with a fixed order. Right, right. That one gets a little bit more technical, I guess. But the basic idea is that you're, again, counting ways to arrange symbols in a grid according to certain rules. So in a Latin rectangle, each row and each column has to have distinct symbols, right? So if you impose this extra condition where the second row is a cyclic permutation of the first row, and then you ask, how many ways can you complete the third row so that it also satisfies that Latin rectangle property but avoids certain forbidden positions that are dictated by the first two rows? Right. Well, it turns out that, surprise, surprise, the menage numbers pop up again as the answer. It just highlights how this fundamental counting problem with these constraints appears in all sorts of guises in combinatorial design theory. So we've gone from permutations with these sort of local restrictions to a classic seating arrangement puzzle, and now we've found these numbers in the placement of non-attacking rooks on this special kind of board. And even in this construction of these Latin rectangles, I mean, it really is becoming clear that these menage numbers are kind of this thread that runs through several different areas of combinatorics. It's true. It's like a hidden connection between all these different ideas. It's really remarkable. So, you know, we've talked about these interpretations, but is there, like, a way to directly calculate these numbers? Like, is there a formula for the menage number A dollar? Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. There's this well-known formula. It's called Tuchardt's formula, I think, named after Jacques Tuchardt, who first derived it. And it's expressed as this summation. It involves these alternating signs and binomial coefficients, which is, you know, pretty common when you're using this principle of inclusion-exclusion. It's this really powerful technique for counting things when you have certain properties by, you know, systematically adding and subtracting counts based on these overlapping sets of violations. And so this formula gives you this direct way to compute AN for any value of NIOS. So the OEIS also mentions that these numbers satisfy these what are called recurrence relations? Yeah, recurrence relations. Those are really useful. Yeah, finding a way to define a term in the sequence based on the terms that come before it is a really valuable tool. I mean, both for just, you know, actually calculating the numbers, but also for kind of understanding the underlying, you know, patterns and structures in the sequence. Oh, absolutely. Recurrences give you this sort of, you know, this way to build up the sequence step by step, and it often reveals all sorts of, you know, hidden algebraic properties and connections to things like generating functions. It's pretty neat stuff. So with these menage numbers, are there any known recurrence relations that govern them? Yeah, there are actually several known recurrence relations for the menage number. Some of them are pretty intricate, you know, involving dependencies on, you know, multiple preceding terms. But one particularly interesting one is this four-term linear recurrence. Okay. And, you know, these relationships, they provide these alternative ways to calculate the sequence, and
