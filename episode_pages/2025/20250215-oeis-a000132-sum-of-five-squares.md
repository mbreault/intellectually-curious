Welcome back to The Deep Dive. We've been on this journey exploring the OEIS and all its fascinating sequences. Yeah. It's been pretty fun. Yeah, it has. Today we're going to take a closer look at a sequence that is A000132. Yeah, this one's really cool and it might seem familiar at first glance because it deals with sums of squares. Okay. Specifically, A000132 tells us how many ways we can express an integer as the sum of five squares. Okay, so as number theory students, we've all seen sums of squares. Exactly. But I have a feeling there's more to this sequence than meets the eye. Oh, absolutely. There's always more than meets the eye, right? Right. So why don't we start with a simple example just to kind of illustrate how this sequence works. Okay. Let's take the number four. Okay. You can express it as two squared plus a zero squared plus zero squared plus zero squared. Right. But that's just one representation. Okay. There are actually 80 different ways to write four as the sum of five squares. Wow, 80. That's a lot. I would have thought there would be far fewer. It is a lot, right? It's surprising. And as we go to higher numbers, this sequence gets even more interesting. Okay, so. But before we kind of delve deeper, I want to highlight like a curious pattern in the units digit of the numbers in this sequence. Okay. They always end in either a two or a zero. Hmm, that's interesting. Is there a reason for that? There is. It all comes down to the properties of squares. Okay. When we look at their remainders after dividing by five. Okay. So think about it. The possible remainders when a square is divided by five are only zero, one, and four. Right. Now to get a sum that leaves a remainder of two when divided by five, we need specific combinations of those remainders from our five squares. Okay. And it turns out that only happens when the original number itself is five times a square. Oh, wow. So that simple pattern in the units digit actually tells us something deeper about the structure of the squares and their combinations. Exactly. Okay, well how do we actually calculate these numbers? Well, that's a good question. Like are there formulas? There are. Okay. So generating functions are a really powerful tool in number theory. Okay. And A000132 has a particularly elegant one. Okay. It's sum sum xk2. Whoa. Which may seem a bit intimidating at first glance, but it essentially encodes the entire sequence into a single expression. Okay, so as number theory students, we've seen generating functions. Right. Can you just give me a little idea of how this one works? Absolutely. So imagine expanding this expression. Okay. Each term in the expansion would correspond to a particular way to choose five squares. Right. And the coefficient of that term would tell us how many ways to get a specific sum. Oh, okay. It's like a compact way to represent the entire sequence and analyze its properties. Okay, so it's a way to kind of... Yeah, it's a shorthand. Shorthand, yeah. Exactly. But are there more explicit formulas for this? There are indeed. So Seiichi Maniyama came up with a recursive formula which allows you to calculate terms based on the values of previous terms. Okay. And Daniel Sutil found a formula that directly relates A000132 to A000118. Okay. Which is the sequence for the number of ways to write an integer as the sum of four squares. Oh, okay. So if you know how to calculate the terms of A000118, you can use that to find the terms of A000132. Wow, so we have all these different ways to approach it. Generating functions, recursive formulas, connections to other sequences. Exactly. So A000132, it seems like it's more than just a sequence? Yeah, it's really fascinating. What's truly fascinating is that A000132 isn't just a sequence. It's also the theta series of the lattice Z. Whoa. Okay, hold on. Yeah, so... Theta series and lattices. This connection opens up a whole new world of quadratic forms and modular forms, which are fundamental concepts in number theory. Those sound like pretty advanced topics. They are. Can you kind of break it down for me a little bit? Oh, yeah, absolutely. What is a theta series? So think of a lattice as a regular grid of points in space. Okay. And Z specifically is a five-dimensional lattice. Okay. So the theta series associated with this lattice essentially counts how many lattice points are a certain distance from the origin. Oh, wow. And that's directly related to how many ways we can express a number as the sum of five squares. Okay, so the theta series is like this bridge. It is a bridge. Between the geometry of the lattices and the arithmetic of the sums of squares. Precisely. And that's where quadratic forms come in. Okay. The expression x or a ta plus x or a ta plus x or a ta plus x or a ta that we're dealing with when we talk about sums of five squares is a specific type of quadratic form. Okay. And A000132 tells us how many solutions this equation has for different values of n. Oh, wow. This is starting to paint a much more complex picture than just, like I said, a sequence of numbers. Right. It's beautiful though, right? Yeah. So we're starting to see connections to these, like, really deep mathematical ideas. Lattices, theta series, quadratic forms. And you mentioned modular forms earlier. Right. Modular forms are fascinating. How do those come into play? So modular forms are functions with special symmetry properties that are related to transformations of the complex plane. And it turns out that many theta series, including the one for Z, exhibit these properties, making them a special type of modular form. Oh, so we're connecting A000132 to theta series. Right. Which connects it to modular forms. Exactly. It's a beautiful chain. Yeah, and modular forms, we kind of touched on them earlier, but what's so special about them? Modular forms have deep connections to various areas of mathematics and even physics. Wow. They pop up in number theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and even cryptography. Wow, so they're like... They're everywhere. Yeah, they're all over the place. Exactly. And the fact that A000132 is connected to these objects... Right. It just means that it's a really mathematically rich sequence. It suggests that there might be more to it than we initially thought. It sounds like we've only just scratched the surface of this sequence. I think so. From simple counting to generating functions and now to lattices, theta series, and modular forms. It's amazing how deep you can go. A000132 seems to be a gateway to a whole world of deeper mathematical exploration. Absolutely. And in the next part of our deep dive, we'll delve even deeper into these connections and explore how A000132 relates to other intriguing mathematical concepts. Welcome back to our deep dive into A000132. In the last part, we started uncovering some pretty interesting connections between this sequence and some surprisingly advanced concepts. Yeah, like lattices and theta series. Right, and even modular forms. Oh, those are really cool. Yeah, they are. But we've only just begun to explore this sequence. It's amazing how a sequence that seems to just be about counting the ways to add five squares can lead to all these deeper mathematical concepts. Exactly. It highlights how interconnected math is. Right, and it makes me wonder if there's like a way to visually represent A000132. Oh, that's a great question. Like a graph or something? Yeah, well, visualizing a five-dimensional lattice might be a bit of a stretch. Yeah. But we can definitely represent A000132 graphically because at its core, it is a sequence of numbers. Right. And the OEIS entry actually includes a graph that plots these numbers. Oh, okay. Which allows us to see patterns and trends and stuff. So even though we're dealing with these abstract concepts like lattices and theta series, we can still ground our understanding in something visual. Sometimes those visualizations can help spark new insights. Right. For example, by looking at the graph of A000132, we might notice how quickly the values grow or if there are any like repeating patterns. Okay. And these observations could suggest new relationships or properties to explore. So it's always helpful to combine abstract reasoning with some visual aids. Absolutely. That makes sense. It's a reminder that math isn't just about formulas and equations. Right. It's also about patterns. And relationships, yeah. Now, I'm curious about something you mentioned earlier, modular forms. Yeah. You said that they have these special symmetry properties? They do. Can you kind of elaborate on what those are and why they are important? Yeah. So imagine taking like a geometric shape, like a square, and rotating it or reflecting it. If the shape looks the same after these transformations, we say it has symmetry. Right. Modular forms kind of exhibit a similar kind of symmetry, but in a more abstract mathematical space. Okay. They remain essentially unchanged under certain transformations of the complex plane. So it's a different kind of symmetry. It is. Than what we might normally think about. Yeah. It's a bit more abstract. But how does this connect to A000132? So remember how we talked about theta series and how the one associated with the lattice Z is related to A000132? Yes. It turns out that many theta series, including this one, possess these special symmetry properties, making them a specific type of modular form. Oh, so by connecting A000132 to theta series, we're indirectly linking it to this whole world of modular forms. Precisely. Wow. And their symmetry properties. And modular forms are really important
