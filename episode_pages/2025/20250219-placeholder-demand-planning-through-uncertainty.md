## Description

A deep dive into placeholder demandâ€”how to forecast when you have little to no historical data. We cover methods like analogous analysis, expert panels, the Delphi technique, and targeted market research; discuss risks of misestimation and how to mitigate them with iterative refinement, phased rollouts, and real-time signals; and explore how AI/ML and blockchain boost speed, accuracy, and transparency in early-stage demand planning. Plus a look at future trends shaping agile product launches in volatile markets.

## Transcript

Welcome back. You know, we've covered so much in our series about modern supply chain methods. It's really been a whirlwind. It has, but there's this one concept that seems to pop up all the time. Yeah. Especially when we're talking about unpredictable markets, placeholder demand. Right. You sent over some fascinating research on that. So today we're going to dive into this and see what makes it so crucial. Yeah. You know, it's a real game changer, especially in today's, you know, environment that is so volatile. Imagine for a second you're a supply chain professional and you're about to launch a new product. Could be a gadget, could be a new fashion line. You're excited. Right. But there's a problem. You don't have any historical sales data to really base your forecasts on. How do you plan for production or inventory? Yeah, that's something I think a lot of our listeners can relate to. So how does placeholder demand sort of bridge that gap? So it acts as like an initial estimate, a stand in, you could say, until more concrete data becomes available. So think of it as like a temporary scaffold to let you start building your supply chain strategy, even when you're working with incomplete information. So instead of waiting for concrete numbers that could take months, placeholder demand lets you kind of hit the ground running. Exactly. And it's not just about getting a head start. It's about this proactive approach. Right. It's about agility and supply chain management. And so it allows for early planning. Okay. And it helps you gain visibility into the potential demand that's out there. Okay. And it just makes your operations more adaptable. Yeah, in today's environment, that's got to be incredibly valuable. Absolutely. But how do supply chain professionals even develop these placeholder figures? It seems like a tricky process when you have such limited data. Yeah, it's a little bit of art and a little bit of science. Okay. Let's break it down a little. One common approach is what's called analogous analysis. So for example, you're launching a new line of plant-based protein bars. You might analyze the sales of similar products in the health food market. I see. Like an organic snack bar or a vegan protein powder. So you're looking for clues in the market for products with similar target audiences. Yeah. Adjusting for the unique features. Precisely. Finding those relevant data points. Right. And then extrapolating to your situation. Okay, interesting. Are there other techniques that supply chain professionals can use to create these figures? Absolutely. Qualitative forecasting methods can be invaluable, like expert panels. Okay. Where you gather insights from veterans in the industry. Also Delphi technique. Okay. Which involves structured questionnaires and getting feedback from experts. And market research plays a role too. Definitely. Surveys, focus groups. All about gathering as much information as possible. Right, from different sources. From diverse sources. Okay. As much as you can. This sounds like a really collaborative process. It is. Involving different departments and stakeholders. It has to be. You need marketing and sales and finance, even suppliers. Wow. To create a comprehensive demand picture. So even with all these methods though, isn't there a risk of inaccuracies in the placeholder demand? Because we are dealing with estimations? You're right. And what if those estimations are way off? That's a concern. And that's something we should talk about. Overestimating could lead to excess inventory and storage costs. Underestimating could lead to stock outs, lost sales, frustrated customers. So it's a balancing act. It is. You need to be prepared, but avoid costly mistakes. So what are some of the strategies that companies can use to kind of mitigate those risks and refine those placeholder estimates? Well, one of the most effective mitigation strategies, I think, is to have an iterative approach. Okay. So you don't treat the placeholder demand as a static figure. You're constantly refining it as new information comes in. Right. So you monitor early sales data, pre-orders, keep an eye on social media, and even analyze traffic patterns on your website. It's almost like a feedback loop. It is. Built into your demand planning. Yeah. You start with the educated guess, but then you continuously refine it based on real-world signals. Exactly. And the beauty of it is it allows you to be more agile in responding to market shifts. Right. So if you see indicators that demand might be higher than you anticipated, Right. you can adjust procurement orders, ramp up production, or even tweak your marketing campaign. That makes a lot of sense. So using real-time data to validate those initial assumptions. Right. Make course corrections as needed. Absolutely. And speaking of course corrections, another mitigation strategy I like is the phased rollout approach. Okay. Especially for new product launches, instead of going all in with a massive global launch, Right. you could start with a smaller targeted release, a specific region or market segment. That seems like a prudent strategy when there is a lot of uncertainty. It is. You could gather early data and kind of test those placeholder estimates in a controlled environment. Precisely. And then use that feedback to refine your production plans, adjust inventory, and even tweak your marketing messaging. It's a much more data-driven approach. Absolutely. To managing a product lifecycle. And I imagine technology plays a role in all this as well. It does. We're seeing a convergence of AI and machine learning with placeholder demand forecasting. Wow. And these algorithms can analyze vast data sets, identify complex patterns, and even learn from past successes and failures. So it's not just about human intuition anymore. Right. It's about augmenting that expertise. It's about augmenting it with the power of data analytics. That's a key point. And these AI-driven systems can take into account so many more variables than a human can. Absolutely. They could factor in everything. They can from seasonal trends, economic indicators, even social media sentiment. Wow. Competitive activity. So these technologies are transforming placeholder demand from an educated guess to a much more sophisticated forecasting tool. They are. And it's not just about improving accuracy. It's also about speed. Right. AI algorithms can process data and generate insights so much faster. Right. Which allows supply chain professionals to make decisions quicker. It's really fascinating. We've talked about blockchain technology a lot in our episodes and the impact it's having. Right. Does blockchain have a role to play in this? It does. Blockchain can enhance the reliability and transparency by creating a tamper-proof record of all the data sources and assumptions that are used. So you're creating a trusted ecosystem where everyone from suppliers to retailers has access to the same verified information. Precisely. And that level of transparency is so valuable, especially when you're working with multiple partners across a complex supply chain. Sure. Because it builds trust, it minimizes disputes. Right. And it makes sure everyone's operating from the same set of facts. That's really insightful. It seems like placeholder demand forecasting is really becoming a much more sophisticated process thanks to these emerging technologies. Absolutely. And as these technologies continue to evolve, we can expect even greater accuracy, agility, and transparency in how companies manage demand in those very early stages of a product's lifecycle. So fascinating. This has been a great deep dive into the world of placeholder demand. But before we wrap things up, I'd like to get your take on one more thing. What does the future hold for this concept? Any emerging trends that you're particularly excited about?
