Learn about OEIS A000118

## Transcript

Welcome back to The Deep Dive. We're continuing our journey through the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, and this time we're focusing on a sequence that should be particularly interesting to you as a number theory student. Oh, definitely. It's S000118. Ah, yes. S000118. This sequence dives into a really classic problem in number theory, figuring out how many ways you can represent any given number as the sum of four squares. And it seems like such a simple question at first glance. Yeah. But I have a feeling it's going to unravel into something a lot more complex. You are absolutely correct about that. Now, the OEIS, it labels A000118 as a few things, non, nice, and easy. Right. So non meaning non-negative. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. I'm guessing that means it's mathematically interesting and then easy meaning it's relatively straightforward to define. Exactly. But even with that easy label, I suspect there's a lot more to it than meets the eye. Yeah, you're absolutely right. And it's important to remember that the OEIS, you know, they standardized their sequences to keep everything consistent. So they typically drop those leading zeros and ones and they don't really pay attention to signs. Right, right. This is really helpful when you're comparing and analyzing different sequences, you know, making sure everything's on the same page. But underneath that standardized presentation, there's often a whole lot more mathematical depth hiding. So just to be clear, A000118, it's counting the ways to express any non-negative integer as the sum of four squares. And we're including zero and we're including using negative integers within those squares. Exactly. Yes. So let's look at some examples. Like the number zero, there's really only one way to represent that, right? Zero squared plus zero squared plus zero squared plus zero squared. Right. But if you take the number one, now we have eight different representations because each of those four squares could be either positive one or negative one. Right. Okay, I see how that works. Yeah. And the OEIS entry, it actually lists the first 60 terms of the sequence, which gives us a little bit of a peek into those patterns. But what I'm really curious about is the historical context of this. Did the study of A000118, did it all begin with the OEIS or does it have deeper roots going back further? Well, it definitely goes way back, long before the OEIS was even a glimmer in someone's eye. I figured. Back in 1917, the incredible mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, he was already deep into this problem exploring these fascinating things called theta functions and how they connect to sums of squares. Theta functions, that sounds pretty complex. It can be. Can you give us just like a quick intuitive sense of what they are and why Ramanujan was so interested in them? Okay, so imagine like a multi-dimensional grid, like a lattice of points that just goes on forever in every direction. Okay. Theta functions, they help us understand how all those points are arranged and distributed within that grid. Okay. And Ramanujan, he was really interested in this specific kind of theta function that's connected to representing integers as sums of squares. Okay. He actually found these deep connections between those theta functions and something called universal quaternary quadratic forms. Okay, so we're going from sums of squares to multi-dimensional grids to these things called quadratic forms. Yeah. Can we unpack that a little bit? What are quadratic forms and how do they fit into all of this? Okay, so a quadratic form, think of it as a polynomial expression where every term has variables raised to the power of two. Okay. So it's basically representing relationships between these squared quantities. Okay. So for example, you have A squared plus B squared plus C squared plus D squared, that's a quadratic form. Four variables, each one squared. And what makes this particular form really special is that it's universal. That means it can represent all positive integers. So you're saying that every single positive integer can be expressed as the sum of four squares. Exactly. Wow, that's a powerful statement. It is. And that's where A000118 comes in, right? Yes. It's counting how many different ways we can fill in those variables in that quadratic form, A plus B plus C plus D, to represent each integer. Okay, that really clarifies things. So we have Ramanujan making these significant contributions in this area. But I know that there was another mathematician, Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, who also developed a very important theorem related to sums of four squares. You're absolutely right. Didn't he? Jacobi's four square theorem is a major piece of this puzzle. It actually gives us a formula to directly calculate those values in A000118. What it says is that for any positive integer, you can figure out how many ways to write it as the sum of four squares just by looking at its divisors. Hold on, divisors. Yeah. Can you give us like a super quick refresher on divisors and how they relate to all of this? Sure. So divisors, those are the numbers that divide evenly into a given integer. So for example, the divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. And what Jacobi's theorem does is it makes this incredible connection between those divisors and the number of ways that we can write a number as the sum of four squares. So if I'm understanding this correctly, Jacobi's theorem basically gives us a shortcut, a concrete way to calculate those terms in A000118 without having to manually go through and list out every single possible combination of squares. It's a much more elegant and efficient way to figure those values out. Wow. And what's really amazing is that Jacobi's work, along with Ramanujan's explorations, they really set the stage for this whole huge area of research into sums of squares, a field that's still going strong today. So we started with this sequence that just seemed to be about counting sums of squares. And we've uncovered connections to these theta functions, like quadratic forms, and this incredibly powerful theorem by Jacobi. It's a lot more than just a list of numbers, that's for sure. I'm starting to really see how A000118 is much more than just a list of numbers. And we've really just scratched the surface. The sequence, it acts like a bridge, connecting all these different mathematical ideas in really surprising ways. In the next part of our deep dive, we're going to go even deeper, looking at some of those more intricate aspects of A000118, exploring the formulas and generating functions that mathematicians use to really understand its properties. So we've seen how A000118 is connected to all these really advanced mathematical concepts. But I'm curious about the actual formulas that are used to calculate the terms of this sequence. The OEIS entry mentions a few of them. It does. Can we dig into those a little bit? Absolutely. Those formulas give us the concrete tools to work with the sequence. One of the formulas, it uses something called the sum of divisors, which is denoted as sigma. Okay. And it says that An, which is the nth term in the sequence, is equal to 8 times sigma, minus 32 times sigma, and for n greater than 0. Okay. That sounds a little complex. Can you break that down a bit for us? Like, what does that actually mean when we're working with the sequence? Okay, so think about it this way. You have a number n, and you're finding all of its divisors. Okay. All the numbers that divide evenly into it. Right. You add all those up, and then you apply that formula. Okay. So let's say we want to find the sixth term in the sequence. Okay. You would look at the divisors of 6, which are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Right. Add those up, multiply by 8, and then subtract 32 times the sum of the divisors of 6 divided by 4, which is 1 and a half. But in this case, we're only working with integers, so we only consider the integer divisors. So we'd use 1. I see. So the formula is kind of cleverly using those properties of divisors to calculate how many ways we can represent a given number as the sum of four squares. Exactly. It's very elegant. But the OEIS entry also mentioned something called generating functions. Right. Can you explain what those are and why they're important when we're talking about this sequence? Generating functions, they're an incredibly powerful tool in number theory. Okay. So imagine you have a sequence of numbers. We can create a function, a power series, where the coefficients of each term in that series represent the numbers in our sequence. It's basically a way to encode the entire sequence into a single function. So instead of just having a list of numbers, we have this function that kind of holds all the information about the sequence. Exactly. In a compact form. Exactly. That's a neat trick. It is a neat trick. But how do generating functions actually help us understand A000118? Well, A000118, it has several really interesting generating functions. Okay. And each one of them gives us a different way of looking at the sequence. Okay. One of these generating functions, it involves Jacobi's theta function. Okay. Remember those grids we talked about earlier? Yeah. This generating function actually connects A000118 to how points are arranged in a four-dimensional grid. So we're back to multi-dimensional grids. Yes, we are. I have to admit, the idea of a four-dimensional grid is a little harder at my head around. It is. It's tough to visualize. Is there a way we can think about it a bit more intuitively? Yeah. So it's definitely challenging to visualize four dimensions directly.
