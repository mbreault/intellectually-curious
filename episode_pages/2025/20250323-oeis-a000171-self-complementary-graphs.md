## Description

We explore self-complementary graphsâ€”graphs that are isomorphic to their own complement. Weâ€™ll explain why a self-complementary graph on n vertices must have exactly n(nâˆ’1)/4 edges, which accounts for zeros in the sequence (e.g., n = 2, 3, 6, 7). Weâ€™ll look at concrete examples: the 4-vertex case is a path graph, and the 5-vertex case includes a cycle graph, each isomorphic to its complement. Weâ€™ll discuss why existence hinges on more than just the edge-count condition, touch on the diameter constraint (2 or 3), and connect these ideas to OEIS sequence A000171, which counts such graphs on n labeled vertices with initial terms 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 6, 10, 36, ...

## Transcript

All right, welcome to another deep dive where we, you know, dig some really cool math and kind of pick it apart and try to understand it a little better. Yeah, that's right. Today we're going to be talking about something called self-complementary graphs. Now, number theory folks, you know, you might remember the concept of a set complement. Right. So, you know, you've got your universal set and then you have a set within that and the complement is everything that's not in that set. Exactly. And it's a very similar idea when we're talking about graphs in graph theory. So, you know, graphs are made up of points called vertices and lines called edges, which connect those vertices. Right. And the complement of a graph is just the graph on the same set of vertices that has all the edges that the original graph doesn't have and doesn't have the edges that the original graph does have. That's a good way to put it. Yeah, you're just flipping the connections, essentially. Right. So if two vertices are connected by an edge in the original graph, then they're not connected by an edge in the complement and vice versa. Right. On the same set of points. Yeah, right. Exactly. So you can think about it as just, you know, taking all the edges, erasing them, and then drawing in all the edges that weren't there before. So that's the complement of a graph. And that brings us to our topic for today, which is self-complementary graphs. So self-complementary graphs are graphs that are isomorphic to their own complement. Now, isomorphic is a fancy word that just means structurally the same. Yeah, basically structurally identical. Right. So if two graphs are isomorphic, it means that you can relabel the vertices of one graph to get the other graph. So if we have a self-complementary graph, it means that if we take its complement, we can relabel the vertices of the complement to get back the original graph. Exactly. So you take the complement, you relabel the vertices, and you've got the same graph back. Right. And so these are really interesting graphs because they have a lot of cool properties and a lot of really interesting structure. And we're going to be exploring this today through the lens of sequence A000171 in the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Yeah, the OEIS is a great place to look for these kind of patterns in math, and this sequence is a really neat one. Yeah. So this sequence enumerates the number of self-complementary graphs with n vertices. So for example, the first term in the sequence is 1 because there's only one self-complementary graph with one vertex. Right, because with only one vertex, there's only one graph you can make. Exactly. The second term in the sequence is 0 because there are no self-complementary graphs with two vertices. Right. And so on and so forth. So the first few terms of the sequence are 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 6, 10, 36, and so on. And you see all those zeros in there, right? That's pretty interesting. Yeah, and that's kind of a hint that there's something going on here. Yeah, there's some kind of constraint. Right, it's not just any number of vertices that's going to work. Exactly. So let's start by talking about why there are no self-complementary graphs with two vertices. So if you have a graph with two vertices, there are only two possibilities. Either the two vertices are connected by an edge or they're not connected by an edge. And if they're connected by an edge, then the complement has no edges. And if they're not connected by an edge, then the complement has an edge. And so there's no way to relabel the vertices of one of those graphs to get the other graph. Right, you can't relabel a graph with an edge to be a graph without an edge and vice versa. Exactly, so that's why there are no self-complementary graphs with two vertices. And a very similar argument can be made for three vertices. Yeah, basically. Because you can have zero edges or one edge or two edges or three edges. And the complement will have the opposite number of edges. Right, and there's no way to relabel those to get the other. So now let's talk about n is to four. So the sequence tells us that there's one self-complementary graph with four vertices. And it turns out that this graph is what's called a path graph. So a path graph is just a graph where the vertices are all in a line and each vertex is connected to the vertex next to it. Right, just like a straight path. Right, so for example, if we have vertices A, B, C, and D, then a path graph would be A connected to B, B connected to C, and C connected to D. And the complement of this graph would be the graph with edges connecting A to C, A to D, and B to D. And it turns out that these two graphs are isomorphic to each other. You can relabel the vertices of one graph to get the other graph. Yeah, the complement is also a path graph. You just have to relabel the vertices correctly. Exactly. And now let's talk about n5. So the sequence tells us that there are two self-complementary graphs with five vertices. And one of these graphs is a cycle graph. So a cycle graph is just a graph where the vertices are all in a circle and each vertex is connected to the two vertices next to it. Right, like a pentagon in this case. Right, so for example, if we have vertices A, B, C, D, and E, then a cycle graph would be A connected to B, B connected to C, C connected to D, D connected to E, and E connected to A. Right. And the complement of this graph would be the graph with edges connecting A to C, A to D, B to D, B to E, and C to E. And it turns out that these two graphs are isomorphic to each other. Right. Again, the complement is just another cycle graph. Exactly. So that's one of the two self-complementary graphs with five vertices. The other one is a little bit more complicated, but it basically has kind of a central vertex and then two pairs of vertices that are connected to that central vertex and to each other. So those are the two self-complementary graphs with five vertices. And then we get to n6 and n equals 7, and the sequence tells us that there are no self-complementary graphs with 6 or 7 vertices. Right, more of those zeros popping up. Right. So it seems like maybe there's something going on here with the number of vertices. Yeah, it looks like there might be a pattern there. Right. So it turns out that there's a really important property of self-complementary graphs that explains why this is the case. Okay. So a self-complementary graph with n vertices must have exactly n times n minus 1 divided by 4 edges. Interesting. Why is that? Well, so the total number of edges in a complete graph with n vertices is n times n minus 1 divided by 2. Right. And if a graph is self-complementary, it means that it has the same number of edges as its complement. And together, the graph and its complement have all the edges of the complete graph. Right, because if an edge isn't in the original graph, it has to be in the complement. Exactly. So the graph and its complement split the edges of the complete graph evenly. So each of them has to have half the number of edges of the complete graph. Exactly. And that means that each of them has to have n times n minus 1 divided by 4 edges. Right, that makes sense. And so this explains why there are no self-complementary graphs with 6 or 7 vertices. How so? Well, because if you plug in 6 or 7 for n into this formula, you don't get a whole number. Ah. Right. So for 6, you get 6 times 5 divided by 4, which is 152. And for 7, you get 7 times 6 divided by 4, which is 212. Right, and you can't have half an edge. Exactly. So that means that there are no self-complementary graphs with 6 or 7 vertices. Interesting. So is this formula like a rule? Does it mean that if n times n minus 1 divided by 4 is a whole number, then there must be a self-complementary graph with n vertices? That's a great question, and unfortunately it's not quite that simple. So it turns out that this formula is a necessary condition for a self-complementary graph to exist, meaning if a graph is self-complementary, then this formula has to hold, but it's not a sufficient condition. So just because the formula holds for some value of n, it doesn't guarantee that there actually exists a self-complementary graph with that many vertices. Ah, okay. So there could be other reasons why a self-complementary graph doesn't exist, even if the number of edges works out. Exactly. There are a few other interesting properties of self-complementary graphs that are worth mentioning. So, for example, a self-complementary graph with more than one vertex has to have a diameter of either 2 or 3. Okay, now what's diameter again? Remind me. Right, so diameter is the longest shortest path between any two vertices in the graph. So you take every pair of vertices, you find the shortest path between them, and then you take the longest of those paths, and that's the diameter of the graph. Okay, got
