Learn about OEIS  A000204 Lucas Numbers

## Transcript

Welcome to this deep dive into the incredible world of integer sequences. Today, we're zooming in on a really key resource for anyone studying number theory, the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. It's an amazing tool, absolutely essential. And specifically, we're looking at sequence A000204. These are the Lucas numbers. The version that starts with one. Ah, yes. A000204. A classic sequence. It's defined by a recurrence relation that probably feels quite familiar to many listeners. Exactly. It's got that Fibonacci feel, right? Each number is the sum of the two before it. Ln equals Ln-1 plus Ln-2. Precisely the same rule. But the difference, the crucial bit, is the starting values. Right. For this sequence, A000204 kicks off with L1, L2 equal 3. And that's important to pin down because you'll sometimes see Lucas numbers defined slightly differently. The OEIS actually points this out, referencing A000032. Ah, the one starting L0 to L1. That's the one. L0, L1, all one. Which gives 2, 1, 3, 4, 7. Very closely related. Of course, they share the same recurrence. But starting differently means they are, strictly speaking, different sequences with some different properties down the line. Good point. So just to be clear for everyone listening, today we're sticking with A000204. Starting 1, 3. Exactly. 1, 3 it is. So let's get into it. We have 1, 3. Then, okay, 1 plus 3 is 4. Then 3 plus 4 is 7. 4 plus 7 is 11. 7 plus 11 is 18. 11 plus 18. And it keeps going like that. You can really feel that additive structure, just like Fibonacci. It's the core mechanic, definitely. And just a quick note for navigating the OEIS itself for the sequence, A000204 is indexed starting from N1. So L1 is the first term listed. Got it. N1 gives 1 and N2 give 3. Makes sense. Now, one thing I love about the OEIS is how these sequences wear different hats. Oh, absolutely. They show up in unexpected places. Like this one's apparently also called Shout's Accessory Series. That's right, an older name. It pops up in some historical texts. But perhaps more intuitively graspable are the combinatorial interpretations. Okay, like what? Well, Ln actually counts the number of matchings in a cycle graph with N vertices. Matchings in a cycle graph? Yeah, like pairs of edges that don't touch. Exactly. Pairs of non-adjacent edges or single edges or even the empty set, no edges selected, counts as one matching too. Huh. Can you give an example? Sure. Take N4. That's a square, right? L4 is 7. If you draw a square, you can count the ways. Choose no edges, one way. Choose one edge, four ways. Choose two opposite edges, two ways. So 1 plus 4 plus 2, that's 7. Wow. It works out perfectly. It gives a very tangible meaning to the number 7 in this sequence. That's really cool. It makes it feel less abstract. And the OEIS mentions generalizations too, something about covering rings. Yes. It relates to covering a ring lattice. Think of points arranged in a circle with molecules of a certain width, M. For our Lucas numbers, M is 2. So it's like placing dominoes on a circular board. Sort of, yeah. Related to tiling problems. And this naturally connects it to other sequences where M is different, like 3 or 4, which have their own OEIS entries. It shows it's part of a bigger family. Interesting. And then there's a link to dynamical systems. That sounds quite different. It is, but it's a fascinating connection. Ln counts the number of points that have a period of exactly N in something called the golden mean shift. A chaotic system, right? A specific kind, yes. It's pretty remarkable that the count of these periodic points is given by this relatively simple integer sequence. And there's another sequence, L0606, that counts the orbits of these points. Wow. Okay, and what about, like, computer science stuff? Binary strings? Uh-huh. N, which is our Ln, counts the number of circular binary strings, strings of zeros and ones arranged in a circle of length N that don't have two ones next to each other. No consecutive ones in a circular string. Exactly. So for N5, L5 is 11. And you can, if you're patient, list out the 11 5-bit circular strings without 11 appearing, like 0, 1, 0, 0, or 1, 1, 0, 0, or 0, 0, 0, 0. Okay, I'll take your word for 11. That's quite versatile. It also pops up in row sums of certain triangles, A029635 and A182579. That's right. Just another place these numbers make an appearance, showing how interconnected these numerical patterns can be. So shifting gears a bit, what about pure number theory properties? Modular arithmetic? Ah, yes. There are some elegant properties there. A key one mentioned in the OEIS is related to primes. If P is a prime number, then LP is congruent to 1 modulo P. LP leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by P. Precisely. So L3 is 4, which is 1 mod 3. L5 is 11, which is 1 mod 5. L7 is 29, which is 1 mod 7. It holds. Neat. And there's one involving powers of 2. Yes. Attributed to Thomas Wadowski, L2K is congruent to minus 1 modulo 2K plus 1. So like L21, L23, and that's minus 1 mod 2, 1 plus 1 equals 7. Is that minus 1 mod 2 plus 1 equals 8? Yes. 7 is congruent to minus 1 mod 8. Exactly. These kinds of congruences are really useful tools for studying divisibility properties of the sequence. Okay, we can't really talk about Lucas numbers without talking about... Fibonacci numbers. Right. A000045. They're like siblings, aren't they? Very close siblings. They share that fundamental recurrence relation. The OEIS lists several key identities connecting them. Yeah, I saw Ln plus Fn plus 1. That's a fundamental one. It shows how a Lucas number is sandwiched between two Fibonacci numbers, or you can write it as Ln, 2Fn plus 1, Fn. And there are others relating terms with doubled indices. Like F2nn, Fn, the nth Fibonacci times the nth. Lucas gives the 10th Fibonacci. Wow. And also 5Fn nu plus 2 times minus 1n. Or alternatively, Ln to 2 times minus 1n. These identities really show how deeply intertwined they are. You can even define Fibonacci numbers using Lucas numbers, right? Yeah. Fn, Ln1 plus Ln plus 1. That's correct. It shows the relationship goes both ways. And underlying both is the golden ratio, phi? Phi, yes. Just like Fibonacci numbers, Lucas numbers have a beautiful closed-form expression involving phi. It's Ln, Fn plus 1, 5. Where phi is 1 plus square root of 5, 2. And 1 phi is, so that's negative 1 phi, isn't it? Yeah. It is. So you can also write it as Ln, Aos plus An. Or using phi's conjugate, Ai, which is 1, 2, 5, 2. The formula is simply Ln plus N. It's kind of mind-bending that this sequence of whole numbers comes from adding powers of these irrational numbers together. It is. And what's more, for N greater than 1, Ln is actually the closest integer to N. Really? So N is always just a tiny bit away from a Lucas number. Almost exactly. Since the sin term, n-1N, gets very small very quickly as N increases, N gets incredibly close to the integer L. It highlights that exponential growth driven by phi. Okay, let's talk generating functions. These are like compact ways to represent sequences. Exactly. They encode the entire infinite sequence into a single function. For the Lucas numbers, starting L0 to L1, the generating function is xx1 by 2. And that denominator, 1 by m by 2, that looks familiar. It's the same denominator as the Fibonacci generating function, which is sx1 by 2. That shared denominator reflects a shared recurrence relation. Makes sense. The OEIS also mentions a partial fraction decomposition. Yes. cx equals 1, 1, 1 plus 1, 1x. This form directly connects the generating function back to the closed form Binet formula involving Fn that we just discussed. It's often easier to work with for analysis. Right. Now, what about Lucas primes? Ah, an interesting subset. These are simply Lucas numbers that happen to also be prime numbers. Like L2, that's prime. L4 equals 7, prime. L5 equals 11, prime. L7 equals 29, prime. Exactly. Though, a small warning, often when people talk specifically about Lucas primes, they use the sequence starting 2, 1. So, L0, 2 is often considered the first Lucas prime. The OEIS entry, A0005479, lists them, but you need to be mindful of the starting point. Okay,
