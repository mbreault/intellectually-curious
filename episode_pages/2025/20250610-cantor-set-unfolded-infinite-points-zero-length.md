## Description

In this Deep Dive, we unpack the Cantor ternary setâ€”from its simple step-by-step construction by removing middle thirds to the base-3 characterization using digits 0 and 2. We'll explore why the set has zero measure even though it is uncountable, why endpoints remain, and how a simple 0/2-to-0/1 map reveals its connection to binary and the Cantor function. Join our expert guide as we crack intuition, lay out the topology and measure-theory facts, and reveal how this foundational object reshapes our view of infinity in analysis and topology.

## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive, where we take your sources and unpack fascinating topics, really digging into the core ideas. Today we're looking at something quite fundamental in mathematics, a set that's, well, simple to describe but has some truly mind-bending properties, the Cantor set. Yeah, we've got a mix of materials here, academic texts, lecture notes laying out the steps, and even a community discussion digging into the weirder side of it. So our goal today is to walk through these sources, understand how this thing is built, explore why it's so, so counterintuitive, and really see why it's, you know, foundational stuff in analysis and topology. And joining me to help navigate this abstract terrain is our expert guide. Glad to be here. It's a brilliant topic. And yeah, the sources give us a great path. The Cantor set really is one of those things that shows how abstract math can uncover truths our intuition might miss, especially about infinity and space. Let's build it. Okay, let's do it. Construction. The sources mostly talk about the standard one, right? The Cantor ternary set. That's the one. We start simple. Just the closed interval from 0 to 1 on the number line. Think of it like a solid bar, length 1. Step 0, basically. A line segment 0, 1. Solid. Exactly. Now, the process is iterative. Step 1. We remove the open middle third. That's the interval between 13 and 23. So 1323. Open, so not including the endpoints 13 and 23 themselves. Precisely. That's crucial later. So removing 1323 leaves us with two smaller closed intervals. Yes. 0, 1323, 1. Like chopping out the middle section. Your sources probably have pictures showing this. Yeah, I see. Two pieces left, and then we just keep doing that. You got it. Step 2. Apply the exact same rule to each piece we have left. So take the middle third out of 0, 13, that's 1929, gone. And the middle third out of 23, 1, that's 7989, gone. Okay, so now we have four pieces. 0, 19, 29, 13, 23, 79, and 89, 1. Exactly. Four segments. And notice they're shorter. Right, so the number of segments doubles each time, and the length of each segment gets divided by 3. Precisely. At step N, you have 2N segments, each of length 13. And the key thing is this process goes on infinitely. Infinitely, wow. So the Cantor set, often called C, is the set of points that never get removed in this infinite process. It's what's left in the limit. Or, more formally, it's the intersection of all the sets of points remaining at each step. C, C, C, 0, and so on. Okay, so it's what survives this infinite removal. It really feels like there shouldn't be much left at all. Ah, that's the intuitive trap. And this is where it gets fascinating. To really understand what points do remain, the sources correctly point us to thinking in base 3, or ternary. Right. Base 10 is normal. Computers use base 2, binary. Ternary uses digits 0, 1, and 2. How does that unlock the Cantor set? It gives a remarkably clean description. A number x between 0 and 1 is in the Cantor set if and only if it has a ternary representation using only the digits 0 and 2. Only 0s and 2s. No one's allowed anywhere in its base 3 expansion. That's the rule. Think about it. Step 1 removes the interval 13, 23. In ternary, 13 is .1 and 23 is .2. The numbers strictly between them are those whose ternary expansion starts with .1. Ah, okay, so removing the first middle third gets rid of anything that has to start with .1. Exactly. Then in the next step we remove 19, 29, and 79, 89. In ternary, 19 is .01, 29 is .02, 79 is .21, 89 is .22. The removed intervals correspond to numbers whose second ternary digit must be a 1. I see. The removal process systematically eliminates any number that at some point in its ternary expansion requires a 1. Precisely. Let's take an example from the sources. Consider 14. In base 3, that's .020202, repeating. Only 0s and 2s, okay. So by the rule, 14 is in the Cantor set. And importantly, 14 isn't one of the endpoints like 13 or 23, right? Correct. It's a point inside the set, not an endpoint of a removed interval. Now what about those endpoints like 13? Well, in ternary, 13 can be written as .1 exactly, or it can be written as .0222, repeating. Ah, like how .999 equals 1 in base 10. Exactly that kind of ambiguity. Since 13 can be written using only 0s and 2s as .0222, it satisfies the condition and is in the Cantor set. Okay, I see. Same for 23. It could be .2 or .1222. Because it can be written as .200 using only 0s and 2s, it's in the set too. Remember, we removed open intervals. Right, so the endpoints were never actually thrown out. Never. They always remain, and they always have a ternary expansion with only 0s and 2s. So all endpoints of all removed intervals are in the Cantor set. Okay, so the Cantor set is precisely the set of numbers in 0, 1 whose ternary representation can be written using only the digits 0 and 2. That's surprisingly concrete. It is. And this definition is the key that unlocks its, let's say, paradoxical properties. Right, this is where our intuition starts to fray. Let's talk about the size of the set, first in terms of length, or what mathematicians call measure. Yes, measure theory gives us a rigorous way to talk about length. The starting interval 0, 1 has measure 1. What's the measure of the Cantor set? Well, we can figure it out by adding up the lengths of everything we removed. Okay, step 1, we removed one interval of length 13. Right, step 2, we removed two intervals, each of length 13, which is length 19. So that's a total length of 29 removed in that step. Step 3 would be four intervals, each length 13, which equals 27. So 427 removed. Keep going. The total length removed is the sum of an infinite series. 13 plus 29 plus 427 plus 881 plus A. That looks like a geometric series. It is. The first term A is 13, and the common ratio R is 23. And the sum of an infinite geometric series is A1R, provided R1. So 13, 123. Which is 1. Wait. Yeah. The total length of all the bits we took out adds up to 1, the entire length of the original interval. Exactly. So the measure of the Cantor set itself, what's left over is the original measure minus the total measure removed. That's 1, 1 equals 0. 0. So the Cantor set has zero length. It occupies no space on the number line in that sense. Correct. The sources call it a set of measure zero or a null set. It's negligible in terms of length. Okay, that's paradox number 1, zero length. It feels like almost nothing should be left. So maybe just a countable number of points, like just those endpoints we talked about. There's infinitely many of them, but it's a countable infinity, right? It would seem logical, wouldn't it? But here's the kicker. Maybe Cantor's most stunning result related to this set. Despite having measure zero, the Cantor set is uncountable. Uncountable, meaning it has as many points as the original interval 0, 1. Or even the entire real number line. Yes. It has the same cardinality, the same size of infinity as the interval 0, 1. That's the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by C of dollars. Far, far more points than the countable infinity of endpoints. Hold on. How can a set with zero length contain just as many points as a segment that clearly does have length? That seems fundamentally wrong. It shatters our everyday intuition, doesn't it? But we can demonstrate it using that ternary representation. Remember, every point x in the Cantor set has a ternary expansion 0, C, 0s, using only 0s and 2s. Right, only 0s and 2s. Okay, now define a mapping, a function. Take a point x from the Cantor set. Look at its ternary expansion, the one with only 0s and 2s. Now, create a new sequence by replacing every digit 2 with a 1. So 0, 0 or 0 or 2 becomes 0, baby, where bay is Cantor 0 or 1. Exactly. Now, interpret this new sequence 0, bay, 0 as a binary base-2 representation of a number. Okay, so like our earlier example, 14 is 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2
