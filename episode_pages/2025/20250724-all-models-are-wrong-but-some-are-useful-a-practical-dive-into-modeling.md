## Description

A concise exploration of the idea that underpins modern data thinking: models are approximations, not perfect representations. We trace the line from Korzybski and Box to Cox, Gelman, and beyond, unpacking the map-versus-territory metaphor and why usefulness matters more than perfection. With real-world examples like weather forecasts, weâ€™ll discuss how to evaluate a modelâ€™s purpose, assumptions, and blind spotsâ€”and leave you with practical questions to ask before trusting its conclusions.

## Transcript

Welcome to this deep dive where we take your sources and really try to pull out the core insights. Today we're digging into a phrase you hear a lot in statistics, maybe you've heard it. All models are wrong, but some are useful. It's quite a challenging idea, actually. Makes you think differently about data, reality, and especially how useful these models are day to day. Absolutely. And our goal today really is to unpack that. Where did it come from? Why is it still so incredibly important for, well, anyone using information? It's fascinating because it sounds simple, right? But there's so much depth there about how we know things and, crucially, about the practical value, the utility of these models, even knowing they're flawed. Okay, yeah, let's unpack it. So the name everyone links to this is George E.P. Box, British statistician. He used it famously in a 1976 paper, Science and Statistics. Right, Box. And his core message was, well, pretty straightforward. Reality is messy. It's complex. No mathematical or statistical model can capture all of that perfectly. Models have to simplify. It's like a map. A map of London isn't London, obviously, but that doesn't mean the map's useless, does it? Quite the opposite. Its value is in its utility, how it helps you get around, make decisions. Even though it's not the real thing, not perfectly correct. That's a really powerful analogy, the map. Yeah. But I can imagine someone hearing all models are wrong and thinking, well, hang on. How can something wrong be useful? What's the danger if we forget that second part, the useful part? Oh, that's a great point. And it really gets to the heart of the matter, the biggest mistake. Probably thinking the map is the territory. People can fall in love with the model. Maybe it looks elegant or it fits past data incredibly well. They forget it's just a representation. And that leads to problems like overfitting the model knows the past perfectly but fails with anything new. Or worse, making big real-world decisions based on flawed assumptions just because the model said so. Hmm, okay. Now, what I find really interesting here is you mentioned Box in 76, but this idea, it's actually older, isn't it? Looking at the sources. And back in 1933, Alfred Korzybski, he wrote something very similar. A map is not the territory it represents. Exactly, Korzybski. But if correct, it has a similar structure. Yeah. Which accounts for its usefulness. It's the same core idea. And Box himself kept stressing this point. Judge models by their utility, by what they help you do, not by some impossible standard of absolute correctness. So the idea was already there. Yeah, and others touched on it too. John von Neumann, famous mathematician, right? In 1947, he basically said truth is too complicated for anything but approximations. And even before that, you had people like Walter Schuhart in quality control talking about statistical control as an ideal, something you aim for, not a perfect state you actually achieve. Same principle, really. Approximations are key. Okay, so it has these deep historical roots, this understanding that models approximate. Fast forward to today, we're using data and models more than ever. What does this mean for us now? Well, it's definitely fueled a lot of discussion, that's for sure. People built on Box's idea. You had Peter McCullough and John Nelder in their big book on generalized linear models in 83. They pointed out modeling is creative, but no model gets to claim eternal truth. Right, but then does constantly saying all models are wrong actually help? I saw David Cox question that in 95. Yeah, Cox raised a fair point. He wondered if it was maybe a bit unhelpful sometimes. His argument was, look, models have to simplify reality to be useful. That's their job. So he was saying, don't beat them up for doing what they're supposed to do. Kind of, but then others pushed back. J. Michael Steele brought back that map analogy. Yeah, the map simplifies, but that's why it's useful for getting around the city. And Andrew Gelman, he strongly defended the saying because it forces us, well, forces everyone to confront the model's limits, to remember it's not perfect, which is healthy, right? Hmm, keeps you honest about the limitations. Exactly. And then there's this interesting angle from philosopher Peter Truran in 2013. He talked about how you could have different models, maybe even seemingly incompatible ones, that both make accurate predictions. His analogy was like looking at a cylinder. From the side, it looks like a rectangle. From the top, a circle. Both views are wrong in that they're incomplete, but both are useful for understanding different aspects. Okay, that makes sense. Different perspectives, different utilities. So wrapping this up, our deep dive really shows that all models are wrong, but some are useful is, well, it's way more than just a clever line. It's fundamental. It admits our representations aren't perfect reality, but celebrates their power as tools. Especially their statistical utility. Absolutely. At the end of the day, models are there to help us understand something or make a better decision. Think about weather forecasts. They're definitely wrong sometimes, right? The model isn't perfect. But are they useful for deciding whether to bring an umbrella? Absolutely. The focus has to be on purpose. Does it do the job it needs to do? Not, is it magically perfect? Right. So thinking about that for everyone listening, as you come across models, data, forecasts, whatever it might be, maybe the key takeaway is this. If you accept that all models are flawed from the start, what critical questions do you absolutely need to ask about that model's specific job, its purposed, and its built-in blind spots before you decide to trust its conclusions?
