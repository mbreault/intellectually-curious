## Description

We explore groundbreaking research showing bogong moths use star patterns to navigate long-distance migrations, with magnetic cues acting as backup. Through clever experiments and neural recordings, we reveal how a brain the size of a grain of rice reads the Milky Way to reach alpine caves, estivate, and returnâ€”rewriting what we thought insects could do.

## Transcript

Welcome to the deep dive. Have you ever just stopped and thought about animal migration? I mean, really thought about it? These tiny creatures, sometimes billions of them, traveling huge distances to places they've literally never been. How? How do they find their way? Well, it's one of those big nature mysteries, isn't it? It really is. Absolutely fascinating. So today we're diving into the world of a particular insect navigator, an Australian icon actually, the bogong moth. Ah, yes, the bogong moth. Quite the traveler. Exactly. Billions, literally billions, take off every year across southeastern Australia. It sounds almost unbelievable when you say it out loud. It does. And our mission today is really to unpack some fantastic new research. It's pretty cutting edge stuff that's revealed this previously unknown navigational skill they have. Okay. It's something really sophisticated, a feat we honestly only thought animals like birds or maybe sea turtles were capable of, not insects. Wow. Okay. So it really shifts things. It absolutely does. Changes how we think about insect abilities. So let's paint the picture of this journey first. The scale is just immense. These moths can fly up to 1,000 kilometers. Right. 1,000 kilometers. That's huge. Yeah. And I mean, think about that distance, like flying from, say, Paris to Berlin for an insect that's barely bigger than your thumb. No map, no GPS. And crucially, no prior experience of the destination. Exactly. And it's not just one way, is it? There's a whole cycle. That's right, which makes it even more amazing. It's very precise, tied to the seasons. So in spring, you have the newly emerged moths. They fly from these warmer inland areas where they hatched. Okay. And they head for a very specific small number of cool caves way up in the Australian Alps, places like Mount Selwyn. And again, these moths have never been there. It's their first trip. That's the mind-bending part, flying towards a target they can't see and don't know. So what happens when they get there? Well, they arrive, find these caves, and then they basically just chill out for the summer. It's called estivation. Like hibernation, but for heat. Sort of, yeah. A summer dormancy. They just hang out sometimes for three or four months. And the numbers, I mean, you mentioned billions migrating. Well, inside these caves, it gets incredibly dense. They have measured up to 16,000 moths in a single square meter. 16,000 per square meter. That's hard to even visualize. It's an unbelievable site, apparently. But here's the kicker. Come autumn, it's those same moths. The very same ones, not their kids? Nope. The exact same individuals wake up, and they make the return journey. All the way back to where they started. Wow. Back to the breeding grounds. They reproduce, lay their eggs, and then, well, their journey ends. Their life cycle is complete. So the huge question has always been navigation. How do they find that specific cave system hundreds of kilometers away, having never seen it, and then find their way back months later? Precisely. It's not like they're leaving breadcrumbs, right? We knew some things from earlier work. We knew they could sense the Earth's magnetic field. Internal compass. Exactly, a magnetic compass. And we knew they used visual landmarks, too. So they weren't navigating blind. They had tools. But visual landmarks? Pretty broad. Was it mountains on the horizon? The moon, maybe? Or something else up there? You know, people wondered about the stars, especially in the southern hemisphere, with the Milky Way being so prominent. That was the big hypothesis. Could they be using the stars? And that's what this new research tackled head on, using a really clever experimental setup. Okay, talks about that. They used something called a Moritzen-Frost flight simulator. It's basically like a tiny arena where a moth is tethered. Tethered. Yeah, gently, so it can fly in place. But the simulator measures exactly which direction it's trying to fly. It lets you control what the moth sees and senses. Okay, so you can test different conditions. Precisely. So phase one. They put the moths in the simulator under a natural, moonless night sky. Real stars. And crucially, with the Earth's natural magnetic field present. Just to see, you know, baseline behavior. Did they fly the right way? They did. Consistently. Moths tested in autumn flew north, just like they should for the return migration. But what was really interesting was that they kept that correct heading even hours later, when the stars and moon had visibly shifted in the sky. So they weren't just locked onto one bright star. They were compensating somehow. Exactly. It suggested a much more sophisticated system. But here's the real clincher for the magnetic sense. Even when it got heavily cloudy, completely obscuring the stars. No visual cues at all. Right. They still oriented correctly. Wow. So that magnetic compass is definitely real, and it works even without stars. It strongly reinforced that, yes. It's a reliable backup, or perhaps even primary sometimes. Which then led to the obvious question. If the magnetic field works so well, do they even need the stars? Exactly. Which brings us to phase two. This is the really cool part, the aha moment. Okay, I'm ready. Right. So they needed to isolate the stellar compass. To do that, they had to eliminate the magnetic one. They moved the experiment into a special lab, shielded from external magnetic fields. Like a Faraday cage, but for magnetism? Sort of, yes. A ferromagnetic-free lab. And inside, they used what's called a Helmholtz coil system. It's basically a set of coils that can generate a magnetic field to perfectly cancel out the Earth's field. Okay, so zero magnetic information for the moth. None at all. Correct. Now, the moths could only rely on visual cues. So what did they show them? Let me guess. Stars? Yep. They projected a realistic, moonless, starry night sky onto a screen above the simulator. Then, as a key test, they showed the same sky, but rotated 180 degrees. Oh, clever. Flip the map. Exactly. And one more control. A sky with the stars just randomly scattered. Same amount of light, but no pattern. To make sure they weren't just flying towards any light. Precisely. And the results were just definitive. Okay. Under the normal, correctly oriented sky, remember, no magnetic field. Now, the moths flew in the right direction for the season. South in spring, north-northwest in autumn, just using the stars. So the stellar compass works on its own. It does. But the absolute proof came when they rotated the sky 180 degrees. What happened? The moths completely reversed their direction. They turned almost exactly 180 degrees, following the flipped stars. Wow. That's undeniable. They are reading the star patterns. Undeniable proof. And, as expected, under the randomized star pattern, they just flew randomly. Totally disoriented. It confirmed they need the pattern, the spatial information, not just the light. That is genuinely amazing. So this is the first time we've seen an invertebrate use stars for, like, goal-oriented long-distance travel. Not just keeping straight. That's the crucial distinction, yes. We knew dung beetles used the Milky Way, but more like just keeping in a straight line away from the dung pile. Simple orientation. Right. The bogong moth is using the stars to find a specific destination hundreds of kilometers away and then find its way back. That's complex navigation, more like what we see in birds or even us. It's a game-changer for insect science. It really is. A brain the size of a grain of rice doing all that. Which naturally makes you wonder, how? What's going on inside that tiny brain? Right. The next step was to peek inside. Researchers used electrophysiology, basically listening in on the electrical activity of individual neurons in the moth's brain while it viewed these sky patterns. Where in the brain did they look? Key areas known to be involved in vision and navigation. The optic lobe, that's the first stop for visual information. Then the central complex, or CX, it's widely considered the insect's internal compass and navigation hub. Okay. And also the lateral accessory lobes, the LAL, which seem to be involved in controlling steering and turning. And what did they hear? What were the neurons doing? They found neurons that were clearly tuned to the sky's orientation. Specific cells would fire most strongly when the starry sky was at a particular angle. So like a neuron for north, maybe? Sort of. But what was really striking was a consistent pattern. Many of these neurons, these unimodal cells, showed their peak activity clustered around 171 degrees, which corresponds roughly to south in the southern hemisphere. So a lot of cells were basically signaling south, regardless of whether it was spring or autumn. It seems that way. A kind of common south tuning. And importantly, these cells didn't fire when shown the random star patterns. Confirming they're reacting to the structure of the sky, not just light or movement. Exactly. They even tested artificial cues, like a single dot moving like a bright star, or a bar rotating to mimic the Milky Way's band. These also got responses, suggesting the moths might indeed be using the overall shape or bright parts of the Milky Way. It looks like the optic lobe processes the view, the central complex figures out the heading, and the LAL helps execute the turn. It's like a whole navigation suite in miniature. It really is. So pulling it all together, what we have is this
