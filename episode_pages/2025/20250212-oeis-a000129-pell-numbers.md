## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing deep dive into the amazing world of the OEIS. Wow. Today. It's a fascinating world for sure. We're cracking open A000129. Right. The Pell numbers. It's a sequence that's been puzzling and delighting mathematicians for centuries. Indeed, the Pell numbers offer a captivating blend of simplicity and depth. I believe it. They're ready to be captivated. Pop up in unexpected places, connecting seemingly disparate areas of number theory. Let's start with the basics. Okay. How are Pell numbers actually defined? Well, much like their famous cousins, the Fibonacci numbers. Right. Pell numbers are defined by a recurrence relation. Okay. We start with A0 equals 0 and A1 equals 1. Got it. Then for any n greater than 1, the nth Pell number is simply twice the n-1's Pell number plus the n-2th Pell number. So we're building each term by adding the previous two, but with a twist? Yeah. That coefficient of two in front of the n-th term seems to be the key difference. You've hit the nail on the head. That seemingly minor tweak sets the Pell numbers on a unique trajectory, leading to a whole new set of fascinating properties. Speaking of fascinating properties. Right. Okay. I've heard that Pell numbers have a special connection to the square root of 2. They do. Can you tell us more about that? Absolutely. This connection goes way back. Ancient Indian and Greek mathematicians were already intrigued by the fact that Pell numbers appear as denominators in the closest rational approximations to the square root of 2. Wait, so you're telling me that centuries ago. That's right. Mathematicians were using these numbers to get incredibly accurate approximations of an irrational number. They even knew about the approximation 577408, which is remarkably accurate considering they didn't have calculators or computers. That's mind boggling. It is? How did they even figure that out? It all boils down to the continued fraction expansion of the square root of 2. Oh. If you truncate this expansion at different points, you get fractions where the denominators are Pell numbers, and the numerators are closely related to Pell numbers. So Pell numbers provide a sort of secret code to unlock the mysteries of the square root of 2. Precisely. Wow. And this connection goes even deeper. Okay. If you think about constructing a regular octagon, you can use Pell numbers to define the coordinates of its vertices, leading to incredibly accurate rational approximations. So we're not just talking about abstract number theory here. Right. Pell numbers have a tangible connection to geometry as well. Exactly. Interesting. They bridge the gap between the theoretical and the visual. Right. Which is part of what makes them so fascinating. Now I understand that Pell numbers also have some intriguing properties related to? They do. Prime numbers and perfect powers. Can you elaborate on that? Certainly. Let's start with Pell primes. Okay. Which are Pell numbers that are also prime numbers. Got it. The first few examples are 2, 5, and 29. Okay. What's particularly remarkable is that the indices of these primes within the Pell sequence are also prime. For instance, 29 is the fifth Pell number, and both 5 and 29 are prime. That's a fascinating pattern. Yeah. It's like there's a hidden layer of primes within the primes. Indeed. Wow. It hints at a deeper structure. Right. Governing the distribution of primes within the Pell sequence. Now when it comes to perfect powers. Okay. Pell numbers are surprisingly rare. The only Pell numbers that are perfect powers are 0, 1, and 169. Okay. Which is 13 squared. So while prime Pell numbers seem to be relatively common. It seems that way. Finding a Pell number that's a perfect cube or higher power is incredibly unlikely. Exactly. It's a testament to the unique structure of these numbers. Yeah. And how they relate to other mathematical concepts. This is already so much to digest, and we've only just begun to scratch the surface. There's always more to uncover. Okay. Let's move on to a particularly mind-bending concept. The link between Pell numbers and square triangular numbers. Okay. Now you've got my full attention. How can a number be both a perfect square and a triangular number at the same time? Right. It seems almost paradoxical. It does, doesn't it? Yeah. But there's a specific mathematical identity that beautifully illustrates this connection. Let's hear it. Okay. All right. It involves a bit of algebraic maneuvering with Pell numbers. Okay. But the essence is this. Yeah. You can build square triangular numbers directly from certain Pell numbers. So Pell numbers act like a recipe for these special numbers. You could say that. That inhabit both the world of squares and triangles. And this leads us to another intriguing sequence. Okay. The Newman-Shanks-Williams NSW numbers. NSW numbers. Okay. Now I'm really curious. What's the connection there? Well, the NSW numbers are derived from Pell numbers. And they have the remarkable property of being the square roots of square triangular numbers. Hold on. I'm trying to visualize this. Okay. We've got Pell numbers. Right. Which can generate square triangular numbers. We've got NSW numbers. Which are derived from Pell numbers. Yes. And are the square roots of those very same square triangular numbers. Precisely. Mind blown. It's like a fascinating mathematical nesting doll. So Pell numbers not only unlock the square root of 2. Right. But also open the door to this intricate world of square triangular numbers and NSW numbers. Exactly. Wow. And that's just the beginning. Really? Pell numbers also play a surprising role. Okay. In generating Pythagorean triples. Pythagorean triples. You mean those sets of three integers that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem? You got it. Okay. And Pell numbers can be used to generate a special kind of Pythagorean triple. Okay. Where the two legs differ by only one unit. So we're talking about right triangles that are almost isosceles? That's unexpected. Indeed. Wow. And the formula for generating these triples is quite elegant. For any Pell number, you can construct a Pythagorean triple of the form 2pn, pn plus 1, pn plus 1, 2pn, 2, pn plus 1, 2 plus pn 2. That last term, by the way, is simply the 2n plus 1 Pell number. Wow. The patterns are everywhere once you start looking. They are. And the best part is we've only just begun to explore the depths of these remarkable sequences. You're absolutely right. Wow. There's a whole other sequence. Okay. Intertwined with the Pell numbers. The Pell-Lucas numbers. Companion Pell numbers. I'm intrigued. Also known as the companion Pell numbers. What makes them such good companions? They're defined by a very similar recurrence relation to the Pell numbers, with just a slight tweak in the initial values. Got it. Instead of starting with 0 and 1, the Pell-Lucas numbers start with 2 and 2. So they follow the same rule of adding the previous two terms. And just as there's a special relationship between Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, there's a beautiful connection between Pell and Pell-Lucas numbers. I'm guessing it has something to do with those rational approximations to the square root of 2 we talked about earlier? You're on the right track. Okay. Remember how we said that the denominators of those approximations are Pell numbers? Yeah. Well, the numerators are precisely half the corresponding Pell-Lucas numbers. That's incredible. It is. Like these two sequences are dancing together, each playing a crucial role in unlocking the secrets of the square root of 2. And it gets even better. Okay. Just like with the Pell numbers, there are Pell-Lucas primes. These are Pell-Lucas numbers that are also prime. Interesting. And guess what? Yeah. The condition for a Pell-Lucas number to be prime is remarkably similar to the condition for a Pell number to be prime. So not only do these sequences share a connection to the square root of 2, but their primality conditions are also linked. Precisely. Wow. It's a testament to the deep and intricate relationships woven throughout number theory. This is all so fascinating. It is. I'm already eager to hear more about these companion Pell numbers. We'll get there. But for now, I think we need a moment to let all this information sink in. Okay. It's like our brains have been doing a Pell number workout. I agree. A little mental break will do us good. All right. We'll be back soon to continue our exploration of these captivating sequences. Okay. All right. Sounds good. See you then. See you then. Welcome back. Yeah. Before our little mental break, we were marveling at the intricate dance between Pell and Pell-Lucas numbers, their connection to the square root of 2, and their surprising primality conditions. It's amazing how these seemingly simple sequences keep revealing hidden depths. It makes me wonder, are there other ways to represent and calculate these numbers besides the recurrence relations we discussed earlier? One fascinating approach involves matrices. Matrices. Right. How do matrices enter the picture? Imagine a simple 2x2 matrix with entries 1, 2, 1, and 1. Okay. If you raise this matrix to the nth power, the top left entry gives you the nth Pell-Lucas number, and the bottom left entry gives you the nth Pell number. Wait. Seriously? It's true. So just by repeatedly multiplying this basic matrix by itself, we can generate both sequences. That's wild. It really is. Wow. It highlights the unexpected power of linear algebra to capture and express complex numerical patterns. And there's another matrix representation that's even more visually striking. Okay. If you create a 2x2 matrix with entries Hn,
