## Transcript

Welcome back to our OEIS Deep Dive. You know, we love unearthing these hidden gems in the vast universe of integer sequences. Today, well, we're diving into sequence A000139. And, you know, this one I think is going to be particularly interesting for number theory people out there. Yeah, it's a really cool sequence. It's a fantastic example of how a seemingly simple formula can connect like all these different areas of math. Okay, let's start with the formula itself. Sure. n plus 1. I think I'm already seeing all those factorials. I'm getting a sense that this sequence is going to grow pretty quickly. Absolutely. Yeah. Factorials are a strong indication that we're dealing with combinatorial objects. Arrangements, structures, that kind of thing. Yeah. But it's the variety of objects this formula counts that makes it so intriguing. Okay, unpack that for us a little bit. Sure. The OEIS entry mentions two-stack sortable permutations. Right. So we're talking algorithms here. Precisely. Okay. Imagine you have a stack of items and you want to sort them using two additional stacks. But there are rules. Okay. A two-stack sortable permutation is a valid arrangement you can achieve through this process. So this sequence is telling us how many different ways we can sort using that two-stack method. Interesting, but it seems a little far from number theory. Yeah, that's where it gets fascinating. Okay. This same sequence also counts rooted non-separable planar maps. Okay. These are ways to connect points on a plane, like a network, where removing any single connection splits the network into pieces. Hold on. From sorting with stacks to networks on a plane, how can one formula count things that seem so different? That's the beauty of this sequence. It suggests a deeper mathematical structure connecting these seemingly unrelated concepts. And it doesn't stop there. Go on. A000139 also counts the number of ways to dissect a square into smaller squares with n plus 1 vertices. Wait, so if I take a square and try to divide it up into smaller squares, the number of ways I can do that is given by this sequence. That's right. Wow. Okay, I'm starting to see how this one formula is like weaving together all these different mathematical ideas. Exactly. And there's more. Uh-huh. This sequence also counts left ternary trees, a specific type of data structure. Each node has three branches. Okay. The number of possible trees with n nodes, again, given by our formula. Okay, now I'm really seeing the scope of this thing. Yeah. We've got algorithms, graph theory, data structures, all connected by this one formula. It's pretty amazing. It makes you wonder what the underlying connection is, the thing that ties these concepts together. It's a question that has fascinated mathematicians for a long time. Yeah. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Oh, no. A000139 has even more surprising connections. Okay. Things like fighting fish, those branching shapes, and specific arrangements of dominoes. Dominoes, wow. It's a sequence that keeps on giving. This is already blowing my mind. We've got this formula. It connects all these different combinatorial objects. Yeah. But what about the formula itself? I mean, those factorials, they scream fast growth. But can we be more precise about how this sequence grows? Absolutely. Okay. We can use Stirling's approximation to derive an asymptotic formula for A000139. Okay. Stirling's approximation. Now that rings a bell from my number theory classes. Exactly. It's really helpful for understanding the behavior of sequences with factorials. Right. In this case, it tells us that A grows approximately like divided by a factor involving the square root of n and some additional terms. So it's essentially exponential growth, but with a little bit of a break from that denominator. Exactly. The A tells us the sequence grows roughly 6.5 times larger with each increase in n. Right. But the denominator refines that estimate and gives a more precise picture of the growth pattern. So we've got the formula. We've got this incredible diversity of combinatorial connections. Right. And now we have a clearer sense of its growth pattern. Yeah. What else is there to uncover about this sequence? Well, there's the fascinating world of generating functions. Okay. Ordinary, exponential, and even continued fraction forms. Wow. All associated with A000139. Generating functions, they're like mathematical power tools for analyzing sequences, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. We might not have time to really delve into the specifics today. Sure. But it's exciting to know they exist for this sequence. Right. A000139. And speaking of connections. Yes. A000139 is also linked to other OEIS sequences. Of course. Like A000142, which deals with Stirling numbers. Right. Those pop up everywhere in combinatorics. Yeah, they do. And then there's A0001764, which counts ternary trees. Bringing us back to those branching structures. Full circle. It's like we're exploring this vast interconnected web of mathematical ideas. Absolutely. With A000139 as our guide. That's a great way to put it. And who knows what other connections are out there just waiting to be discovered. It really is amazing. This sequence is a perfect example of how exploring the OEIS database can lead to unexpected and fascinating mathematical journeys. Absolutely. I couldn't agree more. Yeah, it really highlights the power of this database. It does. It's not just a catalog of sequences. It's a tool for finding these hidden relationships. Right. And starting new mathematical investigations. Absolutely. It makes you wonder, with all these connections, what practical applications might come out of understanding A000139 more deeply? That's a great question. Yeah. And while some of these connections seem purely abstract. Right. They do have implications for fields like computer science and network analysis. Okay, like for instance, we talked about sorting algorithms earlier. Right. Efficient sorting is crucial in computer science. Absolutely. And understanding these two-stack sortable permutations could lead to new, more efficient sorting algorithms. Precisely. And those rooted, non-separable planar maps. Right. Think of them as models for robust networks. Okay. Where the network stays connected even if one connection fails. Right. This is directly relevant to designing resilient infrastructure, like communication networks or transportation systems. So we're seeing a potential bridge between theoretical combinatorics and real-world problem solving. Exactly. And who knows what other applications are waiting to be discovered. Right. Perhaps there are connections to cryptography or coding theory areas where number theory is crucial. This is what I find so exciting about the OEIS database. Yeah.
