## Description

We unpack A000113, which counts the number of distinct transformation groups of order n. Weâ€™ll explore how prime factorization, Dedekindâ€™s psi function, and the exponents arising from the factorization feed into the terms, and what strong divisibility and multiplicativity reveal about the structure of transformation groups.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing exploration of the OEIS. Yeah, glad to be back. Today we're diving into sequence A000113. Right. A sequence that's particularly interesting for number theory enthusiasts like yourself. Oh yeah, this one's pretty neat. You might not seem immediately captivating? No. But trust me, this sequence leads to some pretty elegant mathematical concepts. Definitely. We're talking about the number of transformation groups of order n. That's a good one. Transformation groups. A topic that can seem a bit abstract at first. Yeah. Can you give us a quick overview? Sure, sure. For those who might need a refresher? Yeah, so a transformation group is essentially a collection of transformations that can be applied to an object without changing its fundamental structure. Okay. So imagine rotating a square. Right. You're changing its orientation but not its shape. I see. These transformations could be rotations, reflections, or translations. Okay. And they have to follow certain rules to form a group. So if we consider all the possible rotations of a square, that would be an example of a transformation group. Precisely. Okay. The rotations of a square meet all the requirements of a group. Got it. Closure, meaning combining any two rotations results in another rotation within the group. Right. An identity element which leaves the square unchanged. Okay. So a rotation of zero degrees. Got it. And an inverse for each rotation, which would be rotating in the opposite direction. So each rotation has its counterpart that undoes it. Exactly. That makes sense. Yeah. Now how does A000113 connect to all of this? So A000113 counts the number of distinct transformation groups for each order n. Right. In simpler terms, it tells you how many different ways you can transform an object using n transformations while preserving its structure. So for instance, the first term of the sequence would represent the number of transformation groups with just one transformation. Exactly. And if we look at the first few terms, we see it starts with 1, 3, 4, 3, 6. Yeah. It's not immediately obvious. Really. What the pattern is. Right. Which makes it all the more intriguing. Yeah. That's where Dedekind's psi function comes into play, right? Yes. From what I've read, this function helps us calculate the terms of this sequence. You're absolutely right. Okay. While there isn't a simple closed form expression for A000113, we can use Dedekind's psi function, developed as chef, to determine its terms. I'm guessing this involves a bit of number theory magic. A little bit, yeah. Can you walk us through how it works? So the calculation involves a few steps. Okay. First, we break down the order n into its prime factorization. Got it. Writing it as 2 to the i times 3 to the j times k, where k is not divisible by 2 or 3. So we're essentially finding the building blocks of n in terms of prime numbers. That's right. What's the next step? Then based on the exponents i and j from the prime factorization, we define two auxiliary variables, i and j. These variables help us adjust the psi function based on the specific structure of the prime factorization. So depending on the values of i and j, we'll have different values for i and j, which will ultimately influence the final calculation. Precisely. And finally, to get the nth term of the sequence, a, we use the formula an equals n divided by 2 to the n times 3 to the j equals n divided by 2 to the n times 3 to the j. That's it. So we take the psi function of a modified version of n based on the prime factorization. And that gives us the number of transformation groups for that order. It sounds a bit complex. It is a little bit, yeah. But I'm starting to see the connections here. Yeah, it all comes together. What makes A000113 truly fascinating are its special properties. Definitely. I've heard about those. Okay. Strong divisibility, right? Right. Can you explain what that means in the context of this sequence? So strong divisibility is a property that links the terms of the sequence in a very specific way. Okay. It means that the greatest common divisor of any two terms in the sequence is equal to the term at the index of the greatest common divisor of the original two indices. Okay, that sounds a bit abstract. Yeah. Could you give us an example to illustrate that? Of course. Okay. Let's say you pick two terms from the sequence. Okay. A of 6, of 10. Right. The greatest common divisor of 6 and 10 is 2, right? Right. So the strong divisibility property tells us that the greatest common divisor of 6 and of 10 will be equal to 2. So of 2 is going to be the greatest common divisor of 6 and of 10. Exactly. This property might seem like a coincidence. Yeah. But it points to a deeper connection between the terms of A000113. It's like this sequence has an internal structure. Right. That dictates how its terms relate to each other. Yeah. Based on their greatest common divisors. That's pretty remarkable. It is pretty neat. Now I'm also curious about this other property you mentioned earlier. Oh, yeah. Multiplicativity. Okay. How does that tie into the whole picture? So multiplicativity in the context of A000113 means that if you have two relatively prime numbers, m and n, then the term corresponding to their product, A of m times n, will be equal to the product of the terms corresponding to each number individually. Okay. A of m times A of n. So if we know the number of transformation groups for two relatively prime orders, we can easily calculate the number of transformation groups for their product. Precisely. This property is not just a mathematical quirk. No. It reflects a fundamental aspect of the structure of transformation groups. Right. It suggests that you can build larger transformation groups from smaller ones. Yes. When their orders are relatively prime. That's right. It's like these properties are giving us clues about how transformation groups can be constructed and combined. Yeah. They give us insight into the structure. It's fascinating to see how these seemingly abstract concepts have such concrete implications. Definitely. And that's just the beginning. Right. There's one more aspect we need to explore. Okay. And that's the asymptotic behavior of the sequence. Right. This tells us what happens to the sequence as n gets really large, right? That's right. Does it grow rapidly or does it level off? In the case of A000130, the sum of the first n terms grows quadratically. Okay. That means it increases proportionally to n squared. So as we consider larger and larger orders, the total number of transformation groups increases at an accelerating pace. Exactly. It's mind-boggling to think about the sheer number of transformation groups that exist as we explore higher orders. It's quite amazing. We've covered a lot of ground. Yeah, we have. From basic definitions to Dedekind's psi function. Right. And the unique properties of A000113. Definitely. But before we wrap up, I think it would be helpful to revisit the formula for calculating the terms. Right. And maybe work through a concrete example. I think that's a good idea. To really bring these concepts to life. Yeah, a concrete example can really help. Let's consider the rotations of a square again. We have four distinct rotations. Right. Zero degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees. Okay. This forms a transformation group of order 4. That's right. So if we want to find the corresponding term in A000113 using Dedekind's psi function, where do we start? So we begin by determining the prime factorization of 4, which is 2 squared. All right. So in this case, i equals 2. Okay. And j and k are both 0. Right. Because there are no other prime factors. So the prime factorization gives us our starting point. Yeah. Now, how do we determine the values of i and j? So for i, we look at the value of i, since i is 2, which is less than 6. i is calculated as the floor of i divided by 2, which is 1. Got it. And j is simply 0 because j is 0. So we have n equals 4, e equals 1, and j equals 0. Right. Now we plug these values into the formula. Okay. a of n equals n divided by 2 to the i times 3 to the j equals of 4 divided by 2 to the 1 times 3 to the 0. Okay. That simplifies to pill of 2. Okay. Now to calculate 2, we need to recall the definition of Dedekind's psi function. Okay. It's defined as fm equals m times the product of 1 plus 1 divided by p for all prime divisors p of m. So of 2, the only prime divisor is 2. Correct. That means of 2 equals 2 times 1 plus 1 divided by 2 equals 3. Precisely. And if you check the fourth term of A000113, you'll find that it is indeed 3. You got it. This confirms that our calculation using Dedekind's psi function is correct. Exactly. Wow, that's really neat. It is pretty neat. We've actually calculated a term in the sequence using this seemingly complex function. Yeah, we did it. It's amazing how all these pieces fit together. They do. Before we move on, I'd love to get your perspective on something. Sure. We've talked about these abstract properties like strong divisibility and multiplicativity. Yeah. But what's the real significance
