## Description

In this episode we dive into A000229, the sequence of the smallest moduli n for which 2 is the least quadratic non-residue. We start with quick reminders of quadratic residues and non-residues, the Legendre symbol, and how residues interact when you move to composite moduli via the Chinese remainder theorem. We unpack what it means for 2 to be the least non-residue and why this simple condition ties together primes, modular arithmetic, and residue classes. The discussion then connects to related ideasâ€”testing non-residues, related OEIS sequences, and the role of quadratic reciprocityâ€”before turning to what is known about how large the first non-residue can be, both unconditionally and under hypotheses like ERH. We also outline practical ways to compute terms and point you to resources in OEIS and the literature for deeper exploration.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our ongoing series on the OEIS for number theory students. Today we're doing a deep dive into, well, a pretty fascinating sequence, A000229. Ah, yes. This one connects primes and quadratic residues in a really specific way. Exactly. So maybe let's start with the basics. Quadratic residues and non-residues. What are we talking about there? Sure. So take an integer n, we say a number 2$ is a quadratic residue modulo. Well, if you can find some integer 6$ such that 6$ squared gives you 2$ when you reduce modulo n. Right, 6$ equiv q mod, like mod 5$ is a residue because 2$ is 2$ is 4$. Precisely. And if you can't find such a 6$, then tell her is a quadratic non-residue modulo n. Okay. And there's this nice property for odd primes, right? Like 2$. Yes, exactly. If you look at the numbers from 1 up to p$, exactly half of them are quadratic residues and the other half are non-residues. So p1, 2$ of each. That's a neat balance. And that leads to the Legendre symbol. It does. The Legendre symbol written in teller is just shorthand. It's 1 if it is a residue modulo n, minus 1 if it's a non-residue. And 0 if p actually divides a dollar. Right. Super useful. Okay, so with that background, let's get to the main event. OEIS sequence A000229. What defines this sequence, NM? So M is defined as the least positive integer dollar such that the long prime number, let's call it 2$. Like p2, p3, p4, 5, and so on. Exactly, those primes. We want the smallest dollar where TIS is the least quadratic non-residue modulo dollar. Whoa, okay, so two conditions there. QPIS has to be a non-residue modulo dollar? Yes. And crucially, every positive integer smaller than PS, so 1$, 2$, PN, 1$, must all be quadratic residues modulo dollars. Ah, I see. So PPR is the first number you hit that doesn't have a square root modulo. That's the key. It's a very specific structural requirement on dollar dilled dictated by the Noth's prime. It really ties the prime sequence to this modular property. It does, and that's why it's interesting. You're seeing how the sequence of primes influences this multiplicative structure. Okay, maybe we can make quadratic non-residue a bit more concrete. How do we find them? You mentioned checking 6$ equiv Q mod or not. Right, and you don't have to check all possible 6$, because if MT2N and Willer the same modulo, you really only need to check 6$ from dollars up to, well, floor of 10$. Makes sense. Saves some computation. Math World has some tables that are helpful here. They list non-residues for small dollars. Like for ON3 to 3, the only non-residue among 1, 2 is 2. For N5 and 2 and 3 are non-residues. So the smallest non-residue for ON3 dollars and for N5 and 5 is also 2. Correct. And the sequence of these smallest quadratic non-residues for N3, 4, 5 dollars is actually another OEIS sequence, A020649. Okay, and what if we only look at prime moduli? PP dollars. Is there a sequence for the smallest non-residue then? Yes, that's A053760. It starts 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 5. You can see it's often 2, but not always. For 200 dollars, the smallest non-residue is 3. For 2 to the power of 2, 203, it's 5. So it jumps around. Is there any limit to how large that smallest non-residue can get relative to 2 dollars? That's a big question in number theory. Unconditionally, we don't have a great bound. But if you assume the extended Riemann hypothesis, the ERH... Which is a major unsolved hypothesis. Indeed. But if it's true, then we know the first non-residue modulo of this pre-smarts less than log P2. Okay, log P2 is much, much smaller than PD itself. That's quite a strong prediction. It is. It tells us we expect to find a non-residue relatively quickly. All right, let's bring it back to A000229. We have AN as the smallest dollar where 2 is the least non-residue. Correct. So for N111, we want the smallest dollar where 2 is the least non-residue. That means 1 must be a residue. Well, 1 is always 12, so 1 is always a residue. So we just need 2 to be a non-residue. What's the smallest dollar where 2 is a non-residue? We saw that for N3 dollars, 2 dollars is a non-residue. Are there smaller dollar for N11 dollars, 22? The concept isn't quite the same. So 1 all, lon, equals 3, 3. Okay, what about 1 on 2, 2? That's 2, 2, 3 dollars. We want the smallest dollar where 3 is the least non-residue. Right. So 1 must be a residue, and 2 must also be a residue modulo dollars, and 3 must be a non-residue. Let's try small null. 1 equiv 1, 1 is rest, 2 is non-rest. Doesn't work, 3 isn't the least non-rest. 1 wing or vertgoemp. 22 equiv 0, 32 equiv 9, equiv 1. Only 1 is a residue among 1, 2, 3. 1 equiv rest, 2 is non-rest. Doesn't work, 1 equiv 12, 52 equiv others' non-rest. 22 equiv 4, 3, 32 equiv 3, 3, 42 equiv 52, 32, 3. You have to be careful with composite moduli. Mod 1, it goes rest, 12, 1, 22, but does 32 equiv 32, 9, 3, 2, 3, 5, 6. Smallest non-residue is 3. Does that work? Let's check. Modulus 7, 1 is a residue, 12, 2 is a residue, 3, 2, 3 is a non-residue. Yes, 3 is the least non-residue modulus 7. It's 7 the smallest integer. We checked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 here. Seems plausible. So 2 under it equivocal. Okay, so the sequence starts N22 on Coronas. It feels like finding these dollars could get complicated quickly. It can. You're essentially solving a system of quadratic congruences and non-congruences. I saw MathWorld also has tables related to this, like values of n such that the smallest quadratic non-residue. How does that connect? Ah, right. Those sequences, like A025022 for 220, for 2 equals, list the moduli in dollars for which 2 is the smallest non-residue. A025021 does it for 233 and so on. So they fix the non-residue first and find the moduli. Exactly. And 000229 flips it. We fix the prime p dollars that we want to be the least non-residue, and then we find the smallest modulus dollar that makes it so. It's a subtle but different question. Definitely. Now you mentioned this seems kind of irregular, but are there tools to get a handle on this? You brought up the Legendre symbol. Yes. And the big tool, especially for prime moduli, is the law of quadratic reciprocity. It's, well, quite remarkable. Remind us what it says. For two different odd primes, primey tip is month, it connects the Legendre symbol, pq, tippy. Specifically, p2 times q12 equals dollars raised to the power frac p12 times frac q12. So knowing if a power is a square mod calar tells you something about whether talar is a square mod p. Essentially, yes. It provides this unexpected link between seemingly independent modular systems. It's incredibly powerful for calculations and proofs. Okay. And going back to the size of the least non-residue modulo, a prime pail, let's call it mpo, what do we know about its size? Well, first, an interesting fact. 9p is always prime itself, except for p22, where it's not well defined, and 2, a3, where it is prime. That's cool. It is. And heuristically, you might think the chance of 1 being a residue is 1. The chance of 2 being a residue, given 1, might be roughly 12. The chance of 3 being a residue, given 1 and 2, are maybe 12 again? So the probability that the first calver primes are all residues might be like 12 calar. Sort of. That's the heuristic idea. It suggests that nmp might not grow too fast, maybe something like log 2 power. But what are the rigorous bounds? The best unconditional upper bound we have is from Burgess, which is roughly nmp is less than power 1, 1. It's less than 1, 5, 2. Roughly. Still potentially large, but
