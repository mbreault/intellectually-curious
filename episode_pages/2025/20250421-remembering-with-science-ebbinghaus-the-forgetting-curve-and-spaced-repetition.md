## Transcript

Welcome back to Science Corner Podcast. This is our series for intellectually curious amateur scientists. Glad to be back. Today we're taking a deep dive into something really fundamental, I think, to how we learn and remember. We're talking Hermann Ebbinghaus forgetting and this idea of spaced repetition. Yes, it's a fascinating journey into cognitive science. We'll be looking at how memory works, why we forget things, and importantly, a technique that really helps combat that forgetting. It's kind of amazing when you think about it that before Ebbinghaus, which was what, late 19th century? That's right. Before him, studying memory was mostly like philosophy, wasn't it? Absolutely. It relied heavily on introspection. And the general feeling, even among early psychologists like Blunt, was that memory was just too subjective, too internal for proper scientific study. Too messy, maybe. You could say that. The idea of applying rigorous quantitative methods like in physics or biology to something like remembering a list, that was quite radical. So enter Hermann Ebbinghaus, German psychologist, born 1850. He's the one who basically said, no, we can study this scientifically. Precisely. He's the pioneer who demonstrated that memory isn't just some vague philosophical concept, but a process we can actually measure, experiment on, and quantify. A real game changer. He essentially put memory on the scientific map. He did. He showed it operates according to discoverable principles, just like any other natural phenomenon, if you use the right methods. Okay, so that's our mission for this deep dive then. Let's unpack what he found, the forgetting curve, the spacing effect, and really figure out what it means for us, you know, trying to learn things effectively. Sounds good. Where should we start? With the man himself. Yeah, let's get a bit of background. Hermann Ebbinghaus, his early life wasn't all about memory research, was it? No, not at all. He was born into a merchant family, actually. His university studies started with history and philology before he focused on philosophy. Got his doctorate in 1873. And I read somewhere he even served in the Franco-Prussian War. Yes, that interrupted his studies for a bit around 1870. Adds another layer to his experience. So, philosophy, military service. What was the spark? What turned him towards memory? It seems the pivotal moment was finding a copy of Gustav Fechner's book, Elements of Psychophysics, probably in a secondhand bookshop in London. Fechner, he was the one applying math to perception. Exactly. Measuring sensations, finding mathematical relationships. Ebbinghaus saw that work and apparently had this aha moment. He thought, maybe, just maybe, you could apply that same quantitative rigor to higher mental processes like memory. Wow, a chance book discovery changing the course of psychology. That's pretty cool. It really is. It shows how ideas can cross-pollinate between fields. So, armed with this idea, he went back to Germany. Yes, he took a position at the University of Berlin. And that's where, around 1879, he started these incredibly meticulous experiments on himself. And he didn't just do research, he helped build the field, right? Setting up labs, journals. Absolutely. He founded one of the early psychology labs in Germany in 1886, co-founded a major journal. He was instrumental in establishing experimental psychology as a distinct discipline. Wasn't just a researcher. He was an institution builder. Which must have been tough challenging the idea that psychology was just, you know, a branch of philosophy using introspection. It was a huge challenge. The establishment view was deeply entrenched. His insistence on objective scientific methods was pushing against that tide, arguing psychology should be treated as a natural science. And his interests weren't only memory, though that's his main legacy. You mentioned other work. That's correct. He did research on color vision, for example. And later, while at Breslau, he developed something called the Ebbinghaus Completion Test. Oh, what was that? It was a task using word completion, like filling in missing letters or words designed to assess the intellectual abilities of schoolchildren. It shows his broader interest in applying empirical methods to different psychological questions. But the big one, the work that cemented his place in history, was his 1885 book, Ãœber das GedÃ¤chtnis. Memory. A contribution to experimental psychology, yes. That's the cornerstone. It's where he laid out everything, years of self-experimentation, his methods, his findings. The forgetting curve, spacing effect, it all came from that. That's where they were formally introduced, based on his data. The book had a massive impact, especially in the US, really kick-starting empirical memory research in a big way. Okay, so he showed it could be done. Let's get into the how. How did he actually measure memory without all the baggage of prior knowledge? This leads us to the famous nonsense syllables, right? Exactly. This was one of his most brilliant methodological moves. He realized if he used actual words or poems, people's existing knowledge, their associations would completely muddy the waters. You wouldn't know if they remembered it because of the experiment or because they already knew the word or it reminded them of something. Precisely. So he needed stimulus material that was ideally completely meaningless, neutral. And that led him to invent these consonant-vowel-consonant triplets, like Z-O-F or Q-A-X. Yes. He created a pool of about 2,300 of them. The idea was to have items that didn't have ready-made hooks in the mind, allowing him to study the formation of new memories more cleanly. But even he admitted they weren't perfectly meaningless, right? Some just sound more word-like or are easier to pronounce. That's a very important caveat. He acknowledged that himself, and later research confirmed it. Some syllables just stick better than others. There's what we call association value. And does focusing so much on meaningless stuff maybe skew the research away from how we remember things in real life? That's a valid critique, and it's been debated. For a while, it perhaps did push research towards more artificial lab tasks. It's that classic tension in science. Do you prioritize tight experimental control, or do you prioritize real-world relevance, what we call ecological validity? Ebbinghaus leaned towards control initially. Makes sense for establishing a new science. So he had these syllables. What did the actual experiments look like? What was he doing day after day? He used a procedure called serial learning. He'd make lists of these syllables, chosen randomly, and his task was to memorize them in the exact order they appeared. How did he present them? Very carefully. He read them aloud at a constant rapid rate, maybe 150 syllables per minute, using a metronome for timing, and keeping his voice inflection consistent. Highly controlled. Wow, that sounds intense and incredibly boring. He himself described it as a tiresome task, but it reflects his dedication to rigor. How did he know when he'd learned a list? What was the target? He used what's called learning to criterion. He kept repeating the list until he could recite it perfectly, in order, usually once or twice in a row without any mistakes. Okay, so the measure of learning difficulty was basically how many times he had to repeat the list to get it perfect. Exactly. The number of repetitions, or sometimes the total time taken, became his primary measure of the learning effort involved. And this was all him, right? He was the only subject in these foundational experiments. For the core studies reported in his 1885 book, yes. He was the experimenter and the participant. Which gives amazing control, I guess, but also raises questions about how generalizable it is to, well, everyone else. Absolutely, it's a limitation he was aware of. But doing it himself allowed him to control his routine, motivation, time of day variables that are harder to manage with multiple participants. He even replicated some experiments years later to check consistency. It shows incredible dedication. Okay, learning measured. But the really tricky part seems to be measuring forgetting. How do you quantify something that's gone? Right, just asking, do you remember, isn't very sensitive. You might not recall anything consciously, but maybe some trace is still there. This is where Ebbinghaus introduced another brilliant idea, the savings method. Savings? How did that work? Instead of asking what he remembered after, say, a day, he measured how much easier it was to relearn the exact same list back to the original criterion perfect recall. Ah, I see. So if it took him, say, 10 repetitions the first time, but only seven repetitions to relearn it 24 hours later. Then that meant three repetitions worth of effort had been saved. Some memory must have persisted, even if he couldn't actively recall the list before starting the relearning. So the savings is the difference in effort. Precisely. The formula is basically original effort, relearning effort, original effort times 100 to get a percentage. In your example, 10, 7, 10 equals 0.3, or 30% savings. That's really clever. It gives you a number, a quantitative measure of memory strength, even for stuff you can't consciously bring to mind. Exactly. It captured residual memory traces, hinting strongly at what we now call implicit memory. It was a much more sensitive measure of retention than simple recall or recognition. Some even argue today it's a purer measure of memory strength itself. Okay, so equipped with nonsense syllables, serial learning, and the savings method, Ebbinghaus could finally map out forgetting, which brings us to his most famous contribution probably, the forgetting curve. Yes, the forgetting curve. It's essentially a graph showing how memory retention declines over time if you don't make any effort to review the information. And the
