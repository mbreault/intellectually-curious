Welcome back to the Deep Dive. Today, we're diving into a forecasting method that's really crucial for navigating the complexities of modern supply chains. It's the Delphi method. And it's not just about collecting opinions. It's about harnessing collective intelligence, but doing it in a structured way. Right, right. You could think of it as a structured brainstorming session, but you know, like a supercharged one, you know. We're talking about carefully picking experts in relevant fields, you know, like your logistics or your data analytics people. And then having them offer their insights on a specific supply chain challenge. Okay, okay. So what makes it different from, you know, just a typical meeting or your typical brainstorming session? One key difference, one key difference is anonymity. The people taking part, they provide their forecasts without knowing who else is on the panel. And this really helps to get rid of bias and it encourages people to just say what they really think, even if it, you know, even if it goes against the grain, so to speak. That makes sense. That makes sense. Yeah, it takes the pressure off, you know, and it allows for, you know, more diverse perspectives to come out. But this isn't just a, you know, one and done survey, is it? Not at all. Not at all. It's an iterative process. So after that first round of forecasts, all the responses are summarized and then they're shared back with the panel, but still anonymously. This lets the experts see how their predictions stack up against the others and to, you know, maybe revise their own forecasts based on the collective wisdom. So it's about refining those predictions over several rounds to reach a more, you know, a more accurate and informed consensus. Exactly. Exactly. And by repeating this a few times, you can really, you know, neutralize the influence of those big personalities, the ones who might, you know, dominate the conversation and uncover the true collective wisdom. That's fascinating. Yeah, I can already see how valuable this could be, you know, for tackling those really complex supply chain challenges, especially now. It seems like disruption is the norm. Absolutely. Absolutely. And it's interesting, you know, that this method, I mean, it's used a lot today, but it actually comes from a Cold War strategy. Oh, really? I wouldn't have guessed that. Yeah. Yeah. The name Delphi, it actually refers back to the Oracle of Delphi, you know, the one from ancient Greece. But the method itself, that was developed during the Cold War, and it was to help predict the impact of all these new technologies on warfare. So they needed a way to make sense of this rapidly changing environment, much like, you know, much like we do in supply chains today. It seems like a pretty timeless approach to navigating all this uncertainty. It really is. It really is. And while it, you know, it started out in military strategy, its applications have, you know, really expanded over time a lot. Today, it's used in a bunch of different fields, including supply chain management, to tackle all sorts of challenges. So from your experience, where have you seen it applied most effectively in, you know, in the supply chain? One of the most common and impactful applications is in demand forecasting. So, you know, imagine you're trying to predict demand for a new product launch. By gathering forecasts from a panel of experts, you know, experts from across different functions, well, you can get a much more accurate picture of potential demand compared to traditional methods. That makes sense, especially when you consider how unpredictable consumer behavior can be these days. Exactly. Exactly. And there's data on this. A study in the materials you sent me showed that the Delphi method was able to predict new product sales with really impressive accuracy, like way better than traditional forecasting methods. Wow. So it's not just a theory. It's a proven technique with real-world results. Are there any specific examples, you know, that come to mind? Absolutely. Absolutely. I remember this case study. It involved a consumer electronics company and they were launching this new line of wearable tech and they were having trouble getting an accurate forecast, you know, using their usual methods. They decided to give the Delphi method a try. They put together this panel of experts from different departments, you know, marketing, sales, product development. They even brought in some external retail partners. So they tapped into a pretty broad range of perspectives to get that holistic view of the market. What happened? Well, the results were really remarkable. The Delphi method, it predicted sales within like a 3% to 4% margin of the actual sales figures, which was a huge improvement. Their forecasts from just historical data analysis, well, those were all over the place, really unreliable. That's a big improvement. And I imagine having that level of accuracy can translate into big cost savings and a more agile response to market fluctuations. You got it. You got it. Precisely. And that's just one example of how you can use the Delphi method for demand forecasting. It's also really effective for risk assessment, which is another key aspect of modern supply chain management. Oh, that's a great point. Risk is, well, it's everywhere these days. From your geopolitical events to your natural disasters. How can the Delphi method help companies mitigate those risks? Think of it as a stress test for your supply chain. You can get these experts together to pinpoint potential disruptions and then rank them based on how likely they are to happen and their potential impact. By understanding these vulnerabilities, well, you can develop proactive mitigation strategies. So you're shifting from a reactive approach to a more proactive one. So instead of just scrambling to put out fires, you're identifying potential hazards and then taking steps to prevent them from igniting in the first place. I can see how that would be a game changer in today's volatile business environment. Exactly. Exactly. And that's really just the start. This method, it can be used for all kinds of supply chain challenges. From evaluating those new technologies to developing sustainability strategies. This has been really insightful. I'm already starting to think about how I could apply the Delphi method to some of the challenges we're facing. But we've covered a lot already. Maybe we could take a quick pause here. And then in our next segment, we can come back and explore some of those more nuanced aspects of the Delphi method. Sounds good to me. There's a lot more to unpack. Welcome back. So before the break, we were talking about how the Delphi method can help companies stay ahead of those risks. And I wanted to emphasize that the Delphi method isn't like a one-size-fits-all solution. There are actually different variations of this technique. Each one's tailored to address specific types of problems. So there's a whole toolkit of Delphi methods to choose from. Tell me more. Exactly. Exactly. Like, for instance, you have something called the Policy Delphi. It's often used to explore really complex issues, the kind where there isn't just one clear answer. And where different stakeholders might have different opinions. It's not really about forecasting a specific outcome. It's more about understanding the in and outs of the challenge. And then working towards a shared understanding of the potential solutions. So if a company is trying to, say, decide on a new sustainability strategy. Or maybe they're trying to navigate a really complex regulatory landscape. The Policy Delphi could help them sort of map out a path forward. Precisely. Precisely. It's about bringing in all those different voices. Getting them to the table. And then facilitating a structured dialogue to identify potential roadblocks and opportunities. There's another interesting variation too. It's called the Argument Delphi. That one sounds particularly relevant. Especially in today's environment, you know. Where critical thinking is, well, it's more important than ever. It is. It is. The Argument Delphi, it kind of shifts the focus. It's not that much about consensus building. It's more about, you know, really dissecting the different arguments. And the reasoning, you know, the reasoning behind each perspective. It's about digging deeper, challenging assumptions. And really understanding, you know, the why behind the what. It's like you're doing like a forensic analysis of the issue. You know, getting to the root causes and the beliefs that shape, you know, all these different viewpoints. That's a great way to put it. And this can be really helpful when you're dealing with, you know, really controversial issues. Or when you need to be absolutely sure that all the potential risks and benefits are, you know, are thoroughly considered. Yeah, I'm starting to see how these variations can be, you know, could be applied strategically to all sorts of different supply chain challenges. Like, say, a company is evaluating a new technology. The Argument Delphi could help them weigh the pros and cons, you know, from all these different angles. Absolutely. And another thing to think about is that, you know, the Delphi method, it's been like significantly enhanced by technology. You know, we've moved beyond those paper questionnaires and the manual data analysis. Now there are all these online platforms, you know, they streamline the entire process. Oh, that makes sense. I mean, the digital revolution has, well, it's transformed so many aspects of supply chain management. So how have these platforms changed the way that the Delphi method is applied? Well, they've made it much more efficient and more accessible too. Now you can manage, you know, like a global panel of experts easily. These platforms, they take care of, you know, they take care of everything from sending out those questionnaires to, you know, to collect responses and then providing that feedback all in real time. So it's become much more, you know, agile and dynamic. And I'm guessing that also, you know, allows for better collaboration and faster results. Exactly, exactly. It's about, you know, it's about using the power of technology to enhance human intelligence. But while the Delphi method is a powerful tool, you know,
