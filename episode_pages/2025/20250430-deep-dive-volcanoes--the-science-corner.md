## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive and our Science Corner series. If you're one of our intellectually curious amateur scientists, today we're diving into something pretty spectacular and sometimes scary. The science of volcanoes. It's great to be here. Volcanoes really are a window into the Earth's core processes, a fascinating intersection of geology, chemistry, physics. Absolutely. We've got a lot of ground to cover, looking at what they are, the hazards, the different types, what comes out of them, and even what's erupting right now. So let's jump right in. Sounds good. Okay, let's start with the fundamentals. Beyond just a mountain that might explode, what is a volcano, scientifically speaking? Right. Well, at its most basic, it's an opening, a rupture in the Earth's crust. And through that opening, molten rock magma below ground, lava above plus gases and other debris can escape. An opening. But they don't just pop up anywhere, do they? There are specific places. Precisely. The vast majority are found where the Earth's tectonic plates meet. These massive slabs of rock are constantly moving. Right, the tectonic plates. So how does their movement actually cause a volcano? Two main ways, primarily. Where plates pull apart or diverge. Think of the mid-Atlantic ridge. Magma from the mantle rises to fill the gap. It's creating new crust there. Okay, like a seam splitting open. Exactly. Then where plates collide or converge, one plate usually slides under the other. That's called subduction. Subduction, I've heard that term. Yeah, and that process generates enormous heat and pressure. It melts the rock of the descending plate, creating magma which then forces its way up. That's how you get volcanic chains like the Pacific Ring of Fire. It's famous for a reason. Ring of Fire, definitely. So pulling apart lets magma up. Crashing together melts rock that comes up. What about where plates just slide past each other, like the San Andreas Fault? Ah, good question. Generally, you don't get major volcanism there. That sliding motion, the transform boundary, doesn't typically create the right conditions for large-scale melting needed for volcanoes. Okay, that makes sense. But then, aren't there volcanoes not on plate edges? Like Hawaii, it's stuck right in the middle of a plate. You're absolutely right. And that's where things get really interesting. It's called intra-plate volcanism. Volcanism within a plate. Intra-plate, how does that work? Two key mechanisms. Sometimes the crust within a plate gets stretched and thinned out. Think of the East African Rift or even parts of the Western US, like the Rio Grande Rift. This thinning can allow magma to push through. So weak spots in the crust. Sort of, yes. The other big one is mantle plumes or hotspots. These are thought to be columns of unusually hot rock rising from deep within the Earth, maybe even the core mantle boundary. Hotspots, like a blowtorch under the plate. That's a pretty good analogy. The plate moves over this relatively fixed hotspot and pop, pop, pop, you get a chain of volcanoes. Hawaii is the classic example of that. Fascinating. So different plumbing systems depending on the geology. Now, obviously eruptions can be spectacular, but they're also dangerous. What are the main hazards we need to think about? The hazards are significant and they vary. First, the immediate obvious ones. Lava flows and debris flows, which are called the HAARS. These aren't always slow moving like you might picture. Not slow. No, they can travel incredibly fast sometimes. Debris flows especially can reach speeds up to, well, 100 miles per hour in some cases. They just destroy everything in their path. Wow, 100 miles per hour, that's devastating. It is, but the danger often extends much, much further. Think about volcanic ash. Right, the fine powdery stuff. Exactly, tiny pulverized rock and glass. It can be blasted high into the atmosphere and carried for hundreds, even thousands of miles. And that's bad because? Multiple reasons. It's a major health hazard if inhaled. It can contaminate water supplies. It's abrasive, so it damages machinery, buildings. It reduces visibility to near zero sometimes. And I remember hearing it's a huge problem for airplanes. Oh, absolutely critical. Jet engines operate at incredibly high temperatures. If they ingest that fine ash, it melts inside the engine and then solidifies on cooler parts like turbine blades. So it basically clogs up the engine. It can cause the engines to lose power or even fail completely. That's why airspace is shut down for hundreds of miles around significant eruptions. It's just too dangerous. Makes sense. And these big eruptions, they can even affect the whole planet's climate, can't they? I've read about volcanic winters. That's correct. Really large eruptions can inject huge amounts of ash and sulfur dioxide gas way up into the stratosphere. Way above the weather. Right. And up there, these particles, especially the sulfur dioxide converting to sulfate aerosols, act like tiny mirrors. They reflect sunlight back into space. So it cools the surface down. Yes, it leads to a cooling effect in the lower atmosphere, the troposphere where we live. At the same time, they can absorb heat radiating from Earth, causing the stratosphere itself to warm up a bit. But the surface cooling is the main effect linked to those historical volcanic winters, which sometimes led to crop failures and famine. Incredible. A single event shaping global climate. Okay, let's shift gears a bit. We tend to picture volcanoes as, you know, cone-shaped mountains. But they're not all the same, are they? Not at all. Geologists classify them into four main types, based largely on their shape and how they erupt. You've got shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes, cinder cones, and lava domes. Each has a distinct sort of personality. Personalities, I like that. Let's start with shield volcanoes. The name sounds defensive. Well, it actually refers to the shape. They're huge, but very broad with gentle slopes. Think of a warrior shield lying flat on the ground. Ah, okay. Why so flat? It's all about the lava. Shield volcanoes erupt very fluid, runny lava, low viscosity. Because it flows so easily, it travels long distances before cooling, building up those wide, gentle slopes layer by layer over many eruptions. Low viscosity. Runny lava. What kind of rock does that make? It's typically low in silica, maybe around 50%. This makes basalt, which is often rich in sodium, potassium, aluminum. The classic examples are the Hawaiian volcanoes like Mauna Loa and Kilauea, or the ones in the Galapagos. Got it. Big, broad, runny lava. So next up, stratovolcanoes. That sounds more pointy. They definitely are. They're also called composite volcanoes. Think of the classic picture postcard volcano shapes, steep slopes, often symmetrical cones, like Mount Fuji or Mount St. Helens. Composite, meaning made of different things. Exactly. They're built up from alternating layers, or strata, of both lava flows and fragmental material, ash, cinders, blocks from more explosive eruptions. Ah, so they have explosive eruptions and lava flows. Yes. Their lava is generally thicker, more viscous than shield volcano lava. It has intermediate silica content, maybe 60-64%. Thicker lava. Does that mean it traps gas? Precisely. Higher viscosity makes it harder for dissolved gases to escape peacefully. So pressure builds up and can lead to those much more explosive eruptions we associate with stratovolcanoes. The typical rock type is andesite. Think Krakatoa, Vesuvius. Historically significant and dangerous ones. Right, the famous ones. Okay, third type, cinder cones. They sound smaller. They generally are much smaller than shields or stratovolcanoes. They're basically steep, conical hills made almost entirely of tephra. That's the fragmented stuff. Like cinders or ash ejected during mildly explosive eruptions. They often have a bowl-shaped crater at the top. So just piles of volcanic debris. Pretty much. What's interesting is you often find them on the flanks, the sides of larger volcanoes, or sometimes in clusters, almost like little parasitic cones. Do they have lava flows too? Often, yes. The eruption might start with that explosive fountain of cinders driven by gas, but then finish with a quieter phase where lava oozes out from the base. The magma viscosity is usually intermediate to highish, making rocks like dacite or andesite. You see them in places like Lava Butte in Oregon or Mount Fox in Australia. Okay, and the last one, lava domes. Lava domes. These are often formed after an explosive eruption, sometimes right inside the crater of a larger stratovolcano. They're basically mounds of very, very thick, viscous lava. Oh, thick it can't really flow. Exactly. It just slowly oozes out and piles up around the vent, creating this rough, dome-like or bulbous shape. Think toothpaste, but rock. Rock toothpaste. What makes it so thick? Extremely high silica content. We're talking 68-77% silica. This makes the lava incredibly viscous, resistant to flow. The rock type is typically rhyolite. Mount St. Helens has a famous lava dome that grew inside its crater after the 1980 eruption. The Mono Inyo craters in California are another example. So four types, four personalities, driven by lava viscosity. Let's dig into that a bit more. Viscosity is just resistance to flow, right? That's the essence of it, yes. Like you said earlier, think water versus honey or cake batter. Lava viscosity is crucial. Low viscosity, like in Hawaii, lets gas escape easily, gives you those
