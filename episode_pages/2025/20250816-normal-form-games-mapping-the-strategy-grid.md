## Description

We unpack normal form gamesâ€”the grid-based tool for modeling strategic choices. Learn to read payoff matrices, spot dominated strategies, and identify Nash equilibria, with classics like the Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma. Weâ€™ll also compare simultaneous versus sequential moves and connect the math to real-world decision making.

## Transcript

All right, let's unpack something truly fascinating today. Ever tried to figure out what someone else will do when your choices affect each other, like in business or even just deciding where to go for dinner? Yeah, those strategic interactions are everywhere. Exactly. So today we're doing a deep dive into normal form games. It's a core idea in game theory and honestly a really powerful way to look at these situations. That's right. Normal form, it's a specific way to describe a game. Think less like a branching tree diagram and more like a grid, a matrix. It's basically a big table and it's super useful for quickly spotting things like strictly dominated strategies or Nash equilibria. Nash equilibria, right. We'll get to that. We will. Now you do lose some info compared to say an extensive form game, like the exact sequence of moves isn't immediately obvious. But you gain that big picture view. Precisely. A full snapshot of all the strategies and all the possible outcomes laid out clearly. So for you listening, think of it like this. The normal form grid shows you every single possible plan of action for every player involved. And really importantly, it shows the exact payoff, what each player gets, their score or utility for every single combination of those plans. It's like seeing the whole strategic landscape at once. Yeah, exactly. So the key bits are the player's strategy spaces. That's just the complete set of all possible strategies available to them. Their menu of choices? Kinda, yeah, but more comprehensive. A strategy isn't just one move, it's a full plan. Like if they do this, then I'll do that, covering all possibilities. Okay, a complete plan. Right. And then you have the payoff functions. These just connect a specific set of chosen strategies, one from each player, called a strategy profile, to each player's outcome. Usually a number representing how much they value that outcome. Let's make that concrete. You mentioned a matrix. Yeah, imagine a simple one. Two players. Player one chooses the row, say top or bottom. Player two chooses the column, left or right. Okay, like a grid. Exactly. And inside each box or cell of that grid, there are two numbers. The first number is the payoff for player one, the row player. And the second is for player two, the column player. You got it. So if the cell for top left has 4, 3, it means if player one picks top and player two picks left, player one gets a payoff of 4 and player two gets 3. Simple as that. Got it. Clear. And here's where it gets really interesting, right? Using this to find strategies that just don't make sense. Dominated strategies, yeah. This is where the matrix shines. The classic example is the prisoner's dilemma, isn't it? It really is. Perfect illustration. You've got two suspects, right? Held separately. They can cooperate with each other by staying silent or defect by ratting the other one out. And their choice affects their jail time, but also the other person's. Exactly. And when you lay out those choices and payoffs in the normal form matrix, something becomes really clear. What's that? Defect strictly dominates cooperate for both of them. Meaning no matter what the other prisoner does, each individual prisoner is better off defecting. Always. How does the matrix show that? Well, look at the payoffs. For, say, the row player. Yeah. If the other guy cooperates, defecting might get you 0 years instead of minus 1. If the other guy defects, defecting gets you maybe minus 5 years instead of minus 10. The numbers might vary, but the logic holds. 0 is better than minus 1, and minus 5 is better than minus 10. So defecting always gives you a better personal outcome, regardless of their choice. Precisely. And since it's true for both players, they both end up defecting. That defect outcome, that's the unique Nash equilibrium, even though they'd both be better off if they both cooperated. Fascinating. Seems counterintuitive for the group, but totally logical for the individual. Now hang on, you said the sequence isn't obvious. Does this matrix thing only work for simultaneous moves? Good question. Not necessarily. You can represent sequential games in normal form, too. It just gets a bit more complex. How so? How do you capture the, if they do this first, then I do that part? You have to define the strategies very carefully. For the player who moves second, a strategy isn't just their basic action, like left or right. It's more conditional. Exactly. It has to be a complete plan covering every possible move the first player could have made. So player 2 might have strategies like play left if player 1 played top, and play right if player 1 played bottom. Ah, okay. So even contingencies that might not happen based on the actual path taken have to be included in the strategy definition. Right. Player 2 might end up having four or more strategies in the matrix, even if they only have two basic actions available at their turn. It captures all the conditional logic. So wrapping this up then, what's the big takeaway for you, the listener? Well, normal form games give you this really structured, clear way to analyze situations where people's choices interact. Yeah, laying out all the choices, all the outcomes, it lets you see the whole strategic picture, maybe spot things you wouldn't otherwise notice. Definitely. It helps you dissect complex interactions. You start to understand not just what might happen, but why, based on the incentives shown in those payoffs. It really sharpens your critical thinking about decisions. So here's a final thought to leave you with. Think about a recent decision you made, maybe even a simple negotiation or interaction. How might framing it as a game, thinking about the players, their strategies, their potential payoffs, change how you understand it? Could it reveal new insights for your own choices next time?
