## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. As always, we're diving deep into the world of math. And today, we're going even deeper into a specific sequence from the OEIS A000169 to be exact. So this sequence accounts the number of labeled rooted trees with n nodes. And the formula for this sequence is surprisingly simple. It's an equals n to the power of n minus 1. So a nice clean formula there. Yeah, exactly. But it turns out this simple formula, it actually shows up in a bunch of different areas of math. It does. So today we're really going to try and understand why this formula is so important. And we're going to explore some of these connections that it has. I think that's a great goal. Yeah, so I guess maybe just to start things off, can you maybe give us like a super clear definition of a labeled rooted tree? So we're all on the same page. A labeled rooted tree on n nodes, it's basically a tree, which means it's a connected graph with no cycles. But the key here is that each of the n nodes, it has a unique label. So you could label them from 1 to n, for example. Okay, so like the nodes are distinguishable. Yeah, exactly. They're not all the same. Gotcha. And one specific node is chosen as the root of the tree. Okay, so there's like a special node. There is a special node. Gotcha, that makes sense. And so let's look at like the first few terms of the sequence just to get a feel for it. Okay. So for n equals 1, we just have a single node. Right. And that's also the root. Yes. And that's just one possibility. One possibility. And if we plug that into the formula, 1 to the power of 1 minus 1, that's 1 to the power of 0, which is just 1. Yeah. So it matches. It matches the formula. Exactly. Right. Now what about for n equals 2? What do these trees look like? For n equals 2, we've got two labeled nodes. Okay, let's just call them. We can call them 1 and 2. 1 and 2. So we can have 1 as the root with 2 as its child. That's okay. Or we can have 2 as the root and 1 as its child. Gotcha. And those are different? They are different because the root is different. And also because the labels are different. Okay, so that gives us two labeled rooted trees. Exactly. Two possibilities. Okay, and 2 to the power of 2 minus 1 is 2 to the power of 1, which is 2. Which is 2. So again, it matches the sequence. It matches. Okay, cool. So now for n equals 3, things get a little bit more complicated. They do get a bit more complicated, yeah. But the sequence tells us there should be 9 of these trees. That's right, 3 squared. Yeah, 3 to the power of 2, which is 9. But it's a little bit hard to visualize all of those different trees. It's a little harder to just draw them all out. Yeah, so can you maybe talk about like what kind of structures we would be seeing there? Yeah, so let's think about it. We've got our 3 nodes. Okay, labeled 1, 2, and 3. 1, 2, and 3. And one thing we could do is we could have one node be the root. Okay, and then the other two. And then the other two would be its children hanging off of it. Gotcha. And because the children are labeled. There are actually 3 choices for which one is the root. Okay, because we could pick any of the 3 to be the root. Exactly. And then once we've chosen the root, there's only one way to arrange the two children. Okay, because they're labeled. They're labeled. So that gives us 3 trees right there. Okay, 3 trees where the root has 2 children. Right, but there's another way we could do it. Okay. We could have the root. We could have a root with one child. Okay, and then that child has another child. And then that child has the third node as its child. Okay, so it's like a chain. It's like a little chain, yeah. Gotcha. So in this case, again, we have 3 choices for the root. 3 choices for the root because it could be any of the 3 nodes. Okay, and then once we've chosen the root, there are 2 choices for like the middle node. 2 choices for who gets to be the root's child. Yeah. Exactly. The last node is just the grandchild. Okay, so that gives us 3 times 2. 3 times 2. Which is 6 trees. Okay, so 6 trees that look like that. Right, and if we add those 2 cases together, 3 plus 6. Yeah, that gives us our 9. We get our 9 labeled rooted trees. Okay. For n equals 3? For n equals 3. So we've got our 9 trees. Okay, that's really cool. So it's interesting that like the labels are really important here. Yeah, they really make a difference. Because we didn't have the labels. If we didn't care about the labels, some of those structures would actually be the same. Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So I guess like the main point here is that this formula, n to the n minus 1, it really does count these labeled rooted trees. It does, that's its main job. Yeah, but it turns out that's not all it does. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Yeah, like you were saying before, this sequence shows up in a lot of surprising places. It really does, it's a bit of a celebrity in the math world. So what are some of these other places where it shows up? Well, one example is these things called connected transitive subtree acyclic digraphs. Wow, that's a mouthful. It is a bit of a mouthful, but it's a really cool concept. Okay, so what exactly is a digraph? A digraph is like a regular graph, but the edges have a direction. Okay, so they're like arrows? Like arrows. Instead of just lines. Exactly. And acyclic means that there are no directed cycles. Okay, so you can't follow the arrows around in a loop. Gotcha. And transitive means that if there's an arrow from A to B. Okay. And an arrow from B to C. And another one from B to C, then there must also be an arrow from A to C. Okay, so it's like... It's like a shortcut, yeah. Gotcha. So this whole thing connected transitive subtree acyclic digraphs. Right. It sounds very different. It sounds very different from counting labeled trees. It does sound different on the surface. Yeah. So how are they related? Well, it turns out that there's a way to match them up. Okay, like a one-to-one correspondence. Exactly. It's called a bijection. Okay. And I don't think we need to go into all the details of the bijection. No, I don't think we need to get into the nitty-gritty. Yeah. But the fact that it exists... The fact that it exists is really important. Okay. Because it means that... It tells us that these two seemingly different things, they actually have the same underlying structure. Okay. They're just encoded in a different way. So it's like two different ways of representing the same information. Okay. That's really cool. And they both happen to be counted by this n to the n minus 1 formula. Gotcha. So it's like they both have this... They both have this same essence. Yeah, this same mathematical essence. Yeah, exactly. Okay. That's really fascinating. So the OEIS also mentions that, this n to the n minus 1, it also counts the number of functions from the set 1, 2 up to n. Right. To itself. Yeah. Such that the sum of the function values is congruent to k modulo n. For any given integer k. For any k that you choose. Okay. So how do functions even fit into this picture? This one is really cool because it brings in some algebra. Okay. Along with our combinatorics. So imagine we've got our n elements. Okay. And we think of them as nodes in a graph. Okay. So for each i from 1 to n, our function f, it takes i and it maps it to f of i. Okay. So we can think of that as... And we can visualize that as an arrow in our graph. In a graph going from i to f of i. Gotcha. So we've got all these arrows. We've got all these arrows representing our function. Okay. And it turns out that if you look at the big picture, this collection of arrows, it breaks down into a bunch of connected components. Okay. In each component. In each of these components. It's basically a cycle. Okay. With some trees attached to it. So imagine like a loop and then some trees kind of hanging off of the loop. Okay. Pointing towards the loop. Gotcha. And the condition. And the cool thing is the condition about the sum of the function values modulo n. It actually tells us something about the properties of these cycles and trees. Okay. So it's like a hidden connection between modular arithmetic and the structure of these graphs. Okay. That's really cool. Yeah. And if you count carefully, the number of functions that satisfy this condition, you get n to the n minus 1. Wow.
