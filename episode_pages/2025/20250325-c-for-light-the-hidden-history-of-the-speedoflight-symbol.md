## Transcript

Welcome back to Science Quarter Podcast for all you science fans out there who love digging a little deeper, you know, getting to the bottom of things. Today we're tackling something so familiar you might not even think twice about it. But trust me, there's a lot more to it than meets the eye. We're talking about that little letter C. Yep, the one that stands for the speed of light. It's one of those symbols, right? You see it everywhere in physics. E equals MC OO. But have you ever stopped to wonder why C? Why not, I don't know, S for speed or L for light? Exactly. It's so fundamental to our understanding of, well, everything, that we kind of take it for granted. So today we're going on a deep dive, a historical expedition, if you will, to uncover how Ls came to be the symbol for the speed of light. And I think you'll find it's way more interesting than you might expect. Oh, absolutely. It wasn't always a straightforward path. There were twists and turns, competing symbols, and some of the biggest names in physics wrestling with how to represent this cornerstone concept. All right, so let's set the stage. Let's go back to the 19th century, a time of huge breakthroughs in understanding electricity, magnetism, and light. A time when scientists were really starting to see these connections between what seemed like separate forces. And you know what? Maybe surprisingly, our familiar little C wasn't the go-to symbol back then. Right. It was all about the uppercase V. And the person we really need to thank for that is James Clerk Maxwell. Brilliant guy, laid the groundwork for so much of modern physics. He unified electricity and magnetism, and from about 1865 onward, he used V for the speed of light in all his equations. So Maxwell is using V. And his work was so influential, his 1873 treatise, it basically became the Bible of classical physics. So I'm guessing that pretty much locked V in as the standard, at least for a while. Yeah, you could say that. Even as we move into the 20th century, the early 1900s, that convention was still pretty strong. Which is kind of wild to think about, because this is the time when Einstein's coming onto the scene, right? Special relativity, completely changing our understanding of space and time. And he was initially using V for the speed of light, too. Yep. In those early groundbreaking papers, it's V right there in the equations. It almost feels, well, out of place now, doesn't it? It really does. It's like seeing a typewriter in a spaceship. But hold on, V wasn't the only symbol in the running, was it? There's this other lowercase c popping up around the same time. Exactly. And this is where the story takes an interesting turn. We need to rewind a bit, go back to 1856, to the work of two German physicists, Wilhelm Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch. They were diving deep into electrodynamics, figuring out the forces at play between electric charges. And in their work, they introduced a quantity that they also decided to call C. So this C, was it meant to be the speed of light right from the start? Not exactly. Weber actually called his C a constant. It was a specific relative speed between electric charges that factored into their force law. It was more about describing how these charges interact, not about light zipping through space. Okay, a constant. So where's the connection to the speed of light then? Ah, that's the really cool part. It turns out that Weber's constant, the C, was later found to be related to the speed of light. In fact, it was equal to the speed of light multiplied by the square root of 2. Wait, hold on. So they stumble upon this number, this C, that's basically the speed of light in disguise. And they're calling it a constant in their force law. It's like the universe was already hinting at this connection between electricity and light, even before they fully grasped it. I know, right? It's like one of those clues in a mystery novel that seems insignificant at first, but then turns out to be hugely important. And now fast forward a few decades to Paul Druve, another big name in physics. He enters the scene around 1894, and he kind of bridges this gap between Weber's C and the speed of light as we know it. Okay, so how does Druve fit into all of this? Well, he starts using C to represent the speed of electrodynamic waves. He's looking at how these waves, including light, propagate through space. But here's the catch. When he's specifically working on optics, he still sticks with Maxwell's V for the speed of light. Hold on. So Druve's using C for electromagnetic waves in general, but V when talking about light specifically. It sounds like things were getting pretty messy symbol-wise. It must have been confusing, yeah. Two different symbols for what we now know is basically the same thing. And to add another layer to this, there's the question of where C itself came from. Weber called it a constant, right? But could there be more to it? I think I see where you're going with this. Like, was he thinking constant? Or was there this subconscious link to celeritas, the Latin word for speed, already floating around in the back of his mind? Exactly, because C has this history, you know. It was used to denote speed, celeritas, even in earlier scientific texts going back centuries. So even if Weber wasn't consciously thinking about that, it's entirely possible that this pre-existing association influenced its later adoption for the speed of light. It's like the symbol itself had a predisposition towards representing speed. Okay, so we've got V from Maxwell and the C with its mysterious origins floating around. How did we get from there to C being the undisputed champion, the symbol everyone uses for the speed of light? It was a gradual process, a sort of scientific consensus that emerged over time. And some key figures in this shift were Max Planck and Hendrik Lorenz, both huge names in physics, especially in the German-speaking scientific community. What were they doing differently with C? Well, Planck, for example, started using C pretty early on, even back in 1899, when he introduced what we now call Planck units, you know, the fundamental units based on those incredibly tiny constants that govern the universe at the quantum level. And right there next to the gravitational constant and Planck's constant was C, representing the speed of light. Using it like that to define the very fabric of reality, that must have given C some serious weight in the scientific community. Oh, definitely. It's like saying, hey, the C is one of the fundamental building blocks of the universe. And then there's Lorenz. He had a bit of a journey with his notation. Started with an A in 1887, then switched to Maxwell's V. But by 1903, he was on Team C as well. Even Max Abraham, another prominent physicist, had adopted C by 1902. So you have all these heavy hitters in physics basically saying, yep, C is the way to go. And it seems like this was primarily happening in the German-speaking scientific world. Yeah, you could say that. By 1907, C was pretty much the standard in German physics. And who else was working in Germany at the time? Einstein. I see where you're going with this. But didn't he start with V? What did he make the switch? He switched over to C in 1907. And get this, it was in a paper for the Jahrbuch der RadioaktivitÃ¤t und Elektronik. This paper, it's kind of a big deal because it's the first time E equals MC smile appears in print. Wow, talk about timing. So at the very moment when his theory of relativity was taking its most iconic form, that V became inextricably linked to it. No wonder it stuck. Right. It's like the perfect storm for C to become the standard. And while Einstein didn't explicitly explain the switch, there are some pretty good reasons why he might have done it. Yeah, I was going to ask about that. Do we know why he made the change? Well, think about those relativity equations. They can get pretty complicated, right? And in those equations, you've got uppercase V for the speed of light and lowercase V for the velocity of an object. It's easy to mix those up, especially if you're scribbling notes or working through a long derivation. Switching to C just makes everything clearer. It's more distinct. That makes sense. Precision is everything in physics. And on top of that, C was already becoming the standard in German physics, thanks to those guys we talked about, like Drued, Planck, and Lorentz. Einstein was right there in the thick of it, so adopting the prevailing convention just makes sense. Exactly. It streamlines communication, makes his work easier to understand and integrate with everything else that was going on. It's a practical choice as much as anything else. Okay, so C is gaining ground in Germany. But I'm guessing the rest of the world wasn't exactly on the same page. You're right. Over in England and France, they had a different favorite, lowercase V. Lowercase V. But isn't that just velocity? Like the speed and direction of any object? It is, yeah. But back then, they were using it specifically for what they called the electromagnetic constant. And they knew that this constant was directly related to the speed of light. So it was essentially the same thing, just a different symbol. Okay, so why V? What's the story there? You can actually trace that back to Maxwell, meticulous guy that he was. In his 1873 treatise, he actually included a table comparing direct measurements
