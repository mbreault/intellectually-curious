## Description

A practical, deep-dive into Material Requirements Planning (MRP). We break down what MRP is, how it uses the BOM, the difference between independent and dependent demand, and the data and outputs that drive production and purchasing schedules. We also trace its evolutionâ€”from early computerized systems to Orlickyâ€™s 1964 breakthrough and todayâ€™s software-driven planningâ€” contextualized for modern supply chain professionals.

## Transcript

Welcome back to the deep dive, everybody. Today we're going to be digging into something that's pretty fundamental, I think it's safe to say, for modern supply chain management. Yeah, for sure. Especially for those of you out there who are really looking to get a really solid handle on the core planning processes. We're talking about material requirements planning or, you know, MRP. Right. MRP, we hear that a lot. And, you know, we've gone through a lot of the, you know, the really essential knowledge out there. And we're going to be talking about all the, you know, the fundamental principles, how it's evolved over time and why it's still so important, you know, in today's world of manufacturing. Absolutely. So the goal here, I think, in this deep dive is to, you know, make sure that you come away with a really good understanding of what MRP is all about, how it works, you know, and why it just it's so important in the supply chain world, all while keeping it, you know, nice and straightforward. Yeah, we want to make it digestible. Exactly. Exactly. So I think a good place to start is, you know, just right off the bat. What exactly is material requirements planning? Yeah. So at its core, you can think of MRP as this system for production planning, scheduling and inventory control. Okay. Really widely used in manufacturing. And while nowadays, you know, most of the MRP systems you see are software based, just because there's so much data and it's so complex. Right. The underlying principles could actually be applied manually, although that would be a pretty big task, you know? Yeah, I can imagine. In today's world, especially. Yeah. So thinking about that, then what are like the main goals of MRP? What's it really trying to achieve for supply chain professionals? So there are three primary objectives that you want to keep in mind. The first one, and this is probably the most relevant for supply chain performance, is ensuring that you have all the materials you need, you know, the raw materials to actually make the products and then also making sure that you have enough finished goods available when your customers want them. Right. Makes sense. Second is it tries to keep those inventory levels as low as possible, which is, you know, super important for efficiency in any supply chain. Oh, yeah, for sure. Efficiency is key. Absolutely. And the third one is it really meticulously plans all those activities that are all linked together. Manufacturing, delivery, purchasing, you know, the whole nine yards. Yeah. And of course, these objectives, you know, they often involve some trade-offs, especially in today's kind of volatile, crazy markets. Oh, yeah. Where you're trying to keep inventory low, but also make sure you have enough. It's a balancing act. Yeah. Finding that sweet spot can be tough. So we hear about dependent and independent demand a lot. Can you break down what that means in the context of MRP? Sure. So independent demand is basically the demand for the finished goods that starts outside of your production system. It's what your customers are actually buying. Gotcha. Dependent demand, on the other hand, is the demand for everything that goes into making those finished goods. The components, the sub-assemblies, the raw materials. And it's directly tied to how much of the final product you're planning to make. Now, this is where the bill of materials or BALM comes in. This is like the blueprint that lists out every single part, every nut and bolt, and how much of each you need to build one unit of your final product. Okay, so the BALM is kind of like the master recipe, right? Listing every ingredient needed to make the finished product. Yeah, exactly. And MRP uses that recipe to calculate exactly what you need and when, based on how much of the final product you're expecting to sell. Makes sense. So MRP uses that to figure out, okay, we need this many of these components by this date, that sort of thing. Precisely. And from these kind of foundational concepts, we get the core functions of an MRP system. So things like managing those inventory levels for both raw materials and finished goods. Processing those BALMs to actually figure out the component requirements. And then doing the basic scheduling for production runs and for when we need to order more stuff from suppliers. Okay, so we've talked about what MRP is and why it's important, but what about the how? What kind of information does it need to actually do its thing to generate those plans and schedules? So it actually needs quite a bit of data. And it needs to be pretty detailed and accurate. First off, it needs to know what you're making, right? The end product, the top level item in your bill of materials. Okay, the final product, the thing that the customer is actually going to buy. Exactly. It also needs to know how much of that product you need to make and when you need it done by. Right, got to hit those deadlines. Of course. Yeah. And if there are any shelf life limitations for either the raw materials or the finished product, it needs to know that too. Oh yeah, makes sense. Especially for things like food products or anything that's perishable. For sure. Then you need really accurate inventory records. That means knowing what you have on hand right now and what's already been ordered but hasn't arrived yet. So real-time visibility into your inventory levels. Absolutely. And we've already talked about how important the BOM is. It needs all that detailed information about the components and how they fit together. And finally, it needs what we call planning data. This covers things like how the product actually gets made, you know, the step-by-step process, how long each step takes, and what kind of labor and machine hours are involved. Okay, so like the standard operating procedures for each step in the process. Exactly. It also needs to know about your quality control standards, how you handle things like ordering in bulk or just in time, how much scrap or waste you expect to have at each stage of production, and even whether you're using a push or pull system for different parts of the operation. Wow, so a lot of very granular data goes into it. So what do you get out of it? What are the key outputs that supply chain professionals use? So the two main things that come out of an MRP system are what we call the recommended production schedule and the recommended purchasing schedule. The production schedule is a super detailed plan that tells you when to start and finish each step of the manufacturing process and how much to make at each step. So basically a roadmap for the entire production process broken down step by step. Exactly. And it's all based on your overall production targets, which are set in the master production schedule and, of course, that all-important bill of materials. Got it. So the MPS sets the overall targets and the production schedule breaks it down into those manageable steps using the BOM as the guide. Precisely. Now the purchasing schedule, on the other hand, tells you when you need to have purchased items delivered to your facility to keep production running smoothly and also when you need to actually place those orders with your suppliers to make sure they get there on time. That's super important for keeping everything synchronized. So you have to have those materials on hand when you need them, not too early and definitely not too late. Exactly. These schedules are like the conductors of your supply chain orchestra making sure everyone's playing in sync. I like that analogy. So beyond these schedules, are there any other outputs that supply chain teams might rely on? Yes, there are some really important supporting messages and reports that come out of MRP. Okay. For instance, the actual purchase orders that get sent to suppliers are generated by the system. Right. Makes sense. That would be automated. Uh-huh. And then you have what are called reschedule notices. These are super useful for managing a dynamic supply chain because they recommend changes to existing orders, you know, whether it's canceling, increasing, delaying, or speeding things up. Ah, so it's not a static plan. MRP can adapt to changes in demand, lead times, or unexpected events and suggest adjustments to the plan. Exactly. You got it. It's about staying agile. That's really interesting. It makes you wonder, how did businesses even function before MRP came along? I mean, it seems so essential now. Well, before MRP became widely adopted, companies were relying on much simpler inventory management techniques. Things like reorder point and reorder quantity methods, which were really just based on historical demand patterns. So more reactive than proactive, I guess. Just waiting until inventory got low and then placing an order. Yeah, pretty much. And they didn't really consider how demand for different items within the production process was interconnected. So when did computers start to change all of this? Well, believe it or not, the very first computerized MRP systems actually popped up way back in the 1950s. Wow, that early. Yeah. Companies like Rolls-Royce and General Electric, they were doing some pretty innovative stuff back then. But these early systems, they weren't really commercially available. Interesting. So who do we have to thank for the MRP systems we know and love today? Most people credit Joseph Orlicky with really developing and popularizing modern MRP in 1964. He was heavily influenced by the Toyota Manufacturing Program and the needs of the U.S. Navy's Polaris Program. And fun fact, Black & Decker was the very first company to actually implement an MRP system that same year. Wow, so 1964 was a big year for MRP. And wasn't there a book that really cemented its place in the industry? Yes. Orlicky wrote a book called Material Requirements Planning in 1975. And the subtitle was The New Way of
