## Description

In this episode we explore OEIS sequence A000178, the superfactorial. We define it in two equivalent ways: as the product 1! · 2! · 3! · ... · n! and as the product 1^n · 2^{n-1} · 3^{n-2} · ... · n^1, noting that the case n = 0 yields 1. We look at the first terms 1, 1, 2, 12, 288, 34560 and touch on older indexing names like M2049 and N0A11. The discussion then dives into deep connections across math: its appearance as a Vandermonde determinant (the determinant of the matrix with entries i^j for i = 1..n+1 and j = 0..n equals the superfactorial), and related determinant formulations involving Lucas sequences; odd-indexed superfactorials arising as Hankel transforms of tangent numbers; determinant representations tied to Lucas-based matrices; a link to graph theory via the multiplicative Wiener index of a path graph; the striking fact that, except for n = 0 and 1, superfactorials are never perfect squares; and the Barnes G function with A_n = G(n+2), plus asymptotics related to the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant. We’ll also reflect on how these diverse threads illustrate the rich interconnectedness of algebra, combinatorics, and number theory in the OEIS landscape.

## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. As you know, we've been taking a pretty deep look into the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. For all of our listeners who are studying number theory out there, this is just an incredible resource. It is. So for today's episode, we're diving into a particularly fascinating entry. Okay. That is OEIS sequence A000178. Right. Better known as the superfactorial. The superfactorials. The superfactorials. Yeah. The name itself kind of hints at something a little more than just factorial. Right. So for those of us who might be encountering this for the first time, what exactly is a superfactorial? Well, in simple terms, the superfactorial of a number n is the product of the first n factorials. Okay. So that's 1 factorial times 2 factorial times 3 factorials and so on up to n factorial. Okay. So a product of factorials? Is there another way to think about this? Yes, there's a really cool alternative definition. You can express the superfactorial of n as the product of powers. Okay. So it would be 1 to the n times 2 to the n minus 1 times 3 to the n minus 2 and so on up to n to the power of 1. I see. Same result. Okay. Just a different way of building it. Right. And just to cover all the bases. Okay. The superfactorial of 0 is defined as 1. Makes sense. Yeah. That product of powers were pretty striking. You can kind of see those exponents decreasing as you go. Now to get a sense of the scale that we're talking about here, what are some of the first few terms of this sequence? Well, the sequence starts off 1, 1, 2, 12, 288. Okay. And then jumps to 34,560. Wow. So you can see how quickly these numbers grow. That's a pretty explosive rate of increase. Yeah. I also noticed in the OEIS entry, there's a mention of some earlier indexing systems for superfactorials. Yes. You might see the superfactorial sequence referred to as M2049 or N0A11 in some older references. Got it. But they all represent the same thing. It's just different naming conventions. Right. The superfactorial sequence A000178 in the OEIS. Exactly. So our aim in this deep dive is to really explore why this particular sequence is so significant for number theory students, like you listening out there. Yeah. And we really want to highlight some of its key connections to other mathematical concepts. Okay. And hopefully give you a sense of its importance in this fascinating world of number theory. Yeah. Number theory is full of these beautiful connections. It is. And the superfactorials really exemplify that. Yeah, absolutely. One of the most fundamental connections is in linear algebra. Okay. Specifically with something called the Vandermonde determinant. Okay. The superfactorial of n is actually equal to the Vandermonde determinant of the numbers 1, 2, 3 up to n plus 1. The Vandermonde determinant. Right. Now that involves a matrix of powers, if I remember correctly. That's exactly right. Okay. It's the determinant of an n plus 1 by n plus 1 matrix. Right. Where the element in the i-th row and j-th column is i to the power of j. Okay. With i ranging from 1 to n plus 1 and j from 0 to n. Okay. What's remarkable here is that this determinant, which comes from the study of systems of linear equations and polynomial interpolation, simplifies to this product of factorials. I see. So this connection can provide alternative approaches to proving properties of either the determinant or the superfactorial itself. So it's a powerful link between algebra and number theory. Exactly. It highlights how these seemingly different areas of math are often deeply interconnected. Yeah. Are there other places where we see superfactorials popping up in the world of matrices? Yes, definitely. Okay. The n-th superfactorial, which we can denote as of n, is also related to the determinant of a specific n by n matrix, where the ijt element is i to the power of j. The precise relationship is A of n equals 1 over n factorial times d of n, where d of n is this determinant. So while slightly different from the Vandermonde case, we see another instance of superfactorials emerging from a determinant structure. It's interesting how these matrix formulations keep coming up. Yeah. It almost suggests that superfactorials are encoding some sort of fundamental algebraic property. It's possible they capture some essential structure that we're only beginning to understand. Exactly. And the connections extend beyond just standard determinants. Right. For odd indexed superfactorials, like a 2 of 2 and plus 1, we find them as the result of the Hankel transform of the tangent numbers, which is sequence A0000182 in the OEIS. Yes, another fascinating sequence. Right now, the Hankel transform, for our listeners who might not be familiar, what is that exactly? So the Hankel transform of a sequence is obtained by taking the determinants of a series of Hankel matrices formed from consecutive terms of that sequence. I got it. In this case, if you take the first n plus 1 tangent numbers and arrange them in a Hankel matrix, its determinant will be a specific odd indexed superfactorial. I see. So this links our sequence to another well-studied sequence with connections to combinatorics analysis. That's a pretty unexpected connection, right? It is. Factorials, determinants, and tangent numbers. It's quite remarkable. It really highlights how interconnected different areas of math can be. Absolutely. You wouldn't necessarily think those would all be related. Right, different tools and concepts. Right. But they converge in surprising ways. Exactly. And that's what makes it so fascinating. Indeed. Now, are there more connections to matrices? Yes, there are. Okay. The superfactorial also appears as the determinant of an n plus 1 by n plus 1 matrix, whose i-th row consists of the first n plus 1 terms of the Lucas sequence. Okay. U of i, q. And this holds true for any value of q. Now, the Lucas sequence, that's related to the Fibonacci sequence, right? That's right. Okay. The Lucas sequences are a family of integer sequences that satisfy the same linear recurrence relation as the Fibonacci sequence, but with different starting values. Right. The fact that the superfactorial appears as the determinant of such a matrix, regardless of the parameter q, suggests a deep underlying structure. I see. Interestingly, when q is specifically set to 0, this matrix simplifies to the Vandermonde matrix. Okay. We talked about earlier, providing a unifying link between these two matrix connections. So superfactorials really are kind of acting as a bridge between all these different mathematical objects. In a way. Vandermonde matrices. Yeah. Lucas sequences. Hankel transforms. It's fascinating. It really makes you wonder what other areas they might touch upon. Absolutely. There's always more to uncover. So where else do we find superfactorials? Well, let's step into the world of graph theory for a moment. Okay. The n superfactorial is also the multiplicative Wiener index of a path graph with n plus 1 vertices. The Wiener index, now that's a measure of the total distance within a graph, if I'm not mistaken. You're right. Okay. The standard Wiener index is the sum of the distances between all pairs of vertices in a graph. Right. The multiplicative Wiener index is a variation that involves the product of certain powers of these distances. Got it. For a simple path graph, this product elegantly simplifies to the n-th or sheephal factorial. I see. It's a beautiful example of an algebraic object appearing in a combinatorial setting. So it's a numerical invariant of a pretty fundamental graph structure. Exactly. One of the simplest graphs you can imagine. Right. And that's directly linked to this factorial product. That's a nice illustration of how different areas of mathematics intertwine. Yeah, absolutely. And are there other interesting properties of superfactorials that we should be aware of? Here's a fascinating one. Okay. Except for n equals 0 and n equals 1, superfactorials are never perfect squares. Okay. It's a curious fact. It is, right. Because given how fast they grow, you might think they would hit a perfect square every once in a while. You'd think so, but it turns out they never do. Right, except for those first two cases. That's exactly. Those are the only exceptions. Fascinating. So what else? Well, now let's delve into some slightly more advanced territory. Okay. The superfactorial A of n has a close relationship with a function called the Barnes G function. Okay. Which is a generalization of the gamma function. Okay, now the Barnes G function, that sounds like we're moving into more advanced mathematics. It is a bit more specialized. Okay. But it's a fascinating function that extends the concept of the factorial and the gamma function to more general arguments. Okay. And it appears in various areas of analysis and number theory. I see. The specific relationship is A of n equals G of n plus 2. Okay, so this connection with the Barnes G function allows us to use the properties of that function to study superfactorials. It gives us new tools and insights. Right, including things like their asymptotic behavior. Yes, their behavior for large values of n. So it gives us a better way to understand their growth rate. Precisely. And speaking of asymptotic behavior, there's a formula involving the glacier Kinklein constant. Okay. Which is A074962 in the OEIS. Right,
