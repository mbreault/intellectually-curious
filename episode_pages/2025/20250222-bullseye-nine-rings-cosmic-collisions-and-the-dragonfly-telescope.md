## Description

We explore Lita 1313424â€”the Bullseye galaxyâ€”with nine rings born from a head-on collision. Learn how rings form, how the Dragonfly Telephoto Array built from 48 Canon lenses revealed the faint outer ring, and how Hubble confirmed the structure. Weâ€™ll connect these findings to giant low surface brightness galaxies and what CRGs can reveal about galaxy evolutionâ€”and tease Part II.

## Transcript

All right, get ready for this one because today we are diving deep into a galaxy that's really in a league of its own. It's called Lita 1313424. Catchy name. I know, right? But you might know it by its nickname. Yeah, the Bullseye. Exactly, the Bullseye. Thanks to that crazy Hubble image. Seriously, if you haven't seen this one, look it up. Oh, you need to see it. We're talking about a galaxy with not one, not two, but nine rings. Can you believe that? Nine rings, it's nuts. It's wild, right? And astronomers are buzzing about it, you know, not just because it looks so cool, but for what it could tell us about how galaxies do their whole collision thing, how they form those rings. And even how they might turn into some of the most mysterious structures out there. And here's the kicker. What's that? Part of this discovery, get this, it all comes down to a telescope that's built with a bunch of Canon camera lenses. Camera lenses? Really? Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, right? But we'll get to that later. I'm intrigued. This is some seriously cool stuff. It really is. This goes way beyond just a pretty picture, you know. The Bullseye, it's really challenging what we thought we knew about collisional ring galaxies. Okay, so let's back up a sec. How do galaxies even get rings in the first place? Like, I've seen pictures of the Cartwheel Galaxy, but nine rings just seems like a bit much, even for, you know, the vastness of space. You're right to think of the Cartwheel. It's like the textbook example of what we call a collisional ring galaxy, or a CRG for short. CRG, got it. So basically, when a smaller galaxy, picture like a cosmic bullet, slams head-on into a bigger galaxy, it makes this ripple effect. Okay, I'm picturing it. Like if you drop a pebble in a pond. Oh, okay. Those ripples, their wave of energy that's spread out through the bigger galaxy, and what happens is all that gas and dust, it gets all clumped together. And those clunks, that's what makes the rings. Yeah, those clumps trigger a burst of star formation, and that's what we see as these brilliant rings. Wow, so it's like this crazy chain reaction. Exactly, a chain reaction set off by this, you know, massive collision. That's mind-blowing. But here's where the Bullseye gets even more interesting. Hold on, there's more. Oh, yeah. I'm all ears. So back in 2010, some researchers, they came up with this theory about the spacing between these rings. Like how far apart they are. Exactly, they figured it should be based on, you know, the physics of the collision, that there should be a certain ratio between the size of each ring. So like a predictable pattern. Yeah, imagine being able to predict where these cosmic features should show up, right? That's wild. But here's the thing. Up until the Bullseye, there were so few multi-ring galaxies out there. So they couldn't really test it. Right, it was tough to really put that theory to the test. Okay, so how do they actually confirm all those rings in the Bullseye? Do they just like point Hubble at it and be like, boom, there they are? It's actually kind of funny. It started with a ground-based survey. So not even Hubble right away. Nope, and get this, the rings were actually visible, even in those blurry images. Seriously? Yeah, the lead researcher, he knew he had stumbled onto something special. I bet. So he managed to snag some time on Hubble for a closer look. Good move. And what they saw, man, it was amazing. Could imagine. Those blurry rings from before, they became crystal clear, revealing eight distinct rings. Eight, just like that? Just like that. But here's the thing, they had a hunch. They suspected there might be even more rings hiding out there. Hiding, like playing cosmic hide and seek? Kind of, lurking in these really faint outer parts of the galaxy. So eight wasn't enough, huh? They were like, we think there's one more out there somewhere. Exactly, like there was a missing piece to this cosmic puzzle. Eight rings is already impressive, but there's more. How did they find those fainter rings? Was Hubble not powerful enough? They needed something a bit more specialized to see those fainter structures, something that could see the really faint stuff. Okay, so what did they use? They used something called the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. Dragonfly, okay, that sounds cool. What is that? So this array, get this, it uses 48 commercially available Canon telephoto lenses, all linked together. Hold up, they used camera lenses to study a galaxy millions of light years away? Yep. That's amazing, but how does that even work? So those lenses, they're specially coated to cut down on scattered light. So they can see the faint stuff. Exactly, they're perfect for spotting really faint objects. So they used camera lenses to find a galaxy ring, that's just wild, but how did they actually find it? They took these super deep images of the bullseye, but the tricky part was that this galaxy, it sits in a part of the sky that's kind of obscured by gas and dust from our own Milky Way. So it's like trying to see through a fog. Yeah, exactly, but the dragonfly with its unique design, it was able to cut through that haze, and after carefully subtracting the light from our own galaxy's gas, boom, there it was. They found it. They found it, this faint outer ring, and guess what? It was where the theory predicted. Right on the spot. That's incredible. It really is, it's like the universe was giving us a little wink, you know, like, hey, you guys are on the right track with this whole collision thing. I love that, so we've got nine rings, maybe even 10, my mind is officially blown, but we still haven't talked about what actually slammed into this galaxy to make this cosmic bullseye in the first place. Right, the big question, what caused this whole mess? Exactly, do we know? We do. Spill the cosmic tea. Remember that blue clumpy galaxy that you see in the Hubble image? Yeah. Researchers used a technique called spectroscopy to analyze the light coming from that galaxy, and yep, you guessed it, that's our culprit. So that little blue galaxy is the cosmic bullet that made the bullseye. That's amazing, but how can they be so sure it was that galaxy specifically? They found this evidence of disturbed gas between the two galaxies. Think of it like skid marks at the scene of an accident. Cosmic skid marks. This disturbed gas, it tells us there was a recent collision, and that blue galaxy was almost certainly involved. So the bullseye got hit by another galaxy, and that smaller galaxy wasn't completely destroyed. It's still out there, just cruising along. Yep, just hanging out there, looking all blue and bruised. That's wild, and you know what? That's where this whole deep dive takes an even more interesting turn. Oh, how so? Because the bullseye might actually hold some clues to an even bigger mystery. A bigger mystery, I'm listening. These things called giant low surface brightness galaxies, GLSBs for short. GLSBs, those are fascinating. They are, tell me more about them. So these galaxies, they're absolutely massive. Some are even bigger than the Milky Way, but they're so faint and spread out, they're incredibly hard to see. So like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but the haystack is the entire universe? Yeah, something like that. So we've got these giant ghostly galaxies just lurking out there in the dark. But what did that have to do with the bullseye? Is it on its way to becoming one of these GLSB galaxies? That's the thing. That's what's so intriguing about this whole discovery. Oh, it could be. There's a theory out there that these faint giant galaxies could be the faded remnants of ancient CRGs, like the bullseye. Ah, I see. Think about it. As those rings expand over time, the stars inside them age and eventually die out, and that makes the galaxy's overall brightness go down. And eventually it starts to look like a GLSB. Exactly. It's like the bullseye is giving us a sneak peek into the distant future of these kinds of collisions. Like a preview of what it might become. Right, and there's actually some evidence suggesting the bullseye might already be on that path. Really? So what kind of evidence? Well, I remember that super faint outer ring we talked about? Yeah. That thing stretches out over a mind-blowing 250,000 light years. That's huge. It's enormous, like on par with some of the biggest GLSB galaxies we've seen. And on top of that, the bullseye has a ton of hydrogen gas, which is another thing GLSB galaxies are known for. So we've got the size, the gas, and a history of some pretty intense collisions. It really does sound like it's on its way to becoming a GLSB. But is this how all GLSB galaxies form? Or is the bullseye just a special case? That is the million dollar question. And one we'll have to keep exploring. This is one cosmic mystery I can't wait to see solved. But unfortunately, we're out of time for this part of our deep dive. Don't worry, we'll be back soon with part two to dive even deeper into those mysteries. We'll unpack those theoretical predictions, talk about the challenges of actually observing these faint
