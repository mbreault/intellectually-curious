## Transcript

Welcome back to the Science Corner where we, you know, satisfy our curiosity for all things science, right? Absolutely. And today we're diving deep, no pun intended, into a truly wild chapter of the Cold War. We're talking about Project Azorian. Oh, an amazing story. Yeah, it's a 1974 CIA operation and the goal was to recover, get this, a sunken Soviet submarine from like the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. And just the idea of it is mind-blowing. It is absolutely incredible. And for those who love science and technology, it's especially fascinating because of the audacity of it all. Imagine trying to bring up a vessel that size from over three miles underwater. It took a level of innovation that, well, had never been seen before and a real willingness to tackle those huge engineering challenges. Yeah, it's just incredible. So to really get into the why behind this whole crazy operation, I think we need to rewind back to 1968 when the Soviet submarine, the K-129 sank. So tell me, what can you tell us about this submarine and how it ended up at the bottom of the ocean? Well, the K-129 was a Soviet ballistic missile submarine. So think nuclear missiles, a pretty serious piece of hardware. In late February of 1968, it set off on a routine patrol in the Pacific. And this is important. Its last contact was very early in the voyage. When it didn't check in as scheduled, the Soviet Navy started looking for it. This was in April, but they couldn't find it. So the Soviets lost their own submarine. And how did the US even know about it, let alone figure out where it was in the middle of the Pacific? That's where things get really interesting. You see, underwater acoustics played a key role. We had this system, the Sound Surveillance System, or SOSUS, which was basically a network of underwater microphones called hydrophones placed on the ocean floor. And these hydrophones picked up some strange sounds on March 8th, 1968. Like imagine a giant listening network spread across the ocean floor. Yeah. And data from multiple SOSUS sites, including ones in Edek, Alaska, that were run by the Air Force Technical Application Center, they all pointed to an explosion, a big one. And the naval facility at Point Sur in California, they were able to pick out a specific sound that, well, matched an implosion, all happening at the same time. And by analyzing where these sounds came from on the different SOSUS lines, US Naval Intelligence was able to sort of triangulate the approximate location of the wreckage. They narrowed it down to about 1,560 miles northwest of Hawaii. It's like solving a giant underwater puzzle using sound. I love it. So they had a rough idea of where the K-129 was, but how did they actually pinpoint it on the ocean floor? Okay, so for this, they brought in the USS Halibut. This was a submarine that had been specially outfitted for deep sea searches. And July of 68, under a secret operation called Operation Sand Dollar, the Halibut went out with all this advanced deep submergence equipment, think really sophisticated sonar and cameras. It took them, oh, about three weeks of searching, but finally they found the K-129. Wow. And get this, it was at a depth of 16,500 feet. That's three miles or five kilometers straight down. Just imagine the pressure at that depth. Our technology had honestly never really had to deal with anything like that before. Yeah, three miles down. That's almost unfathomable. And the Halibut didn't just find it. They also took like a ton of photos. You got it. The USS Halibut reportedly took over 20,000 close-up photos of the K-129. I mean, talk about dedication. And all this photographic intelligence, it was gold. CIA analysts at the National Photographic Interpretation Center, they pored over these pictures to figure out the condition of the sub and see what could be salvaged. It was a phenomenal effort in underwater reconnaissance, so much so that the USS Halibut actually received a Presidential Unit Citation for it. That's impressive. So based on these photos, what did they think they could learn from the K-129? What exactly were they hoping to get from it? Well, the CIA, they figured that there was a good chance that at least one of the K-129's R-21 nuclear missiles was still in one piece, specifically the one in missile tube number three. And on top of that, they were really keen on getting any cryptographic documents and equipment, you know, things that could help them crack Soviet communication codes. That kind of intel would have been, well, invaluable during the Cold War. So they had the location and they believed it was packed with secrets. And this, I guess, is where this audacious plan to actually lift it from the seabed comes in. And, of course, there's the legendary ship, the Hughes Glomar Explorer. How did they even come up with this crazy idea in the first place? Right. So in 1970, with all the evidence from the Halibut's photos, the Defense Secretary at the time, Melvin Laird, and the National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger, they went to President Nixon with this top secret plan. They wanted to try and secretly recover the K-129. Their goal was to study Soviet nuclear missile technology and, of course, to get their hands on any cryptographic materials. President Nixon, he gave them the green light and the CIA was put in charge of this monumental task. The technology they needed, it was unlike anything that had ever been done before. And that's where Howard Hughes and his deep sea mining operation come in, right? Yeah. That's a cover story almost as wild as the actual mission. Oh, absolutely. To keep it all under wraps, and that was, well, essential for something this sensitive, the CIA reached out to the enigmatic billionaire Howard Hughes. Hughes, through his companies, he'd been involved in some classified U.S. military projects before, and he agreed to let them use his name and the image of his company, Global Marine Development, Inc., to create this cover story that the giant ship they were building, the Hughes Glomar Explorer, was for, get this, deep sea manganese nodule mining. And Global Marine Development, Inc., they did actually design, build, and operate the ship. But Hughes himself, while he wasn't involved in the day-to-day stuff, it was a brilliant way to mislead everyone. The Glomar Explorer must have been an incredible feat of engineering. What was so special about it? I mean, it was built just for this mission, right? Oh, yeah. It was custom made. The Hughes Glomar Explorer was a massive, and I mean massive, deep sea drill ship platform. And it cost a fortune. They spent over $350 million on it in 1974, which, if you do the math, is well over $1.68 billion in today's money. One of the coolest things about it was this huge internal bay called a moon pool. It was basically a big opening right in the middle of the hull so they could do things underwater, completely hidden from view. And to deal with the sheer weight of everything they were trying to lift, they needed a whole other special ship, the Sun 800, just to put its 630-ton gimbal system in place. And this gimbal, that was key to keep the long pipe string they were using to lower and raise the recovery vehicle stable. Wow. The level of investment and the specialized engineering for one secret operation, it's just mind-boggling. But before they even sent the Glomar Explorer to the K-129 site, did they do any prep work or gather any data? Oh, yeah, absolutely. They had at least two known prep missions. There was Project Xminster, which used the drilling ship Glomar 2 second in 1970 and 71. That mission was all about gathering important information about the depths and the seafloor in the area where the K-129 was, crucial for planning their recovery. Then from January to July 72, they sent out the RVC Scope, a research vessel, to do even more detailed surveys. They got within about 45 nautical miles of where they planned to do the recovery. And these missions also helped them keep an eye out for any Soviet ships in the area and see how they might react to a big, supposedly civilian research vessel hanging around there. So they're building this unique ship, they're doing all this prep work, and it's all to get those secrets that were inside the K-129. What specifically were they after? Well, the United States Intelligence Board had a list of high-priority targets. Number one was a nuclear warhead, if it was still intact. Then there was the cryptographic equipment and any documents that went with it. That could have been huge for breaking Soviet communication security. They also wanted an SSN-5 missile itself, the sub's navigation system, its fire control system, the sonar used to find other subs, any anti-submarine warfare countermeasures the K-129 might have had, and, of course, any technical manuals or instructions they could get their hands on. Okay, so the stage is set. They've got this amazing ship built, they've done their homework, they know what they're after. What happened when the Glomar Explorer finally made it to the K-129, you know, way back in the summer of 1974? Well, the Hughes Glomar Explorer, it arrived at the recovery site on July 4th, 1974. It had set sail from Long Beach on June 20th, very hush-hush, of course. The star of the show, the thing they were using to actually do the lifting, was this
