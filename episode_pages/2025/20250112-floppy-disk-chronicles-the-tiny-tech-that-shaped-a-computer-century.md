## Description

Join us as we rewind from IBM's eight-inch 'minnow' to Sony's battle-tested 3.5-inch standard. We'll uncover the format wars, clever encoding tricks like GCR, and industry moves that made the 3.5-inch the default for a generation of PCsâ€”and the worldâ€™s reliance on the save icon. Along the way, weâ€™ll see how this tiny, dusty disk rose to dominance and then faded away, leaving a surprising footprint in our digital memory.

## Transcript

All right, so buckle up everyone because today we are going deep, deep, deep into the history of something, well, maybe a little unexpected. Unexpected is putting it lightly. Yeah, yeah, we're talking about the floppy disk. The floppy disk. Oh, I know, I know, you might be thinking, really? Floppy disks. But trust me on this one. It's a surprisingly fascinating story, you know, full of twists and turns. More than you'd think, right? Oh, yeah, absolutely. We've got timelines, articles, even encyclopedia entries. I thought we went deep. We did, we really dug in. So just to set the stage, what are we really trying to understand here? I think the big question is, how did this little piece of tech that we all probably remember, at least some of us, how did it come to be? How did it rise to like total dominance? And then how did it ultimately fade away? Yeah, and the fade away is almost more interesting than the rise to dominance, isn't it? Yeah, because I mean, these things were everywhere. Totally, like the save icon that's a floppy disk. Exactly, exactly. It's like embedded in our cultural memory. So rewind with me. Way back. Way back to the late 1960s, bell bottoms, the whole thing. The whole groovy scene. And we're at IBM, Big Blue, and they've got a problem. They did have a problem. They needed a cheap way to ship microcode, which is like basically the instructions for their big mainframe systems, right? Yeah, and they were looking for something more reliable and cheaper than what they were using at the time. I mean, imagine like shipping punch cards. That's got to be like boxes and boxes. Oh yeah, logistical nightmare. Total nightmare. So in 1971, boom, the floppy disk is born. Eight inches in diameter. Eight inches, that's huge. That's massive compared to what we're used to. And it was read only, so you could only read data from it, not write to it. And it had a whopping 80 kilobytes of storage. 80 kilobytes. My phone can hold like a million times that. Yeah, and it had a cute little nickname too, the minnow. The minnow. Yeah, I guess, I mean, it must have seemed tiny compared to what they were using before. So picture this, these early floppies, totally bare. No case, just the disc itself? Vulnerable to like everything, dust, dirt, you name it. Yeah, not ideal for reliability. And that's actually what led to one of the key features of the floppy disk as we know it, right? Absolutely. They needed to protect the disc, so they started enclosing it in this envelope lined with fabric, you know, to trap dust particles. It's like the first dust jacket. Yeah, yeah, exactly. A dust jacket for your data. But at this point, it's still mostly an IBM thing, an internal tool. Not really for the public yet. Not yet, but then 1972, Memorex enters the scene. Memorex, yeah, those guys. And they drop a bombshell. The Memorex 650, the first commercially available read-write floppy disk drive. Still eight inches. But now you can not only read, but also write data. Imagine the possibilities. Yeah, like actually saving stuff, game changer. Oh, totally. It opened up a whole new world of computing, of data storage. It's like the beginning of personal computing right there. Now, I do have to ask about something called hard sector disks. Oh yeah, that's an important detail. So in the early days, a lot of these floppy disks were hard sectored, meaning they had physical holes punched in to mark sectors for data organization. So like pre-slicing the pie for easy serving? Exactly, exactly. It's a good analogy. So each sector could hold a certain amount of data, and the drive could easily find it because of those physical markers. And just for context, IBM did eventually release their own read-write floppy drive, the 33FD. In 1973, yeah. But things were already moving towards smaller formats. Oh yeah, the miniaturization was just beginning. So fast forward to 1976, disco is in full swing. Platform shoes, the whole deal. And Shugart Associates introduces the 5.25-inch floppy disk drive. This is the one that a lot of people will remember, the classic floppy disk size. And it was a game changer, right? Absolutely. It was smaller, more affordable, and it really took off with the rise of early microcomputers. Like the computers that were actually starting to show up in people's homes and offices. Exactly, exactly. These weren't mainframes anymore. These were personal computers. So the 5.25-inch floppy disk really became synonymous with this whole new wave of personal computing. Yeah, but it wasn't all smooth sailing. I mean, there were a lot of different formats floating around. Well, the format wars, right? Oh yeah, it got messy. There were different sectoring schemes, different encoding methods, track densities. It was a bit of a wild west. So wait, encoding schemes, can you break that down for me? Like, what is that exactly? Think of it like different languages for storing data on the disk. Some are more efficient. You know, they let you pack more information onto the same space. Okay, so like some languages are more concise than others. Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's about how you represent the data, the ones and zeros, in a way that the drive can read. So who emerged as a leader from this chaotic mix of formats? Well, Steve Wozniak over at Apple. He developed a really clever encoding scheme called group-coded recording, or GCR, and that's what they used in their Disk II drive. And that allowed them to squeeze a then whopping 140 kilobytes onto a single-sided 5.25-inch floppy. That's pretty impressive. They were really pushing the limits, right? Oh, absolutely. Always trying to get more bang for your buck. More storage. And speaking of pushing limits, there's that whole thing with flippy disks, right? People cutting notches so they could use both sides. Oh, yeah. The legendary flippy disks double your storage, but at your own risk. Yeah, I can imagine some data getting lost in the process. Yeah, not the most reliable method. But hey, people were creative. Necessity is the mother of invention, right? Exactly, exactly. They wanted more storage, and they were willing to take some risks to get it. But even with all the clever workarounds, the 5.25-inch floppy eventually hit its limits, right? Oh, yeah. It was only a matter of time before something new came along. Something smaller. Something with more storage. Something to usher in a new era of floppy disks. But that's a story for another time. Welcome back to our deep dive into floppy disk history. All right, so last time we left off, the 5.25-inch floppy disk, king of the hill, starting to show its age. Yeah, the limitations were becoming pretty clear. Right, so like what happened next? What filled that need for more storage, more portability? Well, you know, like we talked about, there were all these different sizes floating around. Right, the 2-inch, the 3-inch. It was like a floppy disk free-for-all. It really was a battle for floppy disk supremacy, you could say. And the winner is... Drumroll, please. The 3.5-inch format. Ah, yes, the 3.5-inch. Pioneered by Sony, first appeared in 81 with, you know, a pretty modest capacity at first, but... But destined for greatness. Destined for greatness, exactly. I mean, that's the one I remember, that rigid plastic case. So much more durable than those flimsy 5.25s. Oh, yeah, night and day, and the sliding write-protect tab, much more compact. It was like designed with usability in mind. They really thought about the user experience, even back then. They did, which is, you know, probably part of why it ultimately won out. Won out, but it wasn't an immediate success, was it? I mean, it took some time for the 3.5-inch to really become the standard. You're right, it wasn't an overnight thing. A key factor was the Microfloppy Industry Committee, or MIC. Catchy name. Yeah, they worked with Sony to, like, actually establish a standard for the 3.5-inch format, which is, you know, huge, because it meant compatibility across different manufacturers. So it wasn't just about the tech itself, but about, like, industry collaboration, setting standards. Exactly, because without that, you know, you end up with the same kind of mess we saw with the 5.25-inch. Right, the format wars, nobody wants that. Nobody wants that. So, yeah, the MIC played a big role in the 3.5-inch's eventual success. Okay, so Apple, known for sometimes going their own way, when did they finally embrace the 3.5-inch? Their adoption was a turning point, actually. When they chose the 3.5-inch format for the Macintosh in 84, I mean, that sent a strong signal to the rest of the industry. Like, okay, this is the one. Yeah, pretty much. If Apple's on board, you know, it's probably going to be big. So Apple, despite the twiggy misstep, ended up playing a crucial role in the 3.5-inch's dominance. That's interesting. It is. It shows that even the
