## Description

In this Deep Dive we explore OEIS A000191: the generalized tangent numbers. We walk through their definition via generating functions for two related families, t_n^(k) and s_n^(k), which generalize the classical tangent and secant numbers. Weâ€™ll touch on when these numbers vanish based on parity, how they relate to the ordinary tangent numbers, and practical ways to compute them via recurrences or an explicit double-sum formula (Schott). Weâ€™ll also uncover their rich combinatorial connections: a Bell-polynomial representation, links to Stirling and Lah numbers, and relations to arc-tangent numbers and TQ-analogs. Along the way, youâ€™ll see how these numbers sit at a crossroad of analysis and combinatorics, offering a compact window into the deep structure behind a single OEIS entry.

## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. We're continuing our journey through the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS. Today we're focusing on a really interesting one, A000191, the generalized tangent numbers. For anyone working in number theory, you know the OEIS is just invaluable. It catalogs sequences, but it also, well, it reveals these surprising links across math. Think of this Deep Dive as another way to explore that landscape. Absolutely. The OEIS is really a powerful hub. You might find a sequence, maybe in combinatorics, look it up, and suddenly you're seeing connections to analysis you hadn't imagined. It's brilliant for building intuition, seeing how interconnected things are. And that's exactly our aim today with A000191. These generalized tangent numbers, they extend the classical tangent numbers, you know, the coefficients from the Taylor series for tan x. We've pulled together some key research, and the goal here is to give a, let's say, a clear but concise introduction. Definitions, properties, some surprising appearances, enough to get you started. So let's jump right in. Where do these numbers actually, well, where are they defined? Right. Probably the clearest starting point is their generating function. Kriyevich's 2011 paper on higher-order tangent and secant numbers lays this out very nicely. The nth tangent number of order k, let's call it tn, k, is defined by this equation. Fract in k. Okay, hold on. Let's unpack that a bit. A generating function sounds complex, but it's really just a way to encode a whole sequence into one function, a power series, right? So if you expand that fract in k, the coefficient sitting next to fract is the number tnnk, and the order k is just the power of that hyperbolic tangent. Exactly. That's precisely it. And Kriyevich also introduces a related family, the nth second number of order k, similar idea, different function, fract in k, snk. Notice the second function popping up there, too. Okay, so two families, kn, kn, k and kn, depends on n from the power of t and k, the order. Now, you mentioned these extend the classical tangent numbers. How does that connection work? Are they special cases? Yes, exactly. They ground it nicely. The classical tangent numbers, usually written dollars are just 2, d onos, order k1. And similarly for the second numbers, if you set k0 in the 0k definition, you get 0ssl, the classical second number. So they really are generalizations. That helps. A good anchor point. Okay, so we had the definitions. What about basic properties? Like, when are these things even non-zero? Good question. That's fundamental. Kriyevich's Proposition 1 gives a clear rule. TMNN is non-zero only when tau is between 1 and non-inclusive. And here's the key part. N and tau must have the same parity, both even or both odd. Same rule applies to CON, though tau can be zero there. So 0 to 1 at the same parity. Huh. That's interesting. So, like, T5, 2 dollars would be zero automatically because 5 is odd and 2 is even, like a built-in filter. Precisely. It rules out many possibilities immediately. Are there any specific values we know or relationships to get a feel for them? Yes. We know that when not equals T-adder, it's just the 6th classical tangent number, T-adder. For 9 greater than k, there is a recurrence, though it looks, well, a bit involved. It's Tkaran plus 1 dr plus 1 n e a m left plus 1 TNN. Plus 1 n TNNK. Wow. Okay. Yeah, that looks like something you'd rather compute than do by hand. What about the connection between the two families, C and K and T? Is there a direct link? There is. Proposition 3 in the paper gives it. C on K on K sn y d. It shows how the order k secant numbers are built from the order k tangent numbers and the classical secant numbers using binomial coefficients. They're definitely intertwined. Right, a nice bridge. Now, the paper also mentions Bell polynomials. If that rings a bell. Pardon the pun. They're important in combinatorics, right? How do TNN fit in? They fit in quite beautifully, actually. Proposition 4 states that 2 dogs can be expressed as a partial multivariate Bell polynomial. TNNK nK T1 T2 elladots TNN dog. This is significant because Bell polynomials count partitions of sets. So it immediately tells us these generalized tangent numbers aren't just analytic objects from generating functions. They likely have a concrete combinatorial meaning. They're counting something. Okay, so it's not just a symbolic formula. It implies they represent counts of discrete structures. What else does that Bell polynomial connection tell us? Well, structurally, it means 2 dollars is a polynomial in the classical tangent numbers. 2 dollars up to 2 dollars is a special kind of polynomial. Homogeneous of total degree dollars and isobaric of total weight in dollars. Homogeneous, isobaric. Okay, can you break that down? Sure. Homogeneous of degree dollar just means every term in the polynomial when you write it out in terms of dollars has 2 dollars of those dollars multiplied together. The total count is a tail count. Isobaric of weight means if you assign a weight to each dollar equal to its index i dollars, then in every term, the sum of the weights adds up to dollars. Ah, okay. So it imposes a very specific structure based on the indices and the number of terms. Does the paper give examples? Yes. Example 1 shows this. Like, T23 dollars, that's just 3 3 dollars, degree 1, weight 3, checks out. And T3 allows 2 plays golds for T1 T3 3. The degree is 2, 1 T dollar, 1 T3 3. The weight is 1 dollar plus 3 equals to 4 3 dollars. It really shows how the higher order ones are built from the classical ones following these rules. Very clear. Now, besides that complicated recurrence earlier, are there simpler ways to calculate these? Maybe more direct recurrence relations? Yes. Proposition 5 gives cleaner recurrences specifically for computation. For 2 dollars, we have TTM plus 1 TTMK1 plus KK plus 1 TNK plus 1 dollars. You need the initial conditions, 2 dollars and 2 3 for 1 dollars. For 1 dollar, it relates a value to ones at the previous n but adjacent k values. That looks much more manageable. A nice recursive structure. And for the students, 3K numbers? A very similar pattern. 0M plus 1 K arrows SNK1 plus K plus 1 TSK plus 1 dollars. And the initial condition here is SN, the classical second numbers, for all 1G or 0G. As Viobich points out, these are great for generating tables of values, like tables 1 and 2 in the paper. Okay, so recursive methods are covered. What about just an explicit formula? Something where you plug in N and K and get the number directly? No recursion needed. There is one given in Proposition 8, attributed to Schott. It involves a double sum, so it's not exactly simple looking, but it is explicit. TTMK N minus 1 NKT 2N minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 alpha minus 1. Phew. Okay, yes, explicit but definitely complex. Still remarkable that such a formula exists. The paper also links TNN and K to other combinatorial numbers like Stirling and Law numbers. It does. In Proposition 9, it gives formulas expressing 2 dollars and dollars using Stirling numbers of the second kind, ZN M alpha and Law numbers, Law alpha. For example, 2N MK N M L M M N N M alpha minus 1. There's another one involving Law numbers too. These connections just further cement the idea that generalized tangent numbers are deeply rooted in core combinatorial principles. It really is a web of connections. Now, something else mentioned was arc tangent numbers. That seems different from the hyperbolic tangent we started with. Why arc tan? It's another interesting thread. The paper defines these higher order arc tangent numbers, TNN KM again via a generating function. Fract N and M M KM. Or there's a recurrence, TNN KM KM M N M N TN M N plus 1 K. Note the minus sign there. So standard arc tan this time. How does it link back to our TNN K generalized tangent numbers? Proposition 7 gives the formula. TK, front 1, sum yela, k has plus frail on TKR plus 1 dollar. It expresses TLNs using classical tangent numbers and these higher order arc tangent numbers. Example 2 shows this explicitly for small values. Fascinating. It seems these TNN K numbers really sit at a crossroads. The outline also mentioned TQ analogs. That sounds like tall series territory, often used for refined counting. Exactly. We're moving into generalizations that track extra statistics. The Foda and Hahn paper from 2011 introduces these. They define T telonomials plus 1 telq and E tel teller as TQ analogs for tangent and secant numbers. These are polynomials in TLS. And presumably they have combinatorial interpretations. They aren't just formal objects. Oh, definitely. Foda and Hahn connect them to alternating permutations. The coefficients in teloteller track statistics on these permutations like Ides, inverse descents, and Amage
