## Transcript

Welcome to The Deep Dive. Today we're digging into the sources behind a dish you probably think you know pretty well, the Caesar salad. Yeah, forget the Roman Emperor connection. The real story is much more recent and honestly kind of unexpected. It really is. And, you know, it's actually celebrating its centennial this year, 2024, born out of, well, necessity in a very specific place and time. Okay, let's unpack that. The sources point to an Italian immigrant chef, Cesar Cardini, creating it in Tijuana, Mexico, July 4th, 1924. Exactly. And the why Tijuana part's fascinating. Cardini had restaurants on both sides of the border, right? But during Prohibition, his Tijuana place was booming. You had all these American tourists crossing over for legal cocktails, for entertainment. Ah, okay. A Prohibition hotspot. Totally. And the story goes, this huge 4th of July rush just wiped out his kitchen supplies. He was forced to improvise with whatever was left. Wow. So what did he actually have? Sounds like not much. Well, the sources mentioned things like lettuce stalks, whole romaine leaves, apparently olive oil, raw egg, Parmesan, Worcestershire sauce. Raw egg. And whole leaves. So, like, finger food. That's the story. Julia Child even talked about seeing it prepared tableside like that back in the 20s. That's amazing. Just those few things created that flavor. Well, it's simple but complex, you know? And this gets us to the big debate. What was in that original dressing? Okay. Cardini's daughter was adamant her father wanted a subtle salad. She insisted he specifically didn't use anchovies. Wait, no anchovies. But that salty umami thing, isn't that key? For many modern versions, yes. But she claimed the Worcestershire sauce provided enough of that. She actually said something like, a proper Caesar always has anchovy, but an authentic one never does. Okay, that's confusing but interesting. It really highlights this whole idea of culinary authenticity, doesn't it? How dishes change. Yeah. The original sounds like romaine, olive oil, the raw egg yolk, Parmesan Reggiano, Worcestershire, maybe some lime juice, and toasted bits of baguette. So simple. Yeah. But it took off. Oh, yeah. Became a massive hit, especially with Hollywood types visiting Tijuana. It spread really fast. And your sources mention it got a pretty major award in Paris in 1953. It did. Named the greatest recipe to originate in the Americas in the past 50 years by this International Food Society. Quite the journey from an improvised dish. Definitely a glow up. And then, you know, the 1990s really sealed its fate as a global staple. How so? It had that sort of chefy feel, but it was also approachable. And critically, you could easily add chicken or shrimp on top. It became a main course. Right, like center of the plate. Exactly. And it fit perfectly with that whole California cuisine trend happening then. Fresh, lighter, maybe. And now, it seems like it's a base for everything. The sources mention all sorts of variations. Oh, completely. You see spicy Sonoma Caesars, Mexican Caesars with cotija and jalapenos, even like miso Caesars with shiitake mushrooms. Wild. And kale Caesars, right? The whole superfood angle? Yeah, kale, hemp hearts. Plus that trend of bringing back tableside preparation for the experience. It's constantly being reinvented. So why has it lasted? What's the magic? I think it comes down to a few things. That satisfying crunch, you know, the creamy, high-impact dressing. And romaine is just easy. Approachable. Plus, it's incredibly versatile. It just works in so many contexts. And people still see it as fresh, maybe even healthy-ish, despite the dressing sometimes. Your sources say it's still huge on delivery apps. Definitely. And the demographic trends look good, too. Millennials apparently order it significantly more often. So it's not going anywhere soon. Doesn't seem like it. Okay, so from a last-minute fix in a Tijuana kitchen during Prohibition to this global menu mainstay with countless spinoffs, it's quite a story. It really is. It's more than just food history, isn't it? It's about how culture flows, how things adapt, and what authentic even means anymore. Yeah. So maybe the next time you order a Caesar, think about this. How much can something change adding ingredients the creator specifically avoided before it becomes something totally new? And what does that transformation tell us about balancing innovation and tradition, not just in food, but maybe everywhere else, too?
