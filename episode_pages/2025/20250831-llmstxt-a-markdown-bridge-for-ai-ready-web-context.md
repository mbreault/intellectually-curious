## Description

We explore a proposed standard that gives LLMs a concise, structured briefing about a website. llms.txt complements robots.txt and sitemaps by delivering AI-friendly guidance and links to detailed pages, all in a lightweight, human- and machine-readable format. Learn the required structure (site name in an H1, a brief abstract in a block quote, and H2 sections with name, URL, and description), plus an optional section for secondary info and practical tooling like llms.txt2txt. We discuss best practices for content creators and what this could unlock in AI-assisted knowledge discovery.

## Transcript

Welcome, curious minds, to another deep dive. Today, we're tackling something pretty critical in computer science, actually. How do large language models, LLMs, really get a handle on the sheer mass of stuff on the internet? Yeah, it's a huge challenge. And we're looking at this really interesting proposal for a new standard. It's called the llms.txt file. That's right. You know, for all their power, LLMs bump up against a major limitation. Their context windows. They just aren't big enough for, well, entire websites. Right. And trying to convert complex HTML, you know, with all the navigation ads, JavaScript bits, into something clean and simple for an LLM, it's really difficult and often not very accurate. So it loses the meaning sometimes. It can, yeah. This new standard, llms.txt, it aims to give LLMs more concise sort of expert-level information, all in one place. Okay, let's unpack that a bit. So you're saying websites as they are now, they're designed for people, for human readers. Yeah, visually dense, interactive. Which makes them kind of overwhelming for an LLM that just needs the core facts quickly. Precisely. LLMs need focused, relevant stuff, especially, you know, for specific tasks. Think about programmers needing documentation or understanding APIs or even just structured business info. Yeah, anyone who's tried web scraping knows that pain. Right, it's about getting past all that web clutter, the noise. Okay, so this llms.txt idea, this is where it gets really interesting. It's a markdown file you add to the website. Yep, exactly. Its main job is to offer a brief background, some guidance, and crucially, links. Links to detailed markdown versions of specific pages. Markdown versions. Often just by adding .md to the original URL. So like example.html becomes example.html.md. It's a way to provide that clean semantic version we talked about. Oh, okay. And the llms.txt file itself has a structure. A very specific markdown structure, yes. It needs an H1 heading for the site name. That's the only required bit, actually. Then usually a block quote for a short summary. Like an abstract. Sort of, yeah. And then H2 sections that contain these file lists. Basically lists of links formatted like name, URL, description. Simple, readable for humans and machines. And I saw something about an optional section in the format. What's that for? Oh, that's quite clever. It lets the website owner flag information that's maybe secondary. Less critical. So the LLM can skip it. Exactly. If it needs a shorter context, maybe because of its own limits, it can just ignore the optional stuff. Helps manage those context windows effectively. That makes sense. So how does this fit in with things we already have, like robots.txt or sitemaps? Is it competing? Not really competing, more complementing. It's a different job. Robots.txt tells automated tools like search crawlers what not to look at for indexing purposes. Right, exclusion. Yeah. And sitemap.xml lists, well, all the pages for humans. But llms.txt, it's about providing curated context for allowed content, specifically for AI inference. Inference, meaning when a user actually asks the LLM a question about the site. Precisely. It's not just listing pages. It's actively guiding the AI to the best, most relevant, LLM-friendly information. It can even point to external resources if they're relevant. It's a more intentional approach. A different paradigm almost. Moving from just listing to actually optimizing for AI understanding. You could say that, yeah. Okay, so if a site owner, maybe a company with complex documentation, wants to implement this, are there tools available? How practical is it right now? Yes, definitely practical. There's the LLMs.txt project. It offers a command line tool and a Python module, LLMs.txt2txt. And what do they do? They help parse these LLMs.txt files and format the content correctly for an LLM context, often into XML, which works well for models like CLOG, for example. Gotcha. And any quick tips for creating a good LLMs.txt? Keep it concise. Use clear language. Make the link descriptions brief but informative. Avoid jargon where possible. And really important, test it. Test it. Yeah, test your LLMs.txt with different LLMs if you can. See how they interpret the context you're providing. Make sure it actually works as intended. It really is quite something. How a relatively simple structured text file could potentially make such a big difference in how AI agents navigate and use the web's information. It really could streamline things. Makes the web potentially much more accessible and useful to LLMs for specific knowledge tasks. So a final thought then, it seems this really pushes us to think about content differently. Absolutely. And maybe this is the question for you, our listener. As AI becomes more integral to how we find and process information, how should content creators adapt? How do we best serve both human readers and these increasingly capable AI intelligences? And, you know, what new ways of discovering knowledge might this unlock?
