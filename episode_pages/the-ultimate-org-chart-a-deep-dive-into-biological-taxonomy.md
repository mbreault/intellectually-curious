## Description

We explore how biologists turn the messy diversity of life into a coherent map. Starting with Linnaeus's hierarchical system and binomial names, through Darwin's evolution, to cladistics and DNA-based phylogenies, and finally the naming codes and debates over ranks. A clear, engaging tour of how taxonomy shapes biology.

## Transcript

Okay, think about the last time you were looking for something specific online. Imagine if the internet, you know, had a zero organization. No tags, no categories, just this massive jumble of stuff. Finding anything would be impossible. Just chaos. Exactly. Now scale that idea way, way up to the whole natural world. Trillions of organisms, all unique, but, you know, connected somehow. How do scientists even start to make sense of that? All that biodiversity. Well, that's really the core question, isn't it? That's what biological taxonomy tries to tackle. Welcome to Science Corner, everyone. Today on the Deep Dive, we're jumping into this really fascinating area, biological taxonomic rank and nomenclature. Right. You've probably heard terms like kingdom, phylum, species. We all have. But they're not just random labels. They're part of a, well, a pretty sophisticated system for classifying and naming everything alive. It's basically the ultimate org chart for life on Earth. The ultimate org chart. I like that. And it's definitely not something that just poof appeared overnight. Oh, absolutely not. It's built up over centuries. Observation, debate, new discoveries. So today, we'll unpack the big steps, you know? From the early days right up to how evolution changed things. We want to give you a clear picture of why this maybe seemingly technical field is actually so fundamental to biology. And we'll be looking at historical accounts, current scientific thinking, just to give a solid overview. Yeah, our goal really is to offer you, our intellectually curious listeners, a clear and hopefully engaging introduction to how we map out life's connections. Okay, so where do we start? I think we have to begin with Carl Linnaeus. Mid-18th century. His work, especially Systema Naturae, was just revolutionary for its time. Revolutionary how? What was the key thing he did? Well, the really big insight was introducing a hierarchical system. Like rungs on a ladder. Kingdom, class, order, genus, species. It sounds simple now, maybe, but it imposed this unprecedented structure onto the kind of messy study of nature back then. Okay, so before Linnaeus it was more? Just describing things individually? Pretty much, or grouping them based on, you know, fairly superficial things, maybe where they lived, or basic appearance. Linnaeus brought consistency. And crucially, he also formalized binomial nomenclature. Ah, the two-part names. Exactly, that two-part scientific name. Genus and species. Like Homo sapiens for us, or Vulpes vulpes, the red fox. Suddenly there was a universal language. Didn't matter if you called it a renard or a fuchse or a fox. Scientists everywhere knew Vulpes vulpes. Right, and the specific format, italics, genus capitalized, species lowercase, it feels so standard now. But yeah, a huge step for clear global communication in science. Absolutely. But importantly, this was all before Darwin, right? Before evolution was really understood and accepted. How did Darwin's ideas shake up this neat Linnaean system? Ah, yes, that's the next critical turning point. You see, the dominant view back then, when Linnaeus was working, was that species were fixed, immutable, created as they are and never changing. Right, static. Exactly. So the classification system reflected that idea of fixed types. Then, boom, 1859, Darwin publishes On the Origin of Species. And the key insight there is that life isn't static, it evolves, species change. They're connected by descent. It's a branching tree, not a fixed ladder. So this idea of rigid, separate boxes, these ranks, it must have started to feel a bit, well, artificial once you understand everything's connected through shared ancestry. Precisely. The system based on simple similarity or perceived difference started to clash with this new understanding of evolutionary relationships. People realized, wait, maybe why things are similar matters more than just that they are similar. And some groups caught on fairly quickly. You mentioned the American Ornithologists Union recognized this back in 1886. They did. The implications of evolution for classification were becoming clear. This paved the way for new thinking. You had figures like Willie Hennig, even back in 1866, suggesting maybe we should rank groups based on how long ago they originated. Based on their age. Interesting idea. Yeah, though that specific approach, ranking purely by age, turned out to have practical difficulties. Hennig himself realized that later. But it was a step towards thinking phylogenetically, thinking about evolutionary history. This eventually led to what we now call cladistics, really taking off in the second half of the 20th century. Okay, cladistics. What's the core idea there? The core idea of cladistics is classifying organisms based strictly on shared derived characteristics. We call them synapomorphies. Synapomorphies, okay. These are basically evolutionary innovations, new traits that evolved in a common ancestor and were passed down to its descendants. Finding these shared new traits is the key evidence for grouping organisms together because it points to a shared evolutionary path. It's about genealogy, essentially. So it's not just any shared trait like having wings because bats and birds have wings, but they didn't inherit them from a recent common winged ancestor, right? It's about those unique inherited innovations. Exactly right. You've hit on a key distinction. And then to really boost this approach came molecular systematics. Using DNA and RNA data. Precisely. Analyzing genetic sequences gives us this incredibly rich, independent data set to figure out evolutionary relationships. Sometimes the physical traits, the phenotype, can be misleading or just not informative enough, especially for microbes or groups that look very similar. DNA often cuts through that ambiguity. And you mentioned Hennig, the sort of father of cladistics, later cooled on the idea of fixed ranks. Yes, by 1969, he and others were arguing that maybe we should move away from insisting on these absolute ranks, like class or order. Because evolution is continuous, forcing groups into discrete boxes felt increasingly arbitrary from a purely evolutionary perspective. Which sort of brings us back to the ranks we actually use today. It seems like a bit of a blend then. The Linnaean structure is still there, but the thinking behind how we group things has shifted massively towards evolution. That's a good way to put it. The hierarchy itself is even expanded. The seven main ranks most people learn are domain, kingdom, phylum, well, or division in botany, class, order, family, genus, and species. And domain is the newest highest level, right? Relatively new, yes. R.T. Moore actually suggested dominion back in 74. But it was really Carl Woese's work in the late 20th, early 21st century that cemented the idea of three fundamental domains of life. Archaea, bacteria, and eukarya, based on fundamental cellular differences, especially ribosomal RNA. It's now widely accepted as the top tier. It's interesting though how these things take time to get formalized, even if the science points that way. Getting it officially into all the naming rules, the codes, can lag behind. Absolutely. You see that with domain and kingdom ranks finally being formally incorporated into the prokaryotic code just recently in 2023. Science moves and the formal systems adapt, sometimes slowly. And there are different formal systems, aren't there? Different rule books for naming things? Yes, that's another layer. We have the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the ICZN or just Zoological Code. The International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants, the ICN or Botanical Code. The International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes, ICMP or Prokaryotic Code. And rules for viruses too. Wow, okay. Why so many different codes? Well, historically, the study of animals, plants, and microbes developed somewhat independently, with their own traditions and specific challenges. An early attempt to unify rules, at least in zoology, was the Strickland Code back in 1842. But these different codes essentially regulate how names are formed, how they're published, what makes a name valid, and which name has priority if there are conflicts, specifically within their respective domains of life. And they have specific conventions within them, like the endings of names telling you the rank? Exactly. In zoology, for example, family names typically end in "-idae", like Hominidae for great apes. Superfamilies end in "-oidea". In botany, you see "-ae" for families like Rosaceae for the rose family, and "-ales" for orders like Rosales. These suffixes provide immediate information about the rank. And some codes are moving towards italicizing all scientific names, not just genus and species? Yes, the botanical code and the phylocode, which we should talk about, recommend or require italicizing names at all ranks now for consistency. Okay, but this brings us back to that issue Hennig raised. If evolution is continuous, how do scientists actually decide if a group is, say, a distinct family versus just a subfamily within another family? It sounds subjective. It absolutely involves subjectivity. How much difference or dissimilarity warrants a higher rank? There's no objective measure. This is a major critique of rank-based taxonomy, voiced not just by Hennig, but by many modern sysbiotists. And it's the main motivation behind phylogenetic nomenclature, most notably represented by the phylocode. The phylocode? Okay, so what is that and who's behind it? Key figures involved in developing and advocating for the phylocode include Kevin Dequeiros, Jacques Othier, Philip Cantino, Michel Laurent, and others. The fundamental idea is to ditch the requirement for obligatory ranks altogether
