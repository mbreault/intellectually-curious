## Description

In this episode, we dive into asteroid Bennuâ€”from OSIRIS-RExâ€™s 2020 sample return to the building blocks of life. We unpack the organic molecules found (amino acids and nucleobases), the hints of water, Bennuâ€™s rubble-pile structure, and the Yarkovsky drift that could have seeded worlds with life's ingredients. We also tackle planetary defense and what Bennu teaches us about the origins of life and the early solar system.

## Transcript

All right, so today we're going deep on asteroid Bennu. That's right. You sent over some pretty cool stuff too, it looks like. Wikipedia, scientific articles, even BBC News. Yeah, I wanted to cover all the bases, you know? For sure. So basically, we're going to unpack everything Bennu, right? Not just like the basic facts, but like what it tells us about the building blocks of life and all that. Exactly. And the really cool part is we're not just theorizing anymore. We've got actual pieces of Bennu here on Earth thanks to OSIRIS-REx. Okay, so before we get too deep into that, for anyone listening who maybe needs a refresher, what is Bennu? Like, paint us a picture. So picture this, a spinning top about 500 meters wide just tumbling through space. That's Bennu. But it's not like a smooth little rock. It's actually super rough, covered in boulders. Oh, wow. Really? So I guess landing a spacecraft on that wasn't exactly a walk in the park. You could say that the OSIRIS-REx mission definitely had its challenges, but they managed to touch down back in 2020 and grab a sample. Wow, that's just wild to think about. Holding a piece of an asteroid? Like a piece of the solar system's history. But okay, let's get to the good stuff. What did those Bennu samples actually reveal? Well, they're absolutely loaded with organic molecules. Okay. And not just any molecules. I'm talking amino acids, the things that make up proteins. Oh, wow. And even nucleobases, the components of DNA and RNA. Wait, hold on. So those are like the essential ingredients for life as we know it. You got it. And they're just out there on an asteroid. Pretty amazing, right? And what's even crazier is Bennu probably started way out in the main asteroid belt and then drifted closer because of this thing called the Yarkovsky effect. The Yarkovsky effect. I've always been fascinated by that. So it's more than just like a little push from sunlight. It is. Over millions of years, this thermal force can actually change an asteroid's entire trajectory. It can move them all over the place. So that means things in the asteroid belt could have ended up all over the solar system, carrying those building blocks of life with them, including Earth. Are we talking like the possibility that life on Earth got started because of asteroid impacts? That's a leading theory and Bennu's composition seems to back it up. Imagine early Earth just getting bombarded by asteroids carrying these essential ingredients. Whoa. That's a seriously different way to think about how life emerged. It is. Okay, so we've got organic molecules, but I remember reading something about water too. What's the story there? Oh yeah, scientists found minerals and salts in the samples that only form when saltwater evaporates. So does that mean there were like oceans on Bennu? Not quite. Probably more like salty pools or pockets of water existing for thousands of years, maybe even longer. But those organic molecules floating around in that water for eons, it's like a giant test tube for prebiotic chemistry. Okay, so that's like the processes that lead to life as we know it. Exactly. Mind-blowing. So those building blocks were scattered all over the early solar system. How many other Bennu's could be out there? You know, with the potential to start life on other worlds. It's a question that really changes how we think about where life could exist and how it might arise. We're not just looking at Earth anymore. We're looking at a universe that could be full of life. That's a humbling thought for sure. But okay, we can't talk about Bennu without talking about the elephant in the room, right? The chance of it hitting Earth. Right. Bennu is classified as potentially hazardous. The current calculations put the odds at about 1 in 2,700 for a potential impact in 2182. 2182. Okay, so that's a ways off. But still a little unnerving. What are the chances it would actually hit us? And what could we even do about it? Well, those calculations are based on what we know now, and they can change as we get more data. And that's where missions like OSIRIS-REx are so important. By studying Bennu, we're not only learning about the origins of life, but also getting crucial info for planetary defense. Right, so this isn't just about looking back billions of years. It's also about protecting our future. Exactly. Okay, so aside from the potential impact, are there any other concerns about Bennu? Like, is there anything else that makes it tricky to study or understand? Well, one thing scientists are really interested in is its activity. They've seen Bennu shooting out particles and rocks into space. Oh, wow. Like it's spitting stuff out? Why would it do that? We're not entirely sure yet, but it definitely adds another layer of complexity. So it's not just a spinning top. It's a dynamic and evolving space object. And one more thing about Bennu. It's not solid rock all the way through. It's actually super porous. Analyses suggest it's more like a giant rubble pile held together by gravity. A rubble pile asteroid. Yeah. That's both fascinating and kind of scary. It is. It makes you wonder how something like that could have survived for billions of years. And definitely raises some questions about how we go about deflecting it if we had to. Yeah, a rubble pile asteroid. It's not just like a big chunk of rock flying through space. That's kind of freaky. Right. Makes you think how it managed to stay together for billions of years. And if we ever had to deflect it, it wouldn't be so simple. I bet. So about those samples I was reading that they weren't all easy to get to right away. Something about stubborn fasteners. Oh, yeah. You did your homework. It's true. Two of the fasteners on the sampler head were kind of stuck. So they couldn't get to most of the sample right away. Wow. Took some serious work to finally open the capsule. Like Bennu was holding on to its secrets until the last minute. Uh-huh. I guess you could say that. But it was worth the wait. Those 120 grams of rock and dust have given us so much info. And we're still analyzing it. So we've got organic molecules, water, this weird structure. But what about the specific types of organic molecules? Are we talking like the same ones we find here on Earth? Well, they actually found 14 of the 20 amino acids that are essential for life as we know it. Oh, wow. And all five nucleobases that make up DNA and RNA. So it's not just random organic stuff. It's like the actual building blocks of life. Yeah. But wait, I think I read somewhere that Bennu's amino acids are a little different from Earth's. Something about handedness. You're right. Life on Earth uses mostly left-handed amino acids. But on Bennu, it's a 50-50 split, left and right. Huh. That's weird. Why is that? That's the million-dollar question. Scientists are still trying to figure out what caused that difference. Could be a huge clue about how life started. Wild. So this one asteroid could help us solve one of the biggest mysteries about life on Earth. But let's go back to Bennu's makeup for a sec. I read they've been comparing it to a specific type of meteorite we find here. Why is that? You're talking about CI chondrites. Yeah, CI chondrites. They're pretty rare, right? Super rare. But they're surprisingly similar to the Bennu samples. Both rich in carbon, water-altered minerals, even organic compounds. Okay, so what makes these CI chondrites so special? Why compare them to Bennu in the first place? Well, they're like time capsules from the very early solar system. Their composition is thought to be very close to the sun's, minus the hydrogen and helium, of course. Oh, so by comparing Bennu to these CI chondrites, scientists are basically getting a peek at the ingredients that formed our solar system. Exactly, like having two pieces of a puzzle that fit perfectly. Yeah. And it suggests that Bennu is a really pristine sample. Not much has changed since it formed. So we're looking at the building blocks of our solar system, untouched for billions of years. That's pretty incredible. It makes those samples even more valuable. It does. And it highlights why missions like OSIRIS-REx are so important. We can learn a lot from telescopes and stuff, but there's nothing like having an actual piece of space to study here in the lab. I can only imagine. Makes you wonder if those CI chondrites also have those same building blocks of life, you know, the amino acids and nucleobases. Do we know if they do? We do. Actually, CI chondrites have been found with various organic molecules, including amino acids. So it supports the idea that these building blocks were pretty common in the early solar system. Wow. So the early solar system was just teeming with the potential for life. That's incredible. But we can't forget about Bennu's potential impact on Earth. We've talked about the odds, but not really about what we could do about it. True. And that's where things get interesting. Remember how we talked about Bennu being like a rubble pile held together by gravity? Yeah. That makes deflecting it a lot more tricky. Oh, I bet. So the things we'd do for a solid asteroid wouldn't really work on Bennu. Exactly. It's not as simple as just nudging it. We have to think about what would happen if we hit it. Could break apart and create a bunch of smaller
