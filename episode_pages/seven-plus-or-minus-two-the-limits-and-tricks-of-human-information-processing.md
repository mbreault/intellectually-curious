## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. Today we're diving into a concept you might think you know, but probably don't. The magical number seven plus or minus two. Ah, yes, a classic from a 1956 paper by George A. Miller. Really made people think differently about how we perceive and judge information. And we've got excerpts from that very paper, along with some extra info, to help us unpack it all. So what was Miller actually getting at? Well, he was looking at what he called absolute judgments, our ability to categorize something, but like without any other context. Okay, so like if someone played a note on a piano, but you couldn't see the keys, could you tell what note it was? Exactly. Or imagine you taste something. No comparing. You just have to say how salty is it? That's an absolute judgment. Got it. So what did he find out about these judgments? This is the part that blows people's minds, even today. We're not as good at this as we think. Yeah, he reviewed tons of experiments, different senses, hearing, taste, vision, the whole works. The results were consistent. People could only tell the difference between, on average, six and a half categories, no matter what they were judging. Really? So like brightness of a light, saltiness, it all hits a wall around seven. Pretty much, yeah. Seems that there's a limit, like a ceiling, to how much variation we can really perceive and categorize when we're making these kinds of absolute judgments. Wild. Why seven, though? What's so special about it? Here's where we got to get a little technical, dip our toes into information theory. Oh, boy. Don't worry, it's not that bad. Miller uses the concept of bits of information. Basically, the tiniest units we can use to measure how much info a message has. Like each bit is a yes or no question, cutting possibilities in half. One bit, two choices, two bits, four choices, and so on. Okay, I see where this is going. So our brains can only handle about seven of those bits at once. Close, but there's a twist. Absolute judgments. Yeah, those seem limited by bits. But Miller found something super interesting when he looked at immediate memory. You mean like holding something in your mind for a short time? Right, short-term stuff. Turns out that's not limited by bits, but by the number of chunks we can hold. Chunks? Yeah, think of it like a meaningful unit of information. It could be one number, a letter, a whole word, even a familiar phrase. The point is, it makes sense together. Our brain sees it as one thing, even though that chunk might have a bunch of bits inside it. So judging loudness, that's limited by bits. But remembering things, it's how many of these chunks, not the total amount of info. You got it. And this is cool because it means we can kind of cheat the bit limit by grouping stuff together cleverly. Give me an example. Sure. Think about remembering numbers. We can usually hold about seven digits in mind. That's like 23 bits of information. But we can also remember about seven separate words, even though each word by itself has way more bits than a single digit. Because we're chunking? Chunking. It lets us get past that bit limit. It's like our brain is compressing the data, you know? Makes sense. So is that how those memory champions do it? Memorize crazy long numbers and stuff? Part of it, for sure. They train themselves to use really fancy chunking and recoding tricks, which we'll get into later. But it's not just for party tricks. This applies to how we learn any new concept, remember instructions, even understand what we're saying right now. Wow. So we're all chunking, like, all the time, without realizing it. All the time. Like when you remember a phone number by the area code or break down a big task into smaller steps. Chunking in action. And Miller talked about this amazing experiment that really shows how powerful this chunking or recoding can be. Okay, I'm all ears. Tell me about it. So researchers, they had people learn different ways to turn binary digits, you know, zeros and ones, into bigger chunks, like pairs, triplets, even bigger sets. And they'd give these chunks new names, basically recoding the information. So instead of remembering a meaningless string of ones and zeros, they were grouping them in a way that made more sense to them. Right. And the results were crazy. With practice, people could remember way more binary digits just by using these strategies. The better they were at recoding, the more they could remember. So we're not just stuck with whatever our brain starts with. We can train it to handle more by using these chunking and recoding things. That's one of the big ideas from Miller's work. It means even though we have limits, we're not just like passive sponges. We can change how we process and store information to get better. That's encouraging. But we've been talking mostly about judging one thing at a time and memory. What about the real world where stuff is way more complicated? Good point. Miller talks about that too. He says that magical number seven really applies when we're judging one thing, like how loud something is. But when we have multiple dimensions, things get more interesting. Multidimensional. Yeah, things that vary in more than one way. Like think about a dot in a square. It can move left, right, and up, down, right? So two dimensions. We can handle more categories then. Exactly. Research shows that when we add more dimensions, our capacity for making these judgments goes up. People can accurately pick out about 24 spots within a square, which is way more than the six or seven we see with just one dimension. So more complexity means more brain power. But I bet there's still a limit, right? You bet. It's not like adding dimensions just doubles our abilities. Even when judging two things at once, like saltiness and sweetness, people didn't get twice as good as just judging saltiness alone. Right. That makes sense. Okay, so more dimensions means more we can handle, but there's a ceiling somewhere. Exactly. And that leads to another question. What about things like faces or words or objects? Those vary in tons of ways. We can recognize hundreds of faces, thousands of words, way more than seven. True. How does that fit with this limit idea? Well, there's this super cool study Miller talks about. People listened to sounds that changed along six different dimensions, each dimension having five possible values. So a lot of different sounds. Over 15,000 possible combinations. Wow. How'd they do? Amazingly, they could handle it. They could tell apart about 150 different sounds perfectly. A huge jump from the six or seven categories we see in simpler judgments. So more dimensions can really boost what we can process, but I still feel like there's got to be a limit somewhere, even then. Of course. Even 150 is way less than the words or faces we recognize, and this is where Miller brings in something really neat, linguistics. Linguistics? Yeah, language. Linguists say the sounds we use in speech are different from each other because of about 8 to 10 distinctive features, like whether a sound uses your vocal cords or not, stuff like that. Kind of like those sounds in the experiment, but for how we talk. Exactly. And get this, when researchers used sounds that varied in eight dimensions, but only asked for yes-no judgments on each one, people could recognize about 120 sounds. That's pretty close to those distinctive features in speech. Right. It seems like there might be a limit around 8 to 10 dimensions for how much we can handle at once, even when the judgments are simple. But then the question is, how do we manage language, which is way more complex than just sounds? Yeah, we're not just identifying sounds all day. We put them into word, sentences, have whole conversations. Right, that's where sequential processing comes in. We're not doing everything at once. It's not like taking snapshots of each dimension one after the other, then putting those snapshots together to make sense of it all. Like our brains are juggling, but super fast. Kind of. It's this mix of doing things at the same time and in sequence that lets us go beyond those basic judgments and handle something as complex as language. That's amazing. So it's not just seven after all. Our brains have tricks to do even more. This is all so cool, but I'm ready to hear what this means for us in daily life. That's what we'll tackle next time. We'll explore the practical implications of Miller's work and how understanding these limits can help us learn, think, and solve problems better. Stay tuned. Welcome back to our deep dive into the magical number seven plus or minus two. You know, before we go on, I'm still kind of stuck on how our brains handle such complex stuff. We were talking about how more dimensions actually mean more processing power, even with those limits we discussed. Right, right. That study with the sounds varying across six dimensions. It's pretty mind-blowing that people could tell apart 150 sounds without messing up. Way more than the usual six or seven we see with those simpler judgments. Yeah, it really shows how much more our brains can do than we might think, especially when it's not just like comparing things on a single scale. For sure. Think about it. We're constantly bombarded with information that's changing in all sorts of ways. Like even just vision. It's not just about how big or what shape something is. We're processing color, texture, is it moving, what's around it. Our brains are taking in a whole lot of variables all the time. But if we're always hitting that seven-item limit, how do we manage? Well, this is
