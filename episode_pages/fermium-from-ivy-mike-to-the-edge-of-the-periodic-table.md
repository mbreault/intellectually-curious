## Description

Fermium is a synthetic, mystery-filled element born from the 1952 Ivy Mike hydrogenâ€‘bomb test and named for Enrico Fermi. In this episode we explore how scientists produce fermium in reactors via neutron bombardment, why itâ€™s so scarce and shortâ€‘lived (the most stable isotope has a halfâ€‘life of around 100 days), and what its chemistry looks like in solution and in compounds. Weâ€™ll dive into the Fermium gap that blocks heavier isotopes, why the element remains mainly a research curiosity, and how studying it helps illuminate the limits of nuclear stability. Finally, weâ€™ll peek at future workâ€”pushing beyond fermium with new accelerators and techniquesâ€”and the safety culture that makes handling such radioactive material possible.

## Transcript

Alright, ready to dive deep. Today, it's all about fermium. Fermium, huh? Yeah, fermium. This synthetic element that's, well, kind of mysterious. Definitely a bit of a mystery. Super hard to make, disappears quickly, you know the drill. Sounds right up our alley. And we're gonna figure out what makes it tick. Sounds like a plan. Using its Wikipedia page as our guide, of course. Alright, let's see what Wikipedia has to say. So first things first. First things first. Fermium, it's not just some, like, lab creation. It's connected to some major world events. Oh, that's interesting. I like where this is going. How many elements can you think of that are born from a hydrogen bomb? Hmm. I don't think I know of any. From a hydrogen bomb blast? You're kidding, that's how they found it. That's how they first found it. No way, you're pulling my leg. I'm serious. Okay, tell me more. I'm all ears. So we're talking about Ivy Mike. Ivy Mike. Yeah, the first hydrogen bomb detonation. Successful one, at least. Whoa. Scientists, they're looking through the fallout, right? Yeah, I'd imagine there's quite a bit of fallout. And bam, they find this brand new element. Amazing. And who do they name it after? Hmm, I wonder. Enrico Fermi. Of course. Yeah. Enrico Fermi, the nuclear physics legend. Exactly. It's not just any scientist that gets that honor, you know? That's gotta be for a good reason. I mean, his work with nuclear fission must have been incredible. Groundbreaking. Absolutely groundbreaking. Okay, that makes sense. It does. But hold on, hold on. What's up? If it's made in a hydrogen bomb explosion, doesn't that mean, like, it's just scattered everywhere? Yeah. How do scientists even get their hands on this stuff? You're not gonna find fermium just lying around. That's what I was thinking. It's synthetic, gotta make it, you know? We have to make it. We gotta make it. How do we do that? We're talking high-tech nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactors, huh? Bombarding lighter elements with neutrons, like plutonium. Wow. It's a process that really pushes the limits. I bet. That sounds way beyond anything I've ever done. Oh, for sure. But it makes you wonder, why go through all that trouble? I know what you mean. If it's so difficult to produce, what's the point? Right, what's the payoff? What can we even do with fermium? Well, the thing is, right now, fermium doesn't really have any practical uses. No practical uses. Not really, outside of research. Interesting. It's incredibly scarce. Super scarce. And it vanishes so fast. Vanishes. The most stable form, fermium-257. Okay. It has a half-life of about 100 days. 100 days, that's not very long. Not very long at all. So we can make it, but it's gone before we know it. Pretty much. God, it'd be frustrating for scientists. Oh, absolutely. It's a challenge, big challenge. But even if it doesn't stick around long, fermium gives us insights into how these heavy elements act. It does, valuable insights. It tells us about those super heavy elements. So it's useful in that way. Very useful. Like take the fermium gap. Ah, yes, the fermium gap. Scientists are having trouble making isotopes heavier than fermium-257. It's like hitting a wall, you know? Oh. Shows us the limits of what we can do. So even though we're not using it to build bridges or anything, fermium is helping us understand physics and chemistry better. Absolutely. I like that, pushing boundaries. Pushing boundaries, that's fermium. You mentioned that fermium gap. Yeah. Why can't they make those heavier isotopes? What's stopping them? It all comes down to stability. Stability. The heavier an element gets, the less stable. Interesting. Those heavier fermium isotopes, they undergo spontaneous fission, basically self-destruct. Self-destruct. Before we can really study them. Wow. So it's not just the half-life we're fighting. No. The element itself is fighting back. In a way, yeah. It's a real challenge. Okay, so we know about its origins, how it's made, and why it's mainly used for research for now. So far, so good. But what about its personality? Personality. Chemically speaking, what's going on at the atomic level? Ah, I see what you mean. The Wikipedia article says it mostly exists as FM3 plus ions in solution. That's right, like lots of heavier actinides. Okay. Fermium likes to be a plus three ion in solution. Right. But here's the interesting part. Yeah. It forms really strong bonds with some organic molecules. Oh, so even though it's not very practical in the real world, it's got its own thing going on in the chemical world. Exactly. Tell me more about these bonds. What's happening there? It's all about size. Size. Yeah, the FM3 plus ion, it's smaller than other actinide ions. Okay. It's because of its atomic structure. Interesting. This means it can get closer to those organic molecules, form those tight bonds. So because of its size, it bonds in this unique way, makes those strong connections. You got it. Stronger than its neighbors on the periodic table. Yes. Definitely a key takeaway about its chemistry. So it's not all just explosions and half-lives. There's some nuance there. Lots of nuance. And there's even evidence it can exist as a plus two ion sometimes. Yeah, it can form compounds like fermium-2 chloride. So it can change things up depending on where it is. That's right. That's pretty neat. It is, and it's all linked to where it sits on the periodic table. Ah, I see. If you compare fermium's behavior to other elements, like ytterbium, we start to see patterns that help us understand the bigger picture of the elements. The bigger picture, I like that. It all connects in the end. It's pretty amazing how we can learn so much from something so tiny and, well, temporary. That's the beauty of chemistry, I guess. It really makes you think about the power of these elements. Absolutely. Speaking of power, I have to ask. Shoot. Is working with this stuff dangerous? I mean, it came from a nuclear explosion. Yeah. And we're talking about radioactivity here. Right, so that's definitely a smart question. So is it dangerous? Okay, so fermium itself, it's not gonna, like, explode on you or anything. Okay, that's good to know. But it is radioactive. Radioactive. All its isotopes are. So that means... It means they release particles and energy as they decay. And that's bad. It can be, yeah. It can be harmful. Definitely not something to mess around with. No, definitely not. So how do scientists even work with it safely? Researchers who work with fermium and other similar elements, they have to take serious precautions. I bet. Like what? Special labs, sealed glove boxes, fume hoods, you know, the works. To contain it. To contain any radioactive material, yeah. Smart. Plus, there were protective gear. I was gonna ask about that. Like, what kind of gear? Gloves, respirators, that sort of thing. To avoid getting contaminated. Exactly. Gotta stay safe. It sounds intense, like being a scientist and an astronaut at the same time. Kinda. Exploring the unknown, but with all those extra safety measures. It makes sense. Yeah, there's always some risk in research. Of course. But with radioactive elements, that risk is amplified. For sure. The key is to minimize those risks as much as possible. How do they do that? Careful planning, proper training, and the right equipment. Sounds thorough. It has to be. And I guess the short half-life helps too, right? It does. It becomes less radioactive over time? Absolutely. Fermium's decay, it means the radioactive material decreases rapidly. That's gotta help. It definitely helps reduce long-term exposure. That makes sense. But there's a catch. Oh, what's the catch? Those decay products, they can also be radioactive. So it's not just the fermium itself. Yeah. It's like, it's children too. It's a chain reaction of caution. A chain reaction, wow. So careful handling is still really important. I bet. Gotta be extra cautious. Always. So scientists are always monitoring everything. Constantly. They're monitoring and adapting their procedures. To keep everyone safe. Everyone safe, that's the priority. Well, it's incredible work they're doing. It is. With such a challenging element like fermium. It really shows how far we've come. In understanding the universe. Absolutely. We're constantly learning and pushing the boundaries. And even if it doesn't have everyday uses right now? The knowledge we get from studying it is super valuable. Couldn't agree more. It's about expanding our understanding. Of matter and energy. Exactly. And who knows what that could lead to in the future? New breakthroughs, maybe. Oh, definitely. New discoveries are always on the horizon. That's exciting. Very exciting. Makes you wonder what's next for fermium research. It does, doesn't it? What are scientists hoping to do with it down the line? Well, one of the biggest things is creating those heavier isotopes. The ones beyond that fermium gap. Exactly. Pushing further into the unknown. Ambitious. How are they planning to do that? Scientists are always pushing the boundaries, right? They're looking at new techniques, new technologies. Okay, like what? Particle accelerators, for example. Particle accelerators. They can smash atoms
