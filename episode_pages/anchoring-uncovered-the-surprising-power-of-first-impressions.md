## Description

In this deep-dive episode, we unpack the anchoring effectâ€”from what an anchor is to why it skews judgments in everything from car shopping to salary negotiations. We'll review iconic experiments by Tversky, Kahneman, Ariely, and others, explore leading theories (anchoring and adjustment, selective accessibility, attitude change), and share practical strategies to spot and counter anchors in real life.

## Transcript

All right, so you're ready to dive deep. This time we're tackling the anchoring effect. Ooh, yeah, anchoring effect, that's a good one. It's kind of freaky when you think about it, how the first bit of info you get can totally mess with your decisions, even if it's completely random. Totally. Like, it doesn't matter if you're an expert or just starting out, it can still trip you up. For this deep dive, we've got a whole pile of research to go through. We've got stuff from Wikipedia, scientific papers, even real life stories about people buying houses, negotiating deals, you name it. That's what's wild about anchoring, it's everywhere. Okay, so first things first, what exactly is this anchoring effect? Most people think about numbers, but it's got to be more than that, right? Oh yeah, way more. It's not just about numbers, it's any starting point, any reference that kind of sets the stage for how you judge things later on. Like, imagine you're trying to buy a used car, right? Okay, yeah, I've been there. And the very first car you see has a price tag that's just ridiculous, way too high. Oh, I hate that. I just want to walk away right there. I know, right? But here's the thing, even though you know it's overpriced, that price is now stuck in your head, it's become an anchor. Makes sense. So the next car you look at, even if it's still expensive, might suddenly seem like a good deal compared to that first outrageous price. Just because that first one was so out there. So it's not really about math, it's more about how our perception gets all wonky. Exactly. And there's this other thing called end anchoring, where our brains tend to fixate on the first and last things in a series. Okay, I can see that, first impressions and all that. But how do we know this anchoring effect is for real? Is there actual proof it's not just like a coincidence? Oh, there's mountains of proof. It's not just some theory. Scientists have done tons of experiments to show exactly how this works. Like one of the classic ones is by these researchers named Tversky and Kahneman. They asked people to quickly calculate in just five seconds what 1 times 2 times 3 all the way up to 8 equals. Wait, hold on, gotta get my calculator. Just kidding. But yeah, that's a lot to figure out that fast. Right, but here's the twist. Some people saw the numbers written going up, like that, starting small. But others saw the exact same numbers, just in reverse, going down 8 times 7 times 6 and so on. So same answer either way, just flip the order. Exactly. But the results were crazy different. The folks who saw the numbers going up, starting small, they guessed way lower than the folks who saw them going down. We're talking like a difference of almost 2,000 in their estimates. Whoa, so just changing the order messed with their heads, even though the math was the same. That's wild. Yep. And they did this other experiment with a roulette wheel that really shows how random this anchoring thing can be. They had people watch this wheel, and it was rigged to stop on either the number 10 or 65. Totally random choice, right? Yeah, those numbers have nothing to do with each other. Right. But then they asked these people to guess the percentage of African countries in the United Nations. And wouldn't you know it, the folks who saw that roulette wheel land on 10 guessed way lower percentages than the folks who saw it land on 65. No way. So a random number from a spinning wheel somehow messed with their guess about something totally unrelated. Okay, this is starting to get a little freaky. Oh, it gets even weirder. There's this other researcher, Dan Ariely. He did this study using people's social security numbers. He asked them to write down the last two digits of their number and then think about whether they'd pay that much money for different stuff, like a bottle of wine or a cool gadget. Wait, so if my social security number ends in like 82, I'm going to be more likely to pay $82 for something than someone whose number ends in say 20? You got it. And the results were exactly that. People with higher two-digit numbers were willing to pay way more for the same stuff, even though those social security digits have nothing to do with the actual value. Okay, color me convinced. This anchoring thing is real, but also kind of terrifying. Does this mean we're all just making dumb decisions all the time without even knowing it? Well, the thing is, you can't just think your way out of this trap. Even when people are told about anchoring, they still fall for it. Like there was this study where they warned people about it, even offered them money if they adjusted their estimates correctly, and it barely made a difference. So even if I know about it, I'm still going to get anchored. That's frustrating. It's tough, but there is one strategy that seems to help the consider the opposite approach. So like if someone gives me a lowball offer, I should immediately think about all the reasons why it's actually worth way more. Bingo. Force yourself to think about the opposite of what that anchor is suggesting, and it can kind of break the spell. And here's the kicker, even ridiculously wrong anchors can mess with us. They did this experiment where they asked people whether Mahatma Gandhi died before or after a certain age. I'm guessing they didn't use his real age. Nope, they used crazy ages like 9 or 140. Obviously neither of those is even close, but the people who got the anchor of 9 guessed a much younger age of death for Gandhi than those who got 140. So even when we know the anchor's totally nonsense, it still sneaks in and affects our thinking. This is wild. It is, isn't it? And it shows just how powerful this anchoring effect can be. All right, so we've established that this anchoring thing is real, it's everywhere, and it can seriously mess with our heads. But where do we go from here? How do we fight back against this sneaky cognitive bias? We'll delve into that and more when we return for the next part of our deep dive. Stay tuned. Welcome back. Ready for more anchoring craziness? Oh, I'm hooked. Learning about this stuff is kind of like watching a magic show. You see the trick, but you still can't figure out how it's done. I know, right? It's both fascinating and frustrating. So you mentioned before that scientists are still scratching their heads about what exactly causes this anchoring effect. Yeah, it's still a bit of a puzzle. We see it happening everywhere. Tons of studies have proven it, but the why is still up for debate. So what are some of the top theories out there? Well, one of the leading ones is called anchoring and adjustment. The idea is that when we're given an anchor, our brains kind of use it as a starting point and then try to adjust from there. Like setting a baseline and then tweaking it. Exactly. But the problem is we tend to underadjust. We don't move far enough away from that initial anchor, even when we know it's probably wrong. It's like our brains get stuck in a rut, clinging to that first bit of info, even when it's leading us astray. Perfect analogy. Now, another interesting theory is selective accessibility. This one focuses on how the anchor actually affects the information we pull from our memories. So it's not just about adjusting a number, it's about how the anchor shapes our whole thought process. Exactly. Let's say you're trying to guess the price of, I don't know, a rare antique or something. If someone throws out a high anchor, like $10,000. Whoa, big money. Right. But your brain starts dibbing for memories that could justify that price. Like you might start thinking about other antiques you've seen, the craftsmanship, the history behind it. Exactly. And that selective retrieval of info basically strengthens the anchor, making you more likely to give a higher estimate. So the anchor isn't just biasing the number itself, it's biasing the whole way we think about the problem. Now you're getting it. And then there's the attitude change theory, which suggests that the anchor actually changes our attitude toward the whole subject. So, like, if I'm anchored to a high price, I might actually start to believe the item is worth more. Right. It's almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy. The anchor becomes a persuasive message, influencing our perception of value, quality, or whatever it is we're judging. It's like the anchor plants a seed in our minds and it grows into this belief, even if it started from something totally random. And that's where things get really interesting, because if our attitudes are changing, the effects of anchoring can stick around even after we've moved on from that initial situation. Wait, so the anchor's influence can linger even after it's gone? That's kind of spooky. It is. It shows just how deep this can go. Now, it's important to remember that these three theories aren't mutually exclusive. They could all be working together in different ways. So it's a whole tangled web of brain stuff going on. Exactly. And scientists are still trying to unravel it all. But even without a complete understanding of how it works, we can still learn to recognize and deal with the effects of anchoring. That's the good news, right? We're not just helpless puppets to this cognitive bias. Right. Knowledge is power. Once you know about it, you can start to catch yourself when it's happening. So like, if I'm in a salary negotiation and they hit me with a super low offer. You can remind yourself, okay, that's just an anchor. Don't
