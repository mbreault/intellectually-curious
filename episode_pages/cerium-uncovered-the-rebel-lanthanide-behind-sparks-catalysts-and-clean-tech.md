Join us as we explore cerium, the soft, silvery lanthanide with a secret identity: a +3/+4 oxidation state and an intermediate valence. We trace its 1803 discovery, its role in ferrocerium fire starters and catalytic converters, and its expanding reach in LEDs, energy tech, and medicine. We'll also discuss its potential for a greener future alongside supply-chain and environmental challenges, all drawn from Royal Society of Chemistry resources, Wikipedia, and historical overviews.

## Transcript

Welcome to another deep dive. This time we are diving into the element cerium. Sounds fascinating. And hopefully it will be. We're going to be using some excerpts from the Royal Society of Chemistry's periodic table website. Okay. Also a deep dive from Wikipedia. And there's a piece on the history of cerium that we'll be looking at. Sounds like fun. Yeah, and cerium I think you'll agree has some really interesting properties. Yes. That make it really stand out. It's true. Cerium is often categorized as one of those rare earth elements. But it's actually more abundant than tin or lead. More abundant than tin. That's pretty wild. Okay, so if you're just joining us, cerium is a soft silvery white metal. Right. It tarnishes really quickly in air. It's the second element in the lanthanide series on the periodic table. Yeah. And this location is actually kind of key to its unique behavior. Exactly. While most lanthanides have a predictable plus three oxidation state, cerium can be a bit of a rebel. It exhibits both plus three and plus four oxidation states. It's like cerium has a secret identity. It does. It's a chemical chameleon. So how was this two-faced element discovered? Well, picture this. The year is 1803, a time for some major scientific discoveries. Cerium makes its debut thanks to not one, but two separate teams of scientists. Young's Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in Sweden. And then Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who was working independently in Germany. Talk about a grand entrance. I know, right? So what's the story behind its name? Cerium was actually named after the asteroid Ceres, which had been discovered just a couple of years earlier. And Ceres itself was named after the Roman goddess of agriculture. So there's a cosmic connection between an element, an asteroid, and a Roman goddess. Exactly. That's pretty cool. But it seems like getting a pure sample of cerium metal wasn't exactly a walk in the park. Right, yeah. It took over 70 years after its initial discovery for scientists to isolate pure cerium metal. And they did that using electrolysis in 1875. That's a long time. I guess some elements like to play hard to get. Speaking of playing hard to get, let's talk about something a little more familiar, lighter flints. Okay. You know, the thing you flick to start a fire? Yes. Well, that spark is all thanks to cerium. That's right, yeah. Cerium is highly reactive, especially when it's in powdered form. When it's combined with iron to make what's called ferrocerium, you get those sparks that we all rely on. You know, if you're camping or you're in a survival situation, it's that same reaction that makes those fire starter tools work as well. Cerium, small but mighty. And this reactivity plays a role in a much less obvious place, your car's catalytic converter. Yes. So cerium's dual oxidation states come into play here. Cerium oxide, or as it's sometimes called,ceria, can actually store and release oxygen as needed, which helps to burn up unburnt fuel in the exhaust, which reduces those harmful emissions. So cerium is kind of like a tiny superhero cleaning up the air we breathe. And this is just one of its many amazing talents. You'll never guess where else you can find cerium hard at work. So before we took a break, we were talking about cerium's ability to store and release oxygen, making it a key player in reducing emissions in our car's catalytic converters. Yeah, and we were talking about how cerium has those two phases, right, those two oxidation states. Exactly, yeah. It's like cerium is always switching between these two different states. Okay, I'm intrigued. What happens? It never settles on just one. So is it not quite plus three and not quite plus four? You got it, yeah. Scientists call this an intermediate valence. It's kind of like, imagine you have a bus with seats. Okay. And each seat represents an electron. So in a classic plus four oxidation state, cerium would give up four of its electrons, leaving four empty seats. But in ceria, it's kind of like cerium is hopping on and off the bus, sometimes filling those seats, sometimes leaving them empty. So are those oxygen vacancies, like those empty seats we talked about, created by cerium's, you know, indecisiveness? Yeah, you got it. And this hopping is what makes ceria such a good oxygen storage and release agent. Those empty seats are ready and waiting for oxygen to come along and fill them up. Okay. Or for oxygen to jump off and go do its job in the catalytic converter. It's like cerium is playing musical chairs with oxygen. That's a great way to put it. It's amazing, this deep dive. It's making me see the periodic table in a whole new way. You know, it's not just this, like, static chart. It's like this dynamic system where all these elements are constantly, like, interacting and changing. Right, yeah. And those interactions are what give elements like cerium their unique and valuable properties. So with all these unique properties, what's next for cerium? Could it play an even bigger role in our future? Absolutely. Cerium is actually poised to be a key player in building a more sustainable world. Yeah. Think about its role in clean energy technologies. As we move towards things like electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles, the demand for these efficient catalytic converters will only increase. And ceria, with its remarkable oxygen storage capacity, is essential for these systems. So cerium is going to be, like, along for the ride as we move towards a greener future. Absolutely, yeah. What about other areas where cerium is making a difference? Well, you know those energy-efficient LED lights we all use? Yeah. Well, cerium-doped phosphors are what give those LEDs that, like, really crisp white light we've come to expect. Okay. As the world continues to embrace these energy-efficient lighting solutions, the demand for cerium will keep growing. So it's like cerium is, like, this silent hero helping us reduce our environmental impact. It is, yeah. What else? Scientists are also exploring cerium's potential in some cutting-edge fields like solar energy and fuel cells. Yeah, ceria's ability to easily switch between those oxidation states, grabbing and releasing oxygen as needed, you know, makes it an exciting candidate for boosting the efficiency of these technologies. So an element discovered over 200 years ago in a Swedish mine could help us solve some of today's biggest energy challenges. Right. Wow. And that's not all. Cerium oxide nanoparticles are also being investigated for their potential in medicine. Really? Yeah. Some studies show that these nanoparticles can actually act as antioxidants, protecting our cells from damage. Wow. They even show promise in delivering medications directly to where they're needed in the body. So from cleaning up car exhaust to delivering, you know, life-saving medications, cerium has a knack for making a positive impact. It really does, yeah. Okay, so... You know, it makes you wonder what other amazing discoveries are waiting to be made in the realm of elements. We've been on quite a journey with cerium today, you know, from its humble beginnings in a Swedish mine to its potential role in, like, a sustainable future. But I guess, like anything, there's two sides to this coin. So while cerium offers all these incredible possibilities, there's some challenges too, right? Right. As we become, you know, more reliant on cerium for clean energy and other things, we need to think about where it comes from and the impact its production has. So it's not just about celebrating cerium's superpowers. Right. It's also about how we source it and use it responsibly. Exactly. What are some things to keep in mind? Well, most cerium production is really concentrated in a few specific places. Okay. Like China. Okay. And this, you know, could create some vulnerabilities in the supply chain as demand increases. Yeah, that makes sense. So you need to, like, diversify our sources to make the supply chain more stable. Exactly. What about, you know, the environmental impact of all this? Yeah. That's another important thing to consider. You know, extracting and refining cerium can have environmental consequences if it's not done the right way. Okay. It often involves using, you know, strong chemicals, and it can generate a lot of waste. So sustainable mining practices, waste reduction, recycling, all super important. Are there any efforts, you know, to address these concerns? There are, yeah. There's a lot of interest in developing better ways to extract and process cerium and finding ways to recycle and reuse this valuable element. So it sounds like we're at a point where we need to balance cerium's incredible potential with, you know, responsibility. I agree. It's all about using the power of these elements in a way that benefits everybody. This deep dive has been amazing. It has been fun, yeah. It really has. It's made me appreciate cerium and really all these elements. I agree, yeah. Who knew something so simple as an element could have such a huge impact from, you know, sparking a lighter to maybe revolutionizing clean energy and medicine? It's pretty incredible. Yeah. Who knows what else is out there to be discovered? Exactly. Well, that brings our deep dive into cerium to a close. We covered a lot today, you know, from its fiery sparks to its potential to light up a more sustainable future. We also talked about, you know, the importance of sourcing cerium responsibly and using it in a way that benefits, you know, both humanity and the planet. Yes. Thanks for listening.
