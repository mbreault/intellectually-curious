## Transcript

Hey, welcome back for another deep dive. This time we're going all the way to the end of the actinite series, to Lorenzium. Lorenzium. Element 103. A synthetic element, which means, of course... Not found in nature. Not found in nature, and it's radioactive, too. And, of course, it's named after... Ernest Lawrence. Ernest Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron, who... I mean, what a fascinating story. Yeah. Just to think about how... It really is. You know, to synthesize an element like Lorenzium, it's almost like... I always imagine it as like trying to build a tower out of incredibly slippery magnetic blocks. Oh, wow. You know, so the heavier the element is, the more these blocks, which are the protons in the nucleus, repel each other. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. So how do they even create these super heavy elements, then? Well, they use these incredible machines called particle accelerators, which smash lighter elements together near the speed of light. Oh, wow. So you're taking, you know, two atoms and just slamming them together, hoping that they'll stick. Wow. So what are the odds of that fusion actually occurring? The odds are incredibly slim. You know, it's a very delicate dance of energy and timing to actually get them to fuse. It sounds almost impossible. And then even if they create it, it doesn't last very long. Right, exactly. You know, even if you manage to create a new element, it often exists for just a fleeting moment before it decays. Okay. And that brings us to a fascinating period in scientific history, what's often referred to as the Transfermium Wars. Ooh, I love a good name like that. What are the Transfermium Wars? So this was during the Cold War. Okay. And the Cold War rivalry really spilled over into the world of super heavy element research. So you had, you know, the US and the Soviet Union locked in this very intense competition to synthesize and name new elements. So it wasn't just about scientific discovery. It was also about, like, national pride. Right. Oh, absolutely. This was, you know, this was a battle for scientific prestige. Wow. And Lorenzium, or element 103, became a focal point in this. So who were the main players in these Transfermium Wars? So you had the team at Berkeley Lab in the US, and you had the scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, which is in the Soviet Union. Okay. And both teams were confident that they had synthesized Lorenzium first. Oh, so there were conflicting claims. Like, were they publishing papers? Absolutely. It was a very, you know, there were scientific papers fired back and forth, kind of like intellectual missiles almost. That's amazing. So how did this scientific showdown eventually resolve? Did anyone claim victory? It took decades, actually. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. Oh, the IUPAC. The referees of the chemical world, right? They finally stepped in and, in a diplomatic move, acknowledged both teams as co-discoverers of element 103 in 1992. So they did retain the name Lorenzium, but they did change the symbol to L-R instead of Berkeley's proposed L-W. Oh, okay. So it was a bit of a kind of a compromise. Yeah, yeah, a little bit of a compromise there, but at least it recognized the contribution of both teams. Okay, so besides this whole scientific rivalry, what makes Lorenzium so interesting, so special from like a purely chemical standpoint? Well, you know, Lorenzium is fascinating because it kind of sits at this intersection of two groups of elements. You have the actinides, and then you have the group 3 transition metals. It's almost like it's trying to decide which family it belongs to. Oh, okay, so tell me more about this kind of, this identity crisis that it seems to have. Well, chemically, Lorenzium behaves very similarly to its counterpart in the lanthanide series, which is lutetium. Okay. So they both have a tendency to lose three electrons, forming what we call a plus three charge when they react. But their electron arrangements, or what we call their configurations, tell a slightly different story. Okay, so I'm sensing a curveball coming here. What's going on? Exactly. So, you know, you can picture electrons as kind of fitting into these specific slots, or what we call orbitals around an atom. Okay. Now, based on its position on the periodic table, you would expect Lorenzium's final electron to land in what is called a day orbital, just like lutetium. But guess what? It prefers a P orbital instead. So it's breaking the pattern, kind of like a rebellious teenager. That's a great way to put it. And this kind of defiance of expectations has really puzzled scientists for quite some time. So what does this mean for Lorenzium's behavior? Does it actually act differently because of this configuration anomaly? That's the fascinating part. Despite this deviation, Lorenzium's chemistry remains incredibly similar to lutetium. Oh, wow. So it kind of raises all these questions about, you know, how these electron configurations actually translate into, you know, real-world chemical behavior. So I guess even though we have these, like, neat and tidy models and we think we know how things work, nature always finds a way to kind of... Absolutely. It's a reminder that even in a field that seems as kind of well-defined as chemistry, there are still so many mysteries to unravel, deeper layers to understand. This deep dive is already blowing my mind, and we haven't even gotten to the island of stability yet. That just sounds like something straight out of, like, you know, a science fiction novel. It does have a certain ring to it, doesn't it? It really does. But it's a very real concept in nuclear physics. Okay. And it's closely tied to our quest to create even heavier elements. So essentially, it's a theoretical region on what's called the chart of nuclides, where superheavy elements, which are normally incredibly unstable, might have surprisingly long lifespans. Oh, okay. Yeah. So where does Lorenzium fit into all of this? Well, most of the Lorenzium isotopes that we've created have very short half-lives. You know, they decay rapidly. But there's one Lorenzium 266 that has a half-life of about 11 hours. 11 hours. Yeah. And that's long. In the realm of superheavy elements, that's practically an eternity. Wow. Okay. So even just this, like, slightly longer lifespan is significant in this context. Like, it's a hint that maybe we're on the right track towards this island. Exactly. It's like, you know, while Lorenzium itself might not be on the island, its properties kind of offer these valuable clues about the region's existence and what we might find there. Okay. You see, the stability of a nucleus is governed by, you know, a very complex interplay of forces. Okay. Break that down for me. What forces are we talking about here? So imagine the nucleus as this bustling city, right? And the protons are like the residents who all want their own space. And as more and more residents move in, so the city becomes more and more dense, right? That's right. The repulsion between them increases. Okay. So too many residents, too much repulsion, and things start to kind of... Things start to fall apart. Yeah, yeah. You know, that's what happens with, you know, a lot of these superheavy elements. They're just not stable. Right. But the island of stability theory suggests that at certain what we call magic numbers of protons and neutrons, this urban sprawl, so to speak, can reach a stable equilibrium. It's like finding the perfect layout that allows everyone to coexist peacefully. Oh, I see. So it's about finding the right combination of protons and neutrons to achieve this, like, harmonious nuclear city. Precisely. And theoretical calculations suggest that this island of stability might exist, you know, around element 114 or 120. Oh, wow. Or perhaps even further out. So if Lorenzium is like, you know, a coastal city that's kind of hinting at the existence of an island out there, how do we actually get to the island? How do scientists use this element as a springboard to reach these heavier elements? Well, think of Lorenzium as a base camp, right, from which explorers set out to reach these distant shores. So they use it as a target in particle accelerators, bombarding it with beams of, you know, carefully selected lighter elements, hoping to fuse them and create, you know, even heavier elements. So it's a really, really delicate and challenging process. But every step forward adds to our understanding. Exactly. Of this crazy world. Yeah. I think we need to take a short break. Okay. We'll be right back with more of this deep dive into Lorenzium. So we've talked about how Lorenzium can act as this launch pad, right, to reach even heavier elements. It's pointing us towards this elusive island of stability. It really is. It's fascinating how this element that, you know, as we've established, isn't even found in nature, it's man-made, can actually guide us towards these new discoveries, potential discoveries. So if we kind of zoom out a little bit, what is the bigger picture here? Why are scientists so eager to reach this island of stability? What's the big payoff? Well, the potential discoveries and applications associated with these super heavy elements are truly mind-boggling. You know, just imagine elements with properties that we've never encountered before. You know, materials with
