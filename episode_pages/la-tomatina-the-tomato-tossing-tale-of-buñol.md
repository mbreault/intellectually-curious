## Transcript

All right, buckle up, everyone, because today we're diving headfirst into a world of tomato mayhem. That's right, we're talking La Tomatina. La Tomatina, the world's biggest food fight. A massive tomato battle in a small Spanish town. It sounds like absolute chaos. It is glorious, messy chaos. And we're going to dig into everything about it. From its humble beginnings to its global fame, we're covering it all. Using good old Wikipedia as our guide. So what exactly is La Tomatina? Well, imagine this. Thousands of people. Okay, got it. Thousands of people. Armed with ripe tomatoes. I'm liking where this is going. In a town square in Spain. Spain, the land of siestas and tomato fights. Precisely. For one hour, it's a free-for-all of tomato throwing, squishing, and, well, general mayhem. Sign me up. But how did this all begin? You know, it's surprisingly recent. We're not talking about some ancient ritual here. So no centuries-old tomato throwing tradition. Nope, it all started in the 1940s. Really? The 1940s. That's pretty recent for something so iconic. It's a fascinating story, actually. Picture this. Bunol, Spain, 1945. Okay, I'm picturing it. Bunol, Spain, 1945. What's happening? A parade is going through the town square. Okay, a parade. I love a good parade. And there are these giant figures. You know, the ones with the oversized heads? Oh, yeah. Those things are always a bit creepy, but in a fun way. Well, as the story goes, one of those big heads went tumbling off. Wait, seriously? Someone lost their giant head? Yeah, and apparently the person inside wasn't too happy about it. They started lashing out, hitting anything in sight. I mean, I can't say I blame them. That's got to be frustrating. And as luck would have it, there was a vegetable stall nearby. Overflowing with, you guessed it, tomatoes. Oh, no. This is where the tomato carnage begins, isn't it? It is. People started throwing tomatoes at each other, and, well, the rest is history. So it all started with a parade mishap and some conveniently located tomatoes. That's the legend, at least. Talk about a recipe for a food fight. And this one tomato throwing incident just turned into a whole festival. Well, not immediately. The following year, some locals, clearly inspired by the chaos, decided to recreate it. So it wasn't an official thing at first, just a group of friends reliving the tomato throwing glory? Yeah, pretty much. They brought their own tomatoes and just went for it. I bet that didn't go over well with the authorities. You're right. They weren't thrilled. In fact, La Tomatina was actually banned for a while in the early 1950s. Banned? Seriously? Why would they ban a harmless tomato fight? Well, officially it was because it lacked any religious significance. Oh, right. That was a big deal back then. But I suspect the mess might have played a role, too. I mean, can you imagine the cleanup? Tomatoes everywhere? It must have been quite a sight. So what happened? Did the people of Bunyol just accept the tomato ban? Absolutely not. They came up with a pretty ingenious protest. Okay, I'm intrigued. What did they do? Did they start a petition? Stage a sit-in? They held a tomato funeral. A tomato funeral? I'm not sure I'm following. They paraded a giant tomato through town in a coffin, complete with a somber funeral march. Okay, that is brilliant. They mourned the loss of their beloved tomato fight. It worked. The authorities caved, and in 1957, La Tomatina was officially recognized as a festival. Talk about a victory for tomato enthusiasts everywhere. But it was still a pretty local affair, right? When did it start attracting the international crowds? Well, things really exploded in the late 1970s. A Spanish television program, Inform Semanal, did a whole report on La Tomatina. Ah, the power of media. It's amazing how a little bit of exposure can turn a local event into a global sensation. It's true. That TV report basically catapulted La Tomatina into the national spotlight. And from there, the tomato-loving tourists started flocking to Bunyol. You got it. People from all over Spain, and eventually from all over the world, started making their way to this little town to participate in the tomato madness. So from a banned local squabble to a nationally televised spectacle, La Tomatina's journey is already pretty remarkable, but it didn't stop there, right? You're right. In 2002, La Tomatina received further recognition. Oh, I bet this is when it hit the big time, internationally. Exactly. It was declared a fiesta of international tourist interest by the Spanish government. Wow. A fiesta of international tourist interest. That's quite the title. It basically cemented La Tomatina's status as a major cultural event, a must-see for tourists from all corners of the globe. It's amazing to think that this quirky, tomato-filled celebration went from being banned to being a globally recognized event. But what does that look like today? How many people are we talking about here? Today, over 20,000 people descend upon Bunyol for La Tomatina. Wow, 20,000 people. This little town must be absolutely packed. It is. Imagine it. A town square overflowing with tomato pulp, people covered from head to toe in red, the air thick with the scent of tomatoes. It sounds like a sensory overload in the best possible way, but I'm guessing there's more to La Tomatina than just showing up and letting the tomatoes fly. Oh, you're absolutely right. There's a whole buildup to the main event. Okay, so it's not just about the tomato fight itself. There's a whole pre-game ritual. Exactly. It all starts days before the actual tomato fight with a paella cooking competition. Paella. Okay, that's a pre-game I can get behind. Food and festivities, what's not to love? And then there are tomato-themed fireworks illuminating the night sky. Tomato-themed fireworks? That's incredible. There's music, parades, dancing. The whole town comes alive with anticipation. So it's a week-long party leading up to the main event. It's a celebration of all things tomato. Okay, now you've got me really excited about this. But what about the day of the fight itself? What happens right before the tomatoes start flying? Ah, that's when they have this unique tradition called the Palo Jab√≥n. Palo Jab√≥n? That sounds intriguing. What is it exactly? It's basically a tall, greased pole with a prized ham perched at the very top. A greased pole with a ham. Okay, that's definitely not what I was expecting. Hundreds of people try to climb this slippery pole. Wait, so they're all scrambling over each other trying to grab this ham, while covered in grease? And getting drenched with water from hoses. Okay, now this is starting to sound like pure chaos. What's the significance of this? Why a ham? Why a grease pole? It's all about the challenge, the anticipation. One final burst of messy fun before the real fun begins. I guess it's a good way to get everyone warmed up for the tomato battle. Plus, who doesn't love a good ham? True that. So once someone finally conquers the slippery pole and claims their prize, is that when the tomato fight officially begins? We got it. The fall of the ham signals the start of the tomato fight. And then, all bets are off. Exactly. Trucks piled high with ripe tomatoes arrive in the town square. And the tomato throwing frenzy begins. But wait, amidst all this chaos, are there any rules to this tomato madness? Oh, there are definitely rules. You can't just go in there swinging wildly. Really? Rules for a giant food fight, I wouldn't have guessed. For example, you have to squash the tomatoes before throwing them. Oh, that makes sense. Safety first, even in a tomato battle. And you can't rip anyone's clothes. Okay, yeah, that seems like a good rule to have in place. No tomato-stained wardrobe malfunctions. What else? I'm curious what other rules govern a tomato fight. Well, the fight ends promptly at the sound of a second pistol shot. A pistol shot? That's a pretty dramatic way to end a food fight. It's all about keeping things safe and controlled. Which, considering we're talking about a massive tomato battle, is probably for the best. It really is. They've got it down to a science, ensuring everyone has a blast while staying relatively safe. So when the pistol fires, everyone drops their tomatoes and it's all over. What happens then? I'm picturing a town square that looks like a tomato processing plant exploded. It's quite a sight, that's for sure. But then the fire trucks come in, hosing down the streets, washing away the tomato debris. Oh, man, I bet that feels amazing after being in the thick of the tomato battle. But seriously, how do they even clean up that much tomato? It must take days. You'd be surprised. Tomatoes have a secret weapon. Citric acid. Wait, so they clean up the tomatoes with tomatoes? Exactly. The citric acid acts as a natural cleaning agent. So after a good hosing down, the town square is surprisingly clean. That's amazing. I never knew tomatoes were so multi-talented. They are. But the impact of La Tomatina goes far beyond cleaning the streets of Bunyol. It's become a global phenomenon. Right. We touched upon this earlier, how it went from a local event to a global sensation. But how did that happen? How did La Tomatina capture the world's attention? Well, it's
