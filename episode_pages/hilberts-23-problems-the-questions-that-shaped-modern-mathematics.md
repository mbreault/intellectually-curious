## Description

A concise tour of David Hilbertâ€™s 23 problems, presented in 1900 to guide the future of math. We explore the bold ideas behind key problemsâ€” from the 3rd problem on dissecting shapes to the enduring mystery of the Riemann hypothesis (problem 8), the dream of describing all physics with math (problem 6), and the question of a universal algorithm (problem 10)â€”and how they sparked entire new theories, exposed the limits of solvability, and reshaped our understanding of mathematics.

## Transcript

All right, so you wanted to deep dive into Hilbert's problems. Yeah. And let me tell you, this is going to be a fascinating one. It is. We're talking about 23 problems presented by mathematician David Hilbert. Right. Back in 1900. Wow. These weren't just homework assignments, you know. They were meant to guide, like, future math research. Yeah, it's amazing to think about it, a list of problems shaping, like, an entire century of mathematical discovery. It really is. Some of these problems were solved, like, relatively quickly. Right. Others took decades of just intense work. Yeah. And some, oh well, some are still stumping mathematicians to this day. It's incredible. So imagine yourself back in 1900. Okay. The dawn of a new century. New century. There's this, like, electric feeling in the air. Science is on the verge of breakthroughs. Absolutely. And in the world of mathematics, there's this palpable buzz of excitement. Hilbert stepped on the stage at the International Congress of Mathematicians. Okay. And presented these 23 problems, carefully chosen. His idea was that the solutions to these problems would unlock entirely new areas of mathematics, revealing hidden connections and pushing the boundaries of what we knew. And some of them really did just that. They did. Take problem number three, for example. Okay, number three. It sounds pretty straightforward at first. All right. Can you take one shape, cut it up into pieces, and perfectly reassemble those pieces into a totally different shape? You might think, like, sure, why not? Yeah. But the answer turned out to be no, you can't always do that. Whoa. And one of the most surprising discoveries was that you can't transform a regular tetrahedron, a pyramid with four triangular faces, into a cube using this cut and reassemble method. So that's what I love about this. Yeah. The answer is unexpected. It is. It really makes you think. It's like these problems are full of hidden surprises. Absolutely. And speaking of surprises, let's talk about the one that really captured Hilbert's imagination. Problem number eight. Problem eight. The infamous Riemann hypothesis. Ah, the Riemann hypothesis. This one has been a real head-scratcher for mathematicians for over a century. Over a century. It delves into the world of prime numbers, those numbers that are only divisible by one and themselves. Right. Essentially, it's all about trying to find a hidden pattern in the way prime numbers are distributed. And the fact that it's still unsolved after all this time just adds to the mystery, right? It does. I mean, Hilbert himself said that if he were to wake up 1,000 years in the future, the first thing he'd ask is if the Riemann hypothesis had been solved. Really? That's how much this problem captivated him. Hilbert really believed in the power of math to unlock the secrets of the universe. Yeah. And that unwavering belief is evident in so many of his problems, like problem number six, for example. Okay, what's number six? This one asks whether we can describe all of physics using math. Whoa. So we're not just talking about equations for gravity or electricity here. But like literally everything in the universe. Everything. It really gets at this question of whether math is just a tool we use to describe the world or if it's somehow woven into the very fabric of reality. Now, as we dive deeper into these problems, you'll see just how varied they are. They are. Some dealt with pure numbers. Right. Others focused on geometry. Yeah. And some, like problem number six, really blurred the lines between mathematics and other fields like physics. And what's fascinating is that Hilbert believed every single one of these problems could be solved. Really? He had this unshakable faith in human ingenuity. Wow. But ironically, his own list would eventually challenge that belief in a very profound way. Okay, now you've got me really intrigued. Yeah. What happened? What could shake Hilbert's faith in the solvability of all mathematical problems? Let's just say Hilbert's problems led to some truly groundbreaking. Okay. And perhaps even unsettling discoveries about the very nature of mathematics itself. All right, well, I am definitely hooked. But before we jump into the next batch of Hilbert's mind benders. Right. I want to hear from you, the listener. Yes. What's standing out to you so far? Yeah. Which problem has you the most intrigued? Right. Let us know, because trust me, we've only just begun our exploration of these fascinating mathematical challenges. We have. It's remarkable how Hilbert's problems acted as, like, springboards for entirely new areas of mathematics, even those that remained unsolved. Oh, wow. Like, take problem hashtag 10, for instance. Ooh, what was that one about? It asked if there's a way, a step-by-step process to figure out if any equation you can dream up has a solution with whole numbers. So, like, a universal equation solver. Exactly. That's like something out of a sci-fi movie. But here's the twist. Okay. The answer, which came decades later, turned out to be no. Oh, wow. There's no such magical algorithm. So even improving something was impossible. Hilbert's problem led to a breakthrough. Absolutely. It had huge implications for what we understand computers can and cannot do. Yeah. It's a great example of how these problems weren't just about finding answers. Right. But about pushing the boundaries of mathematical thought itself. It's really making me rethink how I view math. Right. It's not just about formulas and calculations. It's about these deep questions about what's possible, what's knowable. Precisely. And some of those questions were answered in pretty surprising ways. Oh, okay. Remember when we talked about problem hashtag 7? Uh-huh. And those transcendental numbers? Now, transcendental numbers? Yeah. That sounds intimidating. It can be. But I think I get the gist. It's like they exist on a different plane than our everyday numbers. You're on the right track. Okay. Think of it like this. Most numbers we deal with, like whole numbers, fractions, even decimals, can be expressed as roots of equations. Okay. We call those algebraic numbers. Right. But transcendental numbers, like pi or e, they can't be pinned down that way. They're rebels, forever going on infinitely without repeating. They're kind of like the wild cards of the number world. I like that analogy. Thanks. Now, problem hashtag 7 asked, what happens when you take an algebraic number and raise it to an irrational power? Okay. Will you always get a transcendental number? Hmm. That's getting a bit complex for my non-mathematician brain. It is. What's the verdict? The answer is a resounding yes. Oh, wow. Thanks to the work of brilliant mathematicians like Alexander Gelfond, we now have a theorem that confirms this, a cornerstone of number theory. So Hilbert's problems sparked a whole new theorem. It did. That's pretty awesome. It is. And I'm guessing this wasn't the only problem that led to these kinds of breakthroughs. Not at all. Really? Remember problem hashtag 3? Uh-huh. The one about cutting shapes and reassembling them? Yeah. Well, that led to the development of din invariance. Okay, you lost me again. Okay. So what now? Think of them as special tools that help mathematicians analyze geometric figures. It's like having a set of measuring instruments to figure out the properties of a shape. But instead of measuring length or width... Right. They're measuring something more abstract. So it's like Hilbert's problems were these seeds that grew into these massive trees of mathematical knowledge. Good analogy. I'm sensing a but coming, though. You're right to sense that not all of Hilbert's problems were home runs. Oh. Some, like problem hashtag 4, turned out to be, like, too vague. What was problem hashtag 4 all about? It asked mathematicians to find all the possible geometries where the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Yeah. I mean, a straight line is the shortest distance, isn't it? That's what we usually think. Right. But as mathematicians dug deeper, the very definition of geometry started to expand. Okay. It turned out Hilbert's original wording didn't quite capture the complexity of the concept. So it's like he was asking them to map a territory that was constantly shifting and changing. Exactly. And then there's problem hashtag 6. The one about describing all of physics with math. Right. It ran into trouble because, well, physics itself went through a revolution in the 20th century. Oh, right. Quantum mechanics came along and, like, shook things up. Ah! So it's not that these problems were bad or unimportant. No. But rather that the landscape of mathematics and physics shifted in ways Hilbert couldn't have predicted. Precisely. And that, I think, is a valuable lesson in itself. Yeah. It reminds us that even the brightest minds are working within the context of their time. Right. Knowledge is always evolving. Yeah. And sometimes the questions we ask have to evolve along with it. I'm really starting to see the brilliance of Hilbert's vision here. It wasn't just about getting the right answers. It was about asking the right questions. Right. Questions that would push the boundaries of human understanding. Yeah. Even if they didn't have neat and tidy solutions. Absolutely. It's about the journey of exploration. It is. The challenge of pushing the limits of what we know. Right. But we've only scratched the surface here. We have. And there's one more piece of this puzzle that I'm really curious about. Okay. We talked earlier about Hilbert's unwavering faith in the solvability
