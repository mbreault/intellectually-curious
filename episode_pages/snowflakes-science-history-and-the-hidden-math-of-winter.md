## Transcript

All right, so get ready because we are going to take a deep dive into the world of snowflakes. Oh, this will be fun. You guys sent in a ton of articles and research on this. A lot of interest. Yeah. It seems like you were fascinated by everything from how they form to the math behind them. Oh, yeah, and the history too, right? Definitely some history in there for sure. Cool. So I guess let's start with like the super basic question. Okay. What even is a snowflake? Yeah. And like how does it even form? Yeah. I know it's not just a frozen raindrop, right? Right, that's hail. Yeah. Exactly. Hail forms when you have like super cooled water droplets and they freeze onto some kind of nucleus, but a snowflake. It's a little bit more magical, you know? They form when water vapor in the atmosphere, it kind of bypasses that whole liquid stage and goes straight from vapor to ice. Oh, wow. And that creates those really crazy shapes we see. So they just skip the whole raindrop phase. Exactly. Precisely. Wow. And so as these little tiny ice crystals are falling through the atmosphere, they encounter all these different like temperatures and humidity levels. And these kind of changing conditions cause more water molecules to freeze onto the crystal and it just adds and adds and adds to the structure. So that's how they get so complex. It's how they get so complex, exactly. So I've heard that like no two snowflakes are alike. Right. Is that actually true? That's a claim that has captivated people like forever. Really? And the science says, yeah, it's probably right because the atmospheric conditions each snowflake runs into is so varied. Yeah. The chances of two of them forming in exactly the same way. Yeah. Incredibly slim. So each snowflake is like a little unique fingerprint. Yeah, like a tiny little fingerprint falling from the sky. That's incredible. It's pretty remarkable. And it's been intriguing people for a long time. Oh, yeah, for a really long time. I mean, we have records back to like Johannes Kepler, Rene Descartes, marveling at the symmetrical beauty of snowflakes. Didn't Robert Hooke make some of the first drawings of snowflakes? He did. I think he was in like the 17th century or something. Yeah, he was like this polymath, right? Yeah. And he's using a microscope. And he was able to capture those intricate structures and drawings. And they were remarkably accurate for the time. And that helped propel further scientific study. Oh, absolutely. So, I mean, eventually someone had to take the first photograph of a snowflake. They did. So who was that? That was Wilson Owen Bentley, a farmer from Vermont. Wait, a farmer? Yeah, he was totally captivated by them. He was captivated by the science and the beauty. He saw them as these like tiny miracles of nature. Wow. And he spent years perfecting his technique. He combined a camera with a microscope to capture those intricate details. Wow. And his dedication, it paid off because he ended up taking over 5,000 photographs of snowflakes over his lifetime, yeah. That's amazing. It is. I bet his work really helped pave the way for more in-depth study. Oh, it did, yeah. And his photos gave scientists so many valuable insights. Yeah, to the variety and complexity of the forms, yeah. But it wasn't really until the 20th century that the study of snowflakes really took off. Yeah, it really was until the 20th century. And a lot of that is thanks to Yukichiro Nakaya, right? Yes. The snowflake man. Yeah, the snowflake man. He was amazing. He was a Japanese physicist and he dedicated his whole life to understanding snowflakes. So he went beyond just observation. He went way beyond observation. He actually created artificial snowflakes in his lab. That's incredible. Yeah, he controlled the temperature and the humidity just to unlock those secrets of how they form. I read that he even like created a whole classification system. He did. And his book is like a foundational text. It is. Snow Crystals, Natural and Artificial. I saw a copy for sale online for almost $4,500. Yeah. Well, that's a testament to the impact of his work. But his work goes way beyond just a hefty price tag. He really advanced our understanding of how snowflakes form. And his research still influences scientists today. Wow. And there's even a museum in Japan dedicated to him. There is. Wow, a whole museum for snowflakes. Yeah. That's amazing. I mean, it speaks volumes about the fascination these things hold for scientists and the public. For everyone. Yeah, and today researchers, people like Kenneth Librecked, are continuing to build upon Nakaya's legacy. Yeah. Using cutting-edge technology to capture even greater detail. Wait, Kenneth Librecked, didn't he work on that movie Frozen? He did. He was like their snowflake consultant. He was. I can't believe that's a real job. I know, right? It's amazing. But his expertise isn't just limited to the science. Oh. He actually helped Disney design the snowflakes for the movie. Wow. Bringing the beauty and the magic of snowflakes to the big screen. That's so cool. It's a pretty cool job, right? It's amazing. And you were saying if people want to see more of his work? Yeah, if you want to see like the level of detail he can capture, you can check out his website. It's called Snow Crystals. Okay. And the photography there is just breathtaking. So it sounds like snowflakes aren't just science. No, they're not. They're art. They're magic. It's kind of magic. Yeah. It's like their own art form. They are. And they've inspired artists and poets for centuries. Absolutely for centuries. Yeah. They're just a reminder that even in like the depths of winter, there's still this delicate beauty to be found. Yeah. So we've talked about how snowflakes form and we've talked about the history of their study. Right. But what about math? Oh, yeah. I mean, snowflakes are so symmetrical. They are. They're all these patterns. There are. So there must be some connection there. You're picking up on something. Yeah, they hold a special place in mathematics. Particularly geometry and the concept of infinity. Oh, okay. I'm very intrigued. So tell me more about the connection between snowflakes and math. Okay, well, there's this Swedish mathematician named Helge von Koch. Okay. And he designed this fascinating shape. It's called the Koch snowflake. Koch snowflake. Yeah. What is that? So imagine you start with just a simple equilateral triangle, right? Okay, a triangle. Yeah. And you divide each side into three equal segments. Okay. And then you remove that middle segment on each side and you replace it with two more line segments that form a smaller equilateral triangle. So it's like pointing outward. It's like a star, kind of. Yeah, kind of like a star. And then you repeat that process over and over again on each new edge. So you're adding all these little triangles. You just keep adding smaller and smaller triangles. It seems like it would just grow forever. In a way, it does. Yeah, so each time you do that, the perimeter of the snowflake, it gets longer and longer because you're adding more sides. Yeah. But here's the paradox. Okay. Even though the perimeter keeps growing infinitely, the area of the snowflake stays finite. It would. It never goes beyond a certain limit. Wow, how is that even possible? I know, it's crazy. That's amazing. Right. Infinite perimeter. Infinite perimeter. But a finite area. Finite area. So how does that? It's wild. It's a really good example of how math can be used to represent these impossible concepts. And it kind of ties back to the snowflake's structure. Okay. Because if you look at a snowflake under a microscope, you see that branching pattern. Right. Repeating itself at smaller and smaller scales. Oh, I see. Kind of like those iterations of the Koch snowflake. So even though every snowflake is unique, there's still this mathematical order to it. Yeah, like an underlying mathematical order. That's so cool. It is, and that order isn't just in their shape. Okay. Researchers have figured out that even the way they move as they fall follows these predictable patterns. I always thought they just kind of floated down randomly. It looks random, like to us, right, with the naked eye. Yeah. But scientists started modeling the movement using something called a Lagrangian particle model. What? A Lagrangian particle model. Oh, man, I don't even know what that means. It's a little technical. Yeah. But basically they're tracking individual snowflakes as they fall. So like zooming in on one snowflake. Exactly, and watching its journey. Wow. And they study how it interacts with the air, how that affects its movement. So they can track like its whole path. Yeah, the whole path. That's amazing. And what's crazy is they've found that like despite their unique shapes, snowflakes actually accelerate according to a pattern. Wow. There's this mathematical relationship. So it's not random. It's not random. It's not random, so they speed up in a predictable way as they fall. So every snowflake, like even though they're all unique, they still kind of follow this universal law. That's so cool. It's pretty cool. It's just that there's more to snowflakes than we might think. Yeah. Like embody randomness and order, complexity and simplicity. Yeah, it's like a tiny puzzle. It's like this perfect balance, yeah. They're like little puzzles that just keep revealing these secrets. So you mentioned
