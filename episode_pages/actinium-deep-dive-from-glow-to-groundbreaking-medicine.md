## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. We're diving into the world of actinium today. Oh yeah. You with me? Absolutely. I am fascinated by this element. I think it's going to be a really fun journey. Yeah. For our listeners, actinium, you may or may not have heard of it. Oh. But it's one of those things where it has a really fascinating history. Absolutely. Some really, really cool properties. Yeah. And it has some potential for some really cool breakthroughs in different fields. For sure. It's one of those elements that often flies under the radar, but there's some really interesting things about it. So what is it? So actinium. Like if I were to hold it in my hand. Okay, well first of all, don't hold it in your hand, okay? It's radioactive. Okay. It's a soft, silvery white metal. Okay. But here's the thing. It glows in the dark. Yeah. With a pale blue light. No way. Yeah. And this is because the particles it's emitting are actually ionizing the air around it, and that causes this luminescence. Whoa. Okay, so it's like its own little light bulb. Kind of, yeah. That's so cool. Okay, so glowing metal, check. Yeah. Now tell me about the discovery. You said two scientists. Yeah, so we start in 1899 with Andre-Louis de Biern, who was a French chemist. Okay. And he was working with pitch blend, which... That was familiar. Yeah, it's the same material that Marie and Pierre Curie... Right, for radium. Used to isolate radium, exactly. Wow. And de Biern believed he found a new element in those leftovers, and he called it actinium. So he's like digging through the trash, basically. Kind of, yeah. He's looking at what else is there, and bam. Wow, that's amazing. So two scientists, you said. Yes. A few years later in 1902, a German chemist named Friedrich Oscar Giesl independently discovered actinium, and he was actually able to isolate it in a pure form, which is amazing for the time. Oh, wow. And being very impressed by the radioactivity, he named it emanium, which means to give off rays. Okay, so we have these two different names from two scientists. Right. Who gets the credit? The credit ultimately went to de Biern because he was the first. That's it. But Giesl's work was so important to really solidify that it existed as an element. Right, I mean, isolating it is huge. Exactly. And it was because of Giesl that we know the atomic number is 89. Okay, so de Biern gets the naming rights, actinium, from the Greek aktis, meaning beam or ray, which makes sense. Absolutely. Very radioactive. It is. Okay, so besides the glowing, what else makes actinium unique? Well, actinium actually behaves a lot like another element on the periodic table, lanthanum. Okay. And this makes separating actinium from ores really difficult because they tend to cling to each other. So it's hard to extract it. Yeah, it's a challenge. I mean, it's already super rare, right? Yes, incredibly rare. So you'd think there wouldn't be a ton of uses. Yeah, so the scarcity and the radioactivity does limit industrial applications, but it has huge potential, particularly in medicine. Really? Oh, yeah. This is where it shines. I'm intrigued, but before we get there. Yeah. Isotopes, right? We have to talk about isotopes. Okay, so remind me again what an isotope is. So isotopes are basically atoms of the same element but with a different number of neutrons. So you can think about them like siblings with different personalities, but they're all in the same family. Okay, I like that. And when it comes to naturally occurring actinium, there are two main isotopes. Actinium-227 and actinium-228. What's the difference? So actinium-227 is a member of the uranium-actinium decay series with a half-life of about 21.7 years. And it primarily decays through something called beta emission, but it can also sometimes release alpha particles. Actinium-228, on the other hand, is part of the thorium decay series, and it has a much shorter half-life, only about six hours. And this one undergoes beta decay. Okay, so one is a little more lively than the other? You could say that. I'm going to guess both of them are pretty hard to find. Yeah, extremely rare. Okay. We're talking trace amounts in uranium and thorium ores. So to give you a sense of the scale, for actinium-227, you would need a ton of natural uranium ore to extract a measly 0.2 milligrams of actinium-227. Okay. And if you're looking for actinium-228, you'd need a ton of thorium to get five nanograms. Oh my gosh. It's like finding a needle in a haystack. It really is. So if it's that rare, how can it have any significant application? Well, that's a great question, and the answer lies in the unique properties of specific actinium isotopes. Okay, this is getting good. Yeah. I can't wait to find out more. We'll dive into that in part two. All right, I'm ready when you are. So before we dive into applications, I think it's important to emphasize that actinium, especially actinium-227, demands a lot of respect. In what sense? Well, its radioactivity means that when you're handling it, specialized laboratories and safety precautions are a must. So this isn't something you just whip out in your basement? No, no, no. We're talking like airtight glove boxes, hot cells with thick shielding to block that intense radiation. Yeah, serious stuff. Makes sense, though. Yeah, but let's shift gears back to the applications of actinium, particularly in medicine for cancer treatment. Right, right. Using it almost like little tiny missiles to deliver radiation directly to cancer cells. Exactly. That's incredible. Yeah, so it's called targeted alpha therapy. Okay. But how do they actually attach? Right, yeah. How do you get it there? That's a great question. So it's all about chemistry. Okay. So actinium, its oxidation state is plus three, which means it readily loses three electrons. Okay. So it really wants to form bonds. Okay. And that's where these chelating agents come in. You mentioned those before, yeah. These molecular claws grabbing hold of the actinium and holding it tight. Okay, so we've got our actinium all strapped in. Right. But how do they, I mean, it's got to get to the right place. Exactly, and that's where antibodies come into play. Okay. You know, these are the remarkable proteins that are actually part of our immune system. Right. And they have this incredible ability to recognize and bind to very specific targets. Oh, wow. Like a lock and key. So each antibody goes to a certain spot. Yes. So in this case, the keyhole would be a unique marker. Right. That's found on the surface of the cancer cells. So it knows where to go. Exactly. So by attaching that actinium-carrying chelating agent to an antibody, you're essentially creating these targeted missiles. Wow, it's like a little GPS system. It is, a GPS system programmed with the cancer's address. That's incredible. And the beauty of this approach is that it allows for incredibly precise delivery. Right. Minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. That's the key. Yeah, so what kind of results are we seeing? Yeah, are we actually seeing results? So it's still early days in terms of widespread clinical use. Okay. But the initial results are very encouraging. That's amazing. Yeah, studies have shown effectiveness against a range of cancers. Wow. From leukemia and lymphoma to breast, ovarian, and even prostate cancer. Oh, wow. So a wide variety. Yeah, but I imagine there are still challenges to overcome. Right. Yeah, it can't be that easy. No, it's not. One of the biggest challenges is actually preventing the actinium from accumulating in healthy tissues. Right, because it's still radioactive. Exactly. So particularly the bones and liver are sensitive. Okay. And so even though the therapy is targeted, there's always a risk of some of the actinium ending up where we don't want it. So how are they working on that? Well, researchers are always experimenting with different chelating agents. Right. Trying to find the ones that will minimize that unwanted accumulation. Okay. And they're also working on ways to improve the body's own natural clearance of actinium. Oh, so the body can flush it out itself. Exactly. Okay, so it's like a constant battle to sort of refine it. It's a constant process of refinement and optimization. Wow, it's incredible, though, how they're taking this element and really making it useful for something so important. And remember we talked about its role in oceanography? Oh, yeah, yeah. As a tracer to study ocean mixing. Right, using it to figure out how the ocean is moving around. Exactly, and this is really important for a lot of reasons. Okay. It impacts things like climate patterns, weather forecasting. Wow. Even the distribution of nutrients and marine life. It's all connected. It is, and actinium-227 and its decay product, thorium-231, give us this unique window into these processes. So you mentioned that actinium kind of moves up, and then the decay product sinks to the ocean floor. So how do they actually track that? Well, it involves collecting water samples at different depths. Okay. Sometimes they use specialized instruments that are lowered from research vessels, and then they bring those samples back to the
