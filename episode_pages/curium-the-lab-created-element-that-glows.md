## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone, for another deep dive. This time we're looking into curium. Curium. And I know what you're thinking. Oh, yeah. Named after Marie and Pierre Curie, right? Of course it is. Yeah, but did you know it glows in the dark? Oh, wow. It's true. That's pretty neat. It is. We're going to unpack how that's even possible by digging into some excerpts from Curium's Wikipedia page. What? And I have an expert here. Yeah, this is really fascinating because unlike most elements, you don't just find curium out in the world. Makes sense of it all. Every single atom of it was created by us in a lab. Yeah, we made this element, so where do we even begin with a story like that? Well, the story starts back in the 1940s at the University of California in Berkeley. Okay. Okay, so picture this. World War II is raging. The Manhattan Project is in full swing. Oh, wow. And there's this intense pressure to make scientific breakthroughs. Huge pressure. And that's where our main characters come in. Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, and Albrecht Urso. These are the guys. Yeah. Okay. And they were working on creating new elements, and in 1944, they managed to create curium-242 by bombarding plutonium-239 with alpha particles in a cyclotron. Yeah, I can't even imagine what that must have been like. And you know, they faced a big challenge in actually separating curium from another element that they created around the same time, americium. Oh. It was so difficult that they nicknamed these elements pandemonium and delirium. Huh-huh. Scientists with a sense of humor. I know. But I guess when you're dealing with brand new elements, a little chaos is expected. Absolutely. But they eventually identified curium-242 through its unique alpha decay signature. Okay. But here's the really interesting part. Okay. Before the official announcement, Seaborg actually leaked the discovery on a children's radio show called Quiz Kids. Wait, seriously? Yeah. He's just casually dropped this groundbreaking scientific discovery on a kid's show. That's amazing. I know, right? So, okay, they discover this new element. Yeah. What does it even look like? So it's a hard, dense, silvery-white metal. Okay. But it's far from ordinary. Okay. Curium has some unusual properties, especially when you compare it to other actinides. Okay. For example, its melting point is 1,344 degrees Celsius. Wow, that's hot. It's incredibly hot. Most metals would be a puddle at that temperature. Exactly. It's quite surprising. Yeah. And then there are its magnetic properties. Okay. As curium cools, it transitions from a paramagnetic state to an antifero-magnetic state. And what's even more interesting is that it shares this characteristic with its lanthanide counterpart, gadolinium. So these two elements from different parts of the periodic table, they behave similarly. Yes. That seems like an important clue about their underlying structure. You're right. The periodic table isn't just this random arrangement. There are these hidden connections and patterns that reveal a deeper order. Totally. Yeah. And these patterns extend to curium's chemical behavior as well. What do you mean? Well, curium tends to exist in a plus-three oxidation state. Okay. Just like many lanthanides. Okay. This gives curium ions a pale green color when dissolved in solution. Okay. It can also exhibit a plus-four state, but it's less common and usually found in solid forms. Like curium dioxide, which I think is pale yellow in solution. Yes, pale yellow. So pale green, pale yellow, not the most vibrant colors in the world. But wait, there's also a plus-six state, right? The curl ion? Yes, but that one is incredibly elusive. It's only been reported once. Really? Wow. Okay, so we've got this element that glows in the dark, has high melting points, and some interesting magnetic properties. Yeah. Now let's dive into what really sets curium apart, its radioactivity. That's a key aspect of curium. All known isotopes of curium are radioactive. Oh, wow. But what makes this really interesting for us is that some of these isotopes have incredibly long half-lives, which means they decay very slowly. Like curium-247, which has a half-life of 15.6 million years. Exactly. And curium-248 with a half-life of 348,000 years. That's longer than humans have been around. I know, it's incredible. Yeah, why are these long half-lives so important? Well, they make these isotopes ideal for research. Okay. They're relatively stable, allowing scientists to study their properties in depth. Right. However, even with these longer-lived isotopes, obtaining specific ones can be incredibly challenging. Because they exist within these intricate decay chains. Yeah, like trying to pluck a single thread from a giant tangled mess. Right, yeah. A very apt analogy. Yeah. And then there's curium-250, which primarily decays through spontaneous fission. Spontaneous fission, that sounds intense. It is. Instead of just emitting particles, the atom actually splits apart. Wow. And this brings us back to that glowing metal fact we mentioned earlier. Right. That's what I'm most curious about. Yeah. It's like something out of a sci-fi movie. Well, it's due to curium's intense radioactivity. And this causes it to emit a purple glow in the dark. It's almost poetic considering it's named after Marie Curie, who pioneered work with radium, another luminescent radioactive element. That's incredible. Yeah. But aside from this cool visual effect, how do we actually use curium? Well, curium-244 was initially considered for use in radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Okay. But its high cost and neutron emission made it impractical. Too bad. But I read that curium has some other surprising uses, especially in space exploration. That's right. Really? Curium has become essential for understanding the composition of other planets and celestial bodies. It's used as an alpha particle source in those amazing APXS instruments. APXS. Yeah, alpha particle X-ray spectrometers, which are like portable curium-powered labs. Wait, so these instruments are using curium's radiation to analyze stuff on other planets? Exactly. It's incredible that we can use something we made here on Earth to study the cosmos. It really highlights the ingenuity of scientists and their ability to harness even the most seemingly dangerous forces for good. Absolutely. Okay, so how do these APXS instruments actually work? So the curium inside the instrument emits alpha particles. Think of them as tiny, high-energy projectiles. Okay. And these particles bombard the target material, say a rock on Mars. Okay. And by analyzing how the alpha particles scatter or what kind of X-rays they excite in the process, we can figure out the elemental composition of that rock. It's like a high-tech game of atomic billiards. That is so cool. It makes you wonder what other secrets of the universe are hidden within the elements we're still discovering. There's always more to uncover. For sure. Speaking of secrets, we've talked about curium's high melting point, but have you ever wondered about its density? Hmm, not really. Okay. But now that you mention it, I'm curious. Okay, so curium's density is 13.52 grams per cubic centimeter. Okay. That's denser than most metals. Okay. But interestingly, lighter than its neighbors on the periodic table, neptunium and plutonium. Wait, so it's denser than most metals, but lighter than its neighbors? That seems like a contradiction. It's a bit of an anomaly. Yeah. And scientists are still exploring why that is. It could be related to the way curium's atoms are arranged in its crystal structure. And speaking of structure, did you know curium can actually exist in two different crystalline forms? Two different forms? What are they like? So there's alpha curium, which is the most stable form at room temperature. Okay. It has a hexagonal symmetry. But under high pressure, it can transition to beta curium, which has a face-centered cubic structure. So if we squeeze curium hard enough, it actually changes its structure. That's pretty wild. This is... Does this change in structure affect any of its other properties? It can. For example, the transition from alpha curium to beta curium affects its magnetic behavior. Oh, right. We were talking about that earlier. Yeah. The whole paramagnetic to antifero-magnetic shift that it shares with gadolinium. And these changes in magnetic properties can also influence a material's electrical conductivity. So squeezing curium could potentially change how well it conducts electricity. It's amazing how something as simple as pressure can have such profound effects. It's a reminder that even the most basic physical forces can dramatically alter the properties of matter. Right. And these changes can be difficult to predict and fully understand. Absolutely. You know, we talked about curium's radioactivity making it difficult to handle. Right. But are there any other challenges in studying this element? There are quite a few. Like what? For instance, accurately measuring curium's electrical resistivity is notoriously difficult. Why is that? What makes it so tricky? It all boils down to alpha decay. Okay. As curium undergoes alpha decay, those emitted particles cause damage to its own crystal lattice. And this damage over time increases its electrical resistivity. So it's like its own radioactivity is constantly changing its electrical properties. Exactly. It's like trying to hit a moving target. Right. It makes you wonder what other secrets are hidden within this element. What are scientists still trying
