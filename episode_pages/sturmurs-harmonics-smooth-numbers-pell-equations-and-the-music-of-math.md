## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of prime numbers. Through the work of Carl Sturmur, a Norwegian mathematician and astrophysicist. Sturmur's work is particularly intriguing, I think, because it kind of bridges these seemingly disparate fields like number theory and music. Okay, so let's break this down for our listener. Sure. What exactly are smooth numbers? Okay. And how do they relate to Sturmur's theorem? So smooth numbers, they're integers whose prime factors belong to a specific set. Okay. So for example, if we consider the set of primes like 2, 3, and 5, then 30 is a smooth number because it's divisible by 2, 3, and 5. Okay. Right, so Sturmur's theorem states that for any given set of prime factors, there are only like a finite number of pairs of consecutive smooth numbers. So there's a limit to how many of these smooth pairs we can find depending on the initial set of primes. Exactly. Sturmur also developed a method for actually finding these pairs, right? That's right. His method involves solving a series of Pell equations, which have the general form x squared minus dy squared equals 1, where d is related to the specific set of primes we're working with. This is where it gets interesting. Right. How do these Pell equations, which seem pretty abstract, lead us to those smooth number pairs? So each Pell equation with its unique d value corresponds to a specific combination of prime factors. Right. By solving these equations, we can pinpoint the consecutive smooth number pairs where we're looking for. I understand this has a surprising connection to music theory. Yes. Particularly just intonation. Yeah. Could you elaborate on that for our listener? So in just intonation, musical intervals are represented by ratios of whole numbers. Okay. Smooth numbers play like a crucial role in defining these ratios. For instance, in Pythagorean tuning, which relies on the prime factors 2 and 3, the only possible super particular ratios come from smooth number pairs like 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, and 8, 9. Okay. These ratios give us the octave, the perfect fifth, perfect fourth, and the whole step, which are like fundamental intervals in Western music. So the distribution of primes essentially dictates kind of the possible harmonies within this tuning system. It's fascinating how a mathematical concept like smooth numbers can have such a direct impact on music. But Sturmur's work goes beyond this, right? Absolutely. Yeah. His work on smooth numbers has like broader implications for understanding the structure of certain number fields. Okay. These are, you know, algebraic structures that generalize the concept of rational numbers. Okay. Sturmur's theorem provides insights into like the complexity of these number fields. So something that starts as a seemingly simple question about consecutive smooth numbers... Ends up having these far-reaching connections to abstract algebraic structures. Precisely. Wow. And this is just one example of how Sturmur's work continues to influence like research in number theory. There's even a connection to like a recent breakthrough involving a tool called the Gowers norm, which was traditionally used to analyze randomness in functions. That sounds like a surprising connection. Yeah. How did the Gowers norm, which deals with randomness, end up being applied to the study of prime numbers? It's a fascinating development. Mathematicians Ben Green and Freddie Manners, building on work by Green and Terrence Tao, used the Gowers norm to understand the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions. This work, like indirectly related to Sturmur's ideas, has opened up new avenues for research in number theory, demonstrating the power of like applying tools from different areas of mathematics. So Sturmur's legacy extends beyond his specific theorem to influencing a whole new way of approaching problems in number theory. That's right. His work has provided, you know, valuable insights into the structure of numbers and the surprising connections between seemingly unrelated fields of mathematics. It's fantastic. Yeah. It's amazing how these abstract mathematical concepts like smooth numbers can have such a like tangible impact on something like music. And to think it all stems from the work of like one individual. You know, Sturmur's influence on number theory is kind of multifaceted. You know, while his theorem on smooth numbers is like a significant contribution, it's just one facet of his impact. You know, his exploration of Pell equations, which he used to find those smooth pairs, has also had a lasting impact. Could you elaborate on that for our listener? Why are Pell equations so significant in this context? So Pell equations are a type of Diophantine equation, which means we're looking for integer solutions. They have the form x squared minus d, y squared equals 1. What's interesting is that Sturmur's method for solving these equations, which involves continued fractions, can be extended to handle other types of Diophantine equations, not just those related to smooth numbers. So the techniques he developed for finding those smooth pairs have broader applications in solving a wider range of mathematical problems. Exactly. For example, Sturmur's work was instrumental in like partially proving Catalan's conjecture, which is a famous problem in number theory that deals with consecutive perfect powers. It states that the only consecutive perfect powers are 8 and 9. So the tools he developed for one specific problem ended up having implications for a completely different problem about the relationship between powers. Right. That's remarkable. Yeah, it's a testament to the interconnectedness of different areas of number theory. Often, you know, solutions in one area can illuminate and provide tools for tackling problems in seemingly unrelated areas. And Sturmur's work beautifully exemplifies this interconnectedness. We've been discussing the theoretical aspects of Sturmur's work. Yes. But I'm curious about the computational side. Sure. How do we actually find those smooth number pairs using his method? So while the theory behind Sturmur's method is elegant, the actual computation can be quite intensive. It involves solving multiple Pell equations, and that requires sophisticated algorithms and computational tools. So we can't just do this by hand? Not for anything beyond, like, the simplest cases. Right. But thankfully, we have algorithms and software packages that can handle these calculations efficiently. Okay. These tools are based on the principles of continued fractions, which we touched on earlier. I recall you mentioning continued fractions as a way to, like, approximate irrational numbers. How do they relate to solving Pell equations? So continued fractions are a way of representing numbers as a sequence of integers. What's fascinating is that the continued fraction representation of the square root of D, where D is that coefficient in our Pell equation, reveals the solutions to the equation. Oh, wow. So by analyzing this continued fraction, we can extract the solutions we need. So it's not just about brute force computation. There's a clever mathematical trick involved in finding those solutions. Exactly. That's quite elegant. It is. Yeah. And Sturmur's method, by connecting Pell equations to the search for smooth pairs, leverages this elegance to solve seemingly complex problems in a structured and systematic way. Sturmur's theorem itself mentions that the number of smooth pairs is finite. Yeah. But it also provides a way to estimate an upper bound on how many pairs there can be, right? That's right. Yeah. These bounds are crucial for practical computations. Okay. They act as a stopping criterion for our algorithms. Okay. If we found a number of pairs equal to the upper bound, we know we've exhausted all possibilities and can stop searching. Right. This saves significant computational time and resources. So these theoretical bounds have a direct impact on the efficiency of our algorithm. Exactly. And that's a recurring theme in mathematics. Right. Theoretical insights often guide and optimize practical computations. Mm-hmm. Sturmur's work beautifully exemplifies this interplay between theory and application. It's clear that Sturmur's legacy in number theory extends far beyond his specific theorem on smooth numbers. Yes. His work has touched various areas of the field, from Diophantine equations to computational algorithms. Yeah. Is there anything else you'd like to highlight for our listener about the broader impact of his work? So Sturmur's research has also found applications in modern cryptography and coding theory. Wow. While this might seem surprising at first, the underlying principles of his work, particularly the use of smooth numbers and Pell equations, have proven valuable in these fields. Could you elaborate on that? How do these seemingly abstract concepts find application in areas like cryptography and coding theory? So certain cryptographic systems rely on the difficulty of solving specific mathematical problems for their security. And you won't believe this, but some of these systems actually utilize smooth numbers and Pell equations as part of their security foundation. So the concepts that Sturmur explored over a century ago are now being used to safeguard our online transactions and protect sensitive data. It's remarkable, isn't it? Yeah. The McLeese crypto system, for example, relies on a special type of code based on algebraic geometry. Okay. And the security of this system partly depends on the difficulty of factoring certain polynomials. Okay. The structure of certain smooth numbers and solutions to specific Pell equations can be used to construct these codes, making them robust and secure. So in a way, Sturmur's work contributes to the security of our digital world. It's a fascinating and indirect connection. This exemplifies how seemingly esoteric mathematical concepts can have unexpected and profound applications in practical fields. And it's not just cryptography. Right. Smooth numbers and Pell equations also appear in coding theory. Yes. Which focuses on ensuring accurate data transmission. That's right. They're used in designing error-correcting codes, which help detect and correct errors during data transmission, just like cryptography. Right. Some of these codes leverage the difficulty of solving certain mathematical problems. Right. And the structure of smooth numbers and solutions to Pell equations can be used to construct these error-resistant codes. So even
