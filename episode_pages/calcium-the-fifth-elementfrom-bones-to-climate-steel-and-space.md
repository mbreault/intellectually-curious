## Transcript

Welcome back, everybody, to another deep dive with us. Today we're going to be looking at something kind of different. It's something we all know and love, or at least we should, calcium. Calcium. Calcium. It's in our bones, it's in our teeth, it's in our milk, but what else is there to calcium, you know? Yeah. What's the big deal? And to help us figure that out today, we've got some really interesting sources. We're going to be diving into some information from the NIH, which is always a good time. Right, a good source. Yeah, always a really, really credible source. They know what they're talking about over at the NIH. Absolutely. We're also going to be taking a deep dive into the periodic table. We've got a great chemistry source today that I think is going to blow your minds. Oh, I love a good periodic table deep dive. Right, me too. Who doesn't love a good periodic table deep dive? And to round things out, we've got some health news to bring to the table today as well, so we're covering all our bases. Excellent. So to kick things off, I wanted to ask you something. Have you ever stopped to think about what makes your teeth so strong, or like where seashells come from? Oh, all the time. Yeah. Really? Okay, so you're way ahead of me. Well, it's true. It's all connected to this incredible element we're talking about, calcium. Oh, okay, all right. I'm starting to see where you're going with this. I should have known better. You know I can't stump you. So tell me more about this, I guess. Calcium's bigger role. Like how much of it is actually out there in the world? Well, get this. Calcium is the fifth most abundant element on Earth. Whoa, fifth. Fifth. And that's not all. It holds the same ranking in the lunar highlands, too. So whether you're here on Earth or gazing at the moon, calcium is a major player. Okay, that's a lot of calcium. But I have to ask, are we like tripping over giant chunks of pure calcium everywhere we go? Because I don't think I've ever seen that. That's a great point. You're rarely going to find pure calcium just lying around. It's much more common to find it bound to other elements, forming compounds. You know those stunning white cliffs of Dover? Yeah, beautiful. Mostly calcium carbonate, which is also known as limestone. Limestone. Okay, that makes sense. So how do we get from limestone to, say, the calcium in our milk or in our bones? It's a process. Most commercial calcium is actually extracted by reducing lime, which is another calcium compound, with aluminum. It's kind of like using a specific key to unlock calcium from this compound form. Interesting. So we've talked about calcium being in rocks, even on the moon, but I think most people probably associate it with strong bones, right? Like, that's got to be the first thing that comes to mind. Absolutely, and it's true. About 99% of the calcium in our bodies is hanging out in our bones and teeth. It's literally the structural support that lets us walk, jump, give a big smile. Yeah, without it we'd be like blobs. Exactly. But our sources are hinting that calcium's talents, they kind of go beyond just, you know, keeping our skeletons from falling apart. Way beyond. It's looking like it's pretty essential for making our muscles move, including, you know, the big kahuna, our heart. Oh, absolutely. It's a crucial part of that process. You see, without calcium, our muscles wouldn't be able to contract. Yeah. Think about calcium ions as these tiny messengers carrying these electrical signals that basically tell your muscles when to spring into action. So every time you move, you've got calcium to thank. So every time I move, it's like a tiny little calcium party going on in my muscles. Pretty much. That's amazing. I had no idea it was involved in so many different processes. Oh, there's even more. It's not just movement. Calcium plays a vital role in blood clotting as well. Think of it as like the first responder to an injury, helping to stop bleeding quickly. Wow. So calcium is like this multitasking marvel. It's keeping our bodies running smoothly in more ways than I even realized. Precisely. And you know what's even more fascinating? It's not just limited to us. It's got talents that extend way beyond the human body. It's almost like, I don't know, it has this hand in shaping our world from the inside out. Okay, now you've really got me intrigued because I'm not seeing the connection to like the whole world yet. What else does calcium get up to outside of our bodies? Well, for starters, let's talk about steel. Steel. Okay. Our chemistry source, it dives into how calcium actually plays this really crucial role in the steel making process. Really? Huh. I never would guess that. Yeah, it's pretty cool. So you see, to make steel, you have to remove impurities from molten iron. And that's where our friend calcium comes in. So how's it do that? Does it like wave a magic calcium wand and poof, impurities done? Well, not exactly. It's more like chemistry in action. Basically, the calcium has this really unique ability to bond with things like oxygen and sulfur, which happen to be common impurities found in iron. So it acts kind of like a, I don't know, a magnetic sponge, grabbing onto those unwanted elements, making them easier to remove. So like the next time I see a skyscraper or a bridge, I should be picturing these tiny little calcium magnets just like doing their thing, keeping everything together. That's pretty cool. That's really cool. But you know, we saw something else in our sources about spacecraft too. I'm really curious about this. Is calcium somehow involved in space exploration as well? It could be. Scientists are actually exploring its potential use in spacecraft right now. And it all comes down to a property called conductivity by mass. Basically what that means is calcium is a really good conductor of electricity for how light it is. And that makes it, you know, kind of ideal for building things like lightweight yet powerful components for spacecraft. So are we talking like spacecraft powered by calcium in the future? That sounds like something straight out of a science fiction novel. Right. The future is closer than we think. Wow. But for now, let's maybe like shift gears back to Earth for a moment. Because I was really fascinated by this whole idea of how calcium is literally woven into the fabric of our planet. Ah, yes. You're talking about the calcium cycle. The calcium cycle. It's this continuous process where calcium is constantly moving through different parts of the environment. It's playing a key role in everything from the way tectonic plates move to how our climate is regulated. It's like calcium is the silent guardian working behind the scenes to keep everything in balance. Exactly. Our sources were describing how, you know, the movement of those tectonic plates, it actually exposes these calcium-rich rocks to weathering. And then that releases calcium ions into the water, which, you know, eventually flows into the ocean. But what I don't understand is how does that end up impacting our climate? It seems like such a jump. It's all about this amazing chemical balancing act, really. So once those calcium ions, they reach the ocean, they react with dissolved carbon dioxide, which, as you know, is a major greenhouse gas. Right. Okay. And then get this. This reaction forms calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate, which is... It eventually settles to the ocean floor. Wait, hold on. So what you're saying is calcium is actually helping to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. You got it. So it's like this silent climate hero working behind the scenes to regulate our planet. Precisely. And this just goes to show how interconnected these systems are, even though they seem totally separate at first glance. You know, what affects one affects the other, and it all comes back to calcium. Wow. I never would have guessed that calcium had such a global impact. That's amazing. It is. And what's even more fascinating is that this cycle, it has direct implications for our own health as well. Okay. Back to our bodies. Tell me more. I need to know. So scientists have discovered that they can actually analyze the different types of calcium, called isotopes, that are in our bones to study our bone health. Isotopes. Okay. Yeah, and these calcium isotopes, they're like fingerprints. They can actually reveal all these clues about how our bones are formed and even help doctors detect diseases like osteoporosis early on. Wow. Calcium is like the gift that keeps on giving. Isn't it? So what you're telling me is the calcium in my bones, it might have like once been part of a mountain range or helped regulate the climate millions of years ago. It's true. It's like this incredible feedback loop, you know? Calcium's journey through our bodies and the environment, it's influencing everything from our bone density to the planet's climate. It's kind of mind-boggling when you really think about it. It really is. So we've covered a lot of ground here today about how important calcium is, but there's like one more thing we should probably touch on before we wrap things up, right? Making sure we're getting enough of it. Absolutely. Can't forget about... Because you know what they say? You are what you eat. That's the truth. So what are the best ways to make sure we're getting enough of this wonder element? Well, as always, a balanced diet is key. Makes sense. Our sources all highlight a variety of calcium-rich foods, things like dairy products, leafy green vegetables. Okay, so like milk, cheese, yogurt, spinach, kale. Got it. But, you know, I do remember reading something about leafy greens and calcium absorption
