## Description

A deep dive into the unseen price of waiting. We unpack cost of delay analysisâ€”from practical metrics like CD3 and loss-month cost to the four COD curves (standard, urgent, fixed-date, intangible)â€”and show how delaying decisions or launches costs more than the budget. Drawing on private-sector lessons (Maersk, prioritization) and public-sector applications (Air Force, Kessel Run, TBMCS, Kratos), we synthesize academic papers, industry articles, and an Air Force AFIT thesis to reveal how to measure, model, and act on delay in real-world software and mission-critical programs.

## Transcript

Have you ever been stuck trying to make a decision? You know, maybe fixing something that's broken or launching a new feature. You think about the effort, the cost to do it, right? But how often do you really consider the cost of not doing it? That sort of invisible cost of just waiting? Yeah, that waiting period, the delay, it's almost never free, is it? There are always consequences and often you can actually measure them. Absolutely. And that hidden cost, that's exactly what we're plunging into today. We're talking about understanding and quantifying the value you lose by delaying action. It's a concept called cost of delay analysis. Right. And for this deep dive, we've looked at a whole stack of sources a listener sent over. It's a really interesting mix, academic papers, industry articles, even a detailed thesis looking at how the U.S. Air Force uses it. Pretty specific stuff. So our mission today, take all that material, pull out the core ideas. We want to unpack what cost of delay really means, how it works, you know, in the real world, and explore why it's particularly challenging but also super valuable in places like the public sector or, say, complex software projects. Basically, pull out the key takeaways for you. Let's get into it. Okay, so let's start with the basics, the fundamental idea. Cost of delay. At its heart, it's about putting a number on the future opportunity costs, the costs you rack up by postponing a decision or delaying a project launch or even just slowing down its completion. Okay, so it's not just the project budget, like the money you spend to build the thing. No, not just that. It's the value you would have gotten if you'd finished sooner that you're now missing out on. That's exactly it. It's the value you could have been getting from the finished product being out there or the decision being made for that period of time. That value is lost because of the delay. Where did this way of thinking come from? Did it start somewhere specific? It definitely has strong roots in the private sector. I mean, that makes sense, right? Focus on the bottom line. One source we looked at mentions companies like Maersk Line, you know, the huge shipping company. Yeah, container ships everywhere. Right. They were apparently pioneers here. They realized that value wasn't just about, say, increasing revenue. It could also mean protecting the revenue you already have or reducing your operating costs or even, you know, actively avoiding costs down the line. That's a really key shift in thinking, isn't it? Value isn't just making more money. It really is. And they actually developed specific methods to handle this, like a metric they called cost of delay divided by duration, CD3 for short. CD3, OK. Yeah, it helped them prioritize. They had tons of work, obviously. This helped them see which tasks gave the most value compared to how long they'd take. Cost of delay divided by duration, CD3. That makes a lot of sense for prioritizing, actually. You want the biggest impact in the shortest time. Exactly. And the sources also mentioned that this cost, this cost of delay, it doesn't always just creep up steadily. The way it changes over time can be quite different depending on the situation. Yes, absolutely. That's where understanding the different COD curves, as one source calls them, comes in handy. It helps you sort of categorize the urgency and the potential impact. The simplest one is the standard curve. That's where the cost of delay just grows linearly over time. Pretty straightforward, easy to calculate. Like a dripping tap, just steadily losing value. Sort of like that, yeah. Then you've got the urgent curve. Now here, the cost is higher right from the get-go. And it shoots up fast. Think about like a competitor launching a game-changing product. Every single day you wait to respond, that opportunity cost is just rocketing upwards. Right, okay. That's like a fire alarm going off. What about things tied to specific dates? That would be the fixed date curve. For these kinds of things, the cost of delay is basically zero. Until you hit a specific deadline you absolutely cannot miss. Could be a change in the law, a big marketing campaign launch, a conference maybe. If you miss that date, the cost doesn't just tick up, it often jumps massively. It could make the whole project worthless or incredibly expensive to fix. So hitting that date is absolutely everything. Pretty much. And then finally, there's the intangible curve. This is for your low-priority stuff. Things with minimal immediate impact. The cost of delay is low, maybe even flat. Putting it off doesn't really hurt the organization much. It can wait. Simple as that. Basically, yeah. Now, there's also a specific calculation people sometimes use within this COD framework, especially in sales or manufacturing. It's called the loss month cost. It tries to quantify the potential cost you face during a peak period, like your busiest sales month. How do they work that out? Well, often it's calculated by taking the expected peak sales volume for that month and multiplying it by the product's profit margin. The idea is to really highlight how much opportunity cost you're facing if you don't have your product ready, or maybe a process isn't optimized during those absolutely critical high-demand times. Makes you think twice about delaying into peak season, right? Yeah, that really puts a spotlight on the seasonal impact. Makes it very visible. Now, one of the sources also had a non-military example from a manufacturer, right? Illustrating similar ideas but maybe using different terms. Yes, that's right. They didn't necessarily call it cost of delay, but they were definitely focused on managing costs related to time and efficiency. They used what the source called cost contrast techniques. Specifically, they focused on standardizing processes and using continuous monitoring, especially across their supply chain and internal operations. And what was the result? What did that do for them? Well, by standardizing things, they got more consistency. Better quality, more predictable output. And that cut down on cost variations you get from rework or defects. And the continuous monitoring things like regular checks, real-time data, let them catch problems, quality issues, bottlenecks much, much earlier. So they were basically preventing the cost of delay that comes from bad quality or holdups by being proactive. Exactly. It cut rework costs, boosted overall efficiency, and helped them spot potential cost overruns before they got out of hand. So yeah, while maybe not using the exact COD calculation framework we've been discussing, it's definitely embodying that core principle. Understand and tackle the costs that come with delays, errors, or things just not running smoothly. Okay, so we see how this COD thinking works in the business world, where profit and efficiency are key drivers. But what happens when you try to apply that to somewhere totally different, like the Department of Defense? I mean, their mission isn't making money. Right, and this is where the sources, especially that Air Force thesis, get really interesting. Because you're absolutely right, trying to directly paste a commercial COD model onto a public sector entity like the DOD, it's really, really tricky. The core motivation is just fundamentally different. You can't measure success in dollars and cents or market share. So you have to completely redefine value. Precisely. In the DOD world, value is tied directly to their unique mission, which is providing military readiness. And that covers everything they need, personnel, equipment, logistics, and increasingly really effective software systems. Yeah, software's readiness these days, isn't it, in a modern military context? It absolutely is. And this is a big deal. The sources point out that the DOD has historically used older, sometimes like decades old, methods for building software, waterfall, that kind of thing. But there's a real push now, backed up by research like this AFIT thesis, to adopt modern agile methods. Agile, meaning faster, more iterative development cycles. Exactly. And you see places like Kessel Run and the Air Force popping up. These are basically software factories using agile. The AFIT research actually digs into creating a COD framework specifically for this kind of environment, public sector, Air Force, using agile. It tries to solve that core problem, adapting a profit-driven idea to a mission-driven world. Okay, let's dig into Kessel Run then. What kind of work are they actually doing where this COD analysis becomes useful? So Kessel Run's job is basically to modernize Air Force software using these agile practices. They build applications like the ones in what they call the Kratos portfolio. And these are designed to replace older legacy systems. A really big example mentioned is replacing the Theater Battle Management Core System, or TBMCS. TBMCS. Yeah. That sounds pretty important. Oh, it is. It's like a core system for air command and control. So replacing something that huge and complex with new agile-built applications like Kratos, that's a massive undertaking. And as the sources show, delaying that full replacement, well, it has a very real cost of delay, even if you're not measuring profit. Can they actually put a number on that? Quantify it? They can, at least partially. The sources give a specific example. They calculated a part of the cost of delay for the time lag in fully switching from TBMCS to Kratos. And they focus on the ongoing cost of just keeping the old TBMCS contract running. Ah, so the cost of not being able to turn off the old system because the new one isn't fully ready yet. Exactly that. The source states the TBMCS contract costs about $16.54 million a year. If you break that down, it's roughly $1.378 million every single month. That monthly bill just keeps coming for every month that Kratos isn't fully operational and ready to take over all of TBMCS's functions. Wow, okay. $1.378 million a month
