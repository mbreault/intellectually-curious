## Transcript

Hey everyone and welcome back for another deep dive. Today we are tackling, well, the king of the planets. Jupiter. You guys sent in some awesome excerpts from its Wikipedia page. And we are going to unpack all the juicy details. How did this giant shape our solar system? Could it be a failed star? What's the deal with that great red spot? So many questions. But luckily our expert is here to help us sift through the facts. And piece together this incredible story of Jupiter. They're amazing at spotting those IHA connections. What's fascinating to you about Jupiter? I think for me Jupiter really represents just how much we're still learning. About our own cosmic backyard. Like we used to think gas giants like Jupiter. Pretty straightforward, you know, big balls of gas. But now we know they're far more dynamic. And complex than we ever imagined. Yeah, okay, so let's start unraveling some of those complexities. The information you provided about Jupiter's formation was fascinating. It wasn't just hanging out in its current orbit from day one, was it? Not at all. The current thinking suggests Jupiter actually formed much farther out. In the solar system? Perhaps even three times farther than Earth is from the sun. Wow. And get this, a mere million years. After the sun's birth. Okay, a million years sounds like a long time to me. But on a cosmic scale, that's got to be like a blink of an eye. Exactly, yeah. But it didn't stay put, right? It went on quite a journey. Through the early solar system. That's right, it did. The leading theory now is something called the Grand Tac Hypothesis. Okay. And this paints a picture of Jupiter actually migrating inward. Towards the sun, interacting with all that swirling gas and dust. That still filled the solar system back then. So like a gravitational dance floor, but Jupiter's leading the way? Yeah, yeah, pretty much. Must have been total chaos. Oh, absolutely. And as Jupiter moved inward, its immense gravity. Acted like a cosmic bulldozer, scattering smaller objects like asteroids. Even influencing the formation of the inner planets. Wait, so Jupiter's journey affected us here on Earth? It might have been crucial to Earth forming at all. One thought is that Jupiter's inward migration. Might have actually prevented a super-Earth. From forming closer to the sun. Okay. Clearing the way for smaller, rocky planets like Earth to emerge. That's mind-blowing that this giant planet's journey billions of years ago. Could be the reason why Earth exists. Yeah. As we know it. And it gets even wilder. Jupiter didn't just keep heading toward the sun. It seems to have reversed course. Migrating back outwards to its current location. So it took a grand tour of the solar system before settling down. What could cause a planet to make such a dramatic U-turn? Yeah, the exact mechanics are still being debated. The Grand Tack Hypothesis suggests that maybe interactions with Saturn's gravity. Maybe even a brief gravitational resonance between the two. Might have played a role in flinging Jupiter back outwards. Fascinating. It's like a cosmic game of tug-of-war on a scale we can barely comprehend. Yeah. But this Grand Tack idea, it's not the only theory out there though, right? That's right. Other models like the Nice Model. Suggest that Jupiter formed much closer to the sun and then migrated outward. Okay. This model connects Jupiter to a period of intense asteroid bombardment. Early in the solar system's history. There's still a lot that we are piecing together about those early stages. It's amazing how much we can glean from, you know, billions of years ago. Speaking of piecing things together, let's talk about what makes Jupiter tick. We know it's a gas giant, but what does that actually mean? It's not just a giant balloon floating in space, right? Not quite. It's true that Jupiter is mostly hydrogen and helium, just like the sun. Okay. But under those immense pressures deep inside. These gases behave in really extraordinary ways. The Wikipedia article mentions something about metallic hydrogen. What is that and how does it change our understanding of Jupiter? So metallic hydrogen is one of the most bizarre forms of matter. Imagine squeezing hydrogen atoms so tightly that their electrons become detached. Allowing them to flow freely, almost like in a metal. It's thought to be responsible for Jupiter's incredibly powerful magnetic field. So even though it's mostly made of gas, it's not something you could just land on. Exactly. There's no solid surface to speak of. If you tried to land on Jupiter, you would just keep sinking deeper and deeper. Into those increasingly dense layers of gas. And just how big are we talking about here? Because I feel like the numbers on its size are truly mind-boggling. Yeah, mind-boggling is right. Jupiter's diameter is about 11 times that of Earth. To put that into perspective, you could fit over 1,300 Earths inside of Jupiter. Wow. It's so massive that its gravitational pull affects objects. Clear across the solar system. Wow, that really puts things into perspective. It's easy to feel small when you're talking about a planet that massive. Yeah, for sure. And its mass is just as impressive. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Jupiter weighs in at 318 times the mass of Earth. Making it the heavyweight champion of our solar system. Okay, I'm getting the picture. Jupiter's big. Really, really big. But it's not just its size that's captivating. It's got that incredible swirling atmosphere. What creates those vibrant colors and that iconic great red spot? Jupiter's atmosphere is like a giant dynamic canvas. Okay. Those colors you see, the oranges, the reds, the browns. They all come from trace elements like phosphorus, sulfur, hydrocarbons. That get churned up from those deeper layers and then interact with sunlight. So it's like this giant chemistry experiment happening right before our eyes. Exactly. But on a planetary scale. Yeah. And what about those distinct bands of color? The zones and belts. They're so defined, it's almost artistic. So Jupiter's incredibly fast rotation is key. Okay. It spins so fast that a day on Jupiter is actually less than 10 Earth hours. Oh, wow. That rapid spin combined with internal heat rising from its core. Generates these powerful jet streams that flow from east to west. And it's these jet streams that essentially carve the atmosphere. Into those light colored zones and those darker belts. So it's not just a pretty picture. It's a glimpse into these powerful forces. That are shaping Jupiter's atmosphere. Which brings us to the million dollar question. The great red spot. It's been a source of fascination for centuries. What do we know about this massive storm? So the great red spot is a high pressure region in Jupiter's atmosphere. An anticyclone, to be precise. Okay. And it's been raging for at least 400 years. Maybe even longer. To call it big is a serious understatement. It's bigger than the entire Earth. Centuries old and bigger than Earth. At least. It makes you realize how insignificant our concept of time is. In the grand scheme of things. Right. But what keeps a storm going for that long? That's a question that has puzzled scientists for a long time. It seems that the great red spot is constantly being fueled by energy. From Jupiter's internal heat and those surrounding jet streams. Imagine these jet streams almost acting like walls. Okay. Containing the storm and just keeping it spinning. So we're talking about this storm that's been swirling for centuries. Maybe even millennia. Held together by these invisible walls of wind. What's the inside scoop? What makes up this massive storm? Well, it's thought to be this, like, cocktail of ammonia. Ammonium hydrosulfide and possibly hydrocarbons. These compounds get churned up from those deeper layers. And they give that great red spot its distinctive reddish hue. Though the exact chemical processes are still being unraveled. It's fascinating how something can be so beautiful and mesmerizing from a distance. But actually a turbulent, chaotic storm up close. And speaking of turbulence. We can't forget about the diamond rain. Oh, yeah. It sounds like something straight out of science fiction. But you're telling me there's actual science behind this. Yeah. It's one of those theories that sound almost too incredible to be true. But the chemistry and physics, you know, do seem to add up. Remember how we talked about Jupiter's atmosphere? Mostly hydrogen and helium. With traces of other elements like methane. Yes. And how that methane is key to this whole diamond rain thing. So deep within Jupiter's atmosphere, where the pressures and temperatures are just off the charts. Okay. Those methane molecules can actually break down. And this process releases carbon atoms. And under those extreme conditions, they can bond together to form, you guessed it, diamonds. So deep inside Jupiter, it's raining diamonds. That's just wild. That's the current thinking. Though it is important to note we haven't actually directly observed. This diamond rain. Okay. And these wouldn't be like the big sparkling diamonds we're used to here on Earth. Right, right. They'd be more like tiny, like diamond dust particles. Still diamond rain. Okay, I need to stop before I get lost in the allure. Of all that sparkle. So we've covered kind of the inside story of Jupiter's atmosphere. But its influence extends far beyond those swirling clouds, right? The Wikipedia article mentioned something about Jupiter having its own rings. I always thought Saturn was the ring planet. Yeah, Saturn's rings are definitely more prominent. Much more eye-catching. But you are right, Jupiter does have a ring system too. They're much fainter. And they're composed mainly of dust rather than ice. So how did Jupiter get its own set of rings? Well, they're thought to be formed by dust that's kicked up. From impacts on Jupiter's smaller inner moons. Okay. The Voyager missions actually provided our first real
