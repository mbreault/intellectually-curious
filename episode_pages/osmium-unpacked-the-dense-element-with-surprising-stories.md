## Transcript

Welcome to another deep dive. Today we're going deep on osmium. You probably know it as like that super dense element. Right. And yeah, we'll definitely touch on that. But trust me, there's so much more to this metal than density. We've got some scientific articles, even a podcast episode, and even some historical tidbits from Wikipedia to guide us. So get ready for some serious aha moments. I'm pretty sure you'll be surprised. Osmium has really impacted science and history. Fascinating element. Okay, so let's unpack this. Osmium, densest naturally occurring element, right? Like twice as dense as lead. But how dense is that really? What does it even feel like? Okay, imagine you're holding a tiny cube of osmium, just an inch on each side. That little cube would weigh over a pound. It would feel so heavy for its size, you'd almost think it was like a trick or something. And the race for that densest element title was actually a really close one, wasn't it? It was. The podcast mentioned that whole osmium-iridium rivalry. How did scientists actually figure out which one was denser? Yeah, so they used X-ray crystallography. It's kind of like taking a super high-resolution 3D X-ray of the element's crystal structure. Wow. By looking at how those X-rays scatter off the atoms, scientists can figure out exactly how those atoms are arranged and spaced. And from that, they can figure out the density with incredible precision. So it's not just about weighing a chunk of metal on a scale. It's about looking deep inside the element. Exactly. At the atomic level to really understand its structure. Pretty impressive. Absolutely. And speaking of structure, it might surprise you to learn that while osmium is incredibly hard, it's also brittle. Okay. So unlike a diamond, which you can cut and shape, osmium is more likely to just shatter under pressure. So it's not just about being the strongest or hardest. It's about how those atoms are actually packed together. Okay, moving on from density. Did you know that osmium literally means smell in Greek? Yes. And that's all because of one of its compounds, osmium tetroxide. When osmium powder is exposed to air, it reacts with oxygen. And that reaction forms this compound, and it has a very distinct pungent odor. And osmium tetroxide isn't just smelly, it's pretty dangerous too, right? It is. It's highly toxic. Yeah. And it can cause some serious damage to your lungs, eyes, and skin. Wow. But this is where it gets kind of interesting. That same toxicity makes it incredibly useful in fingerprint detection. Hold on, you're telling me they use something this dangerous to, like, help solve crimes? Yeah. How does that even work? Well, so osmium tetroxide reacts with the lipids or the fats that are naturally present in fingerprints. This reaction actually makes the fingerprints visible, so investigators can gather crucial evidence at crime scenes. Wow. So this toxic compound that you wouldn't want anywhere near you is actually helping to catch criminals. That's wild. But is that all osmium is good for? No, not at all. It's a vital component in a range of applications, from high-durability alloys to advanced microscopy techniques. We also can't forget its role in a Nobel Prize-winning chemical reaction. Wait, Nobel Prize-winning? Okay, you're going to have to tell me more about that. Yeah. So it involves a reaction called the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation. Now, this might sound a little technical, but essentially it's a way to create very specific molecules that have a very particular 3D structure. It's like building with Legos, but on a molecular level, and osmium tetroxide plays a crucial role as a catalyst that makes that whole process possible. So a reaction that essentially revolutionized organic chemistry, and osmium was right there at the heart of it. That's impressive for an element that most people probably couldn't even point to on the periodic table. Right. But speaking of the periodic table, how rare is osmium? Incredibly rare. I mean, we're talking one of the least abundant elements in the Earth's crust. Just to give you an idea, imagine you have a pool filled with a trillion grains of sand. Only 50 of those grains would be osmium. Wow. Okay. That definitely puts things in perspective. Yeah. So where do we even find this element? The largest known reserves are actually in South Africa. In a geological formation called the Bushveld Igneous Complex, it's like Mother Nature just decided to concentrate a bunch of precious metals, including osmium, in one specific spot. There are also some smaller reserves in Russia and Canada. And I'm guessing that since it's so rare, it must be pretty valuable too, right? Gold or platinum. Absolutely. While the demand for osmium isn't as high as some other precious metals, its rarity and unique properties make it very valuable. You know, what's interesting is there's evidence that people were already using osmium alloys way back in pre-Columbian South America. Really? So we're talking about cultures working with this super rare, difficult to work with metal long before modern technology came into play. Exactly. Wow, that's amazing. It just goes to show human ingenuity and fascination with the elements. So we've got density, smell, toxicity, crime solving, Nobel Prizes, ancient civilizations. Yeah. And we're just getting started. In the next part of our deep dive, we'll dig deeper into why osmium is so rare and what actually brought it to Earth. Stay tuned. Welcome back to our osmium odyssey. We left off talking about how ancient civilizations were already using osmium alloys. Yeah. Which got me thinking, how did this element even get to Earth in the first place? Well, to understand that, we need to go way back, like way back to the stars. Okay. Osmium, just like a lot of other heavy elements, is actually formed in stars through a process called nuclear fusion. And this happens in the cores of stars, where it's incredibly hot and dense and lighter elements are literally fused together to create heavier ones. So osmium's story starts with these massive cosmic explosions billions of years ago. That's crazy. It is. And when those stars eventually explode as supernovae, all those newly formed elements, including osmium, are scattered out into space. And then over really, really long periods of time, this cosmic dust kind of comes together and forms new stars and planets and eventually everything we see around us. So every bit of osmium we find on Earth is basically stardust. Exactly. Remnants of ancient stars that died long before our planet even existed. That's a pretty cool thought. But even on Earth, osmium isn't evenly distributed, is it? No, not at all. We were talking about the Bushveld Complex in South Africa, having the largest reserves. Why is that? That has to do with plate tectonics, you know, that constant movement of Earth's crust. Millions of years ago, intense volcanic activity in that region brought molten rock, rich in osmium and other platinum group metals, up from deep within the Earth. And as this molten rock cooled and solidified, it formed the Bushveld Complex. And essentially that concentrated all that osmium in that specific area. So it's like Earth's own internal processes created this giant osmium deposit. So that makes me wonder, if we keep mining osmium at the rate we are, are we going to run out? Well, that's a question a lot of people are asking. Right. While osmium is super rare, we could always discover new deposits. That's true. However, the bigger issue is the environmental impact of mining. I mean, extracting osmium often involves some really intense processes that can be harmful to ecosystems. It's a classic dilemma, the need for these valuable resources versus protecting our planet. Right. It's about finding that balance. Maybe as technology advances, we'll find more sustainable ways to get it out of the ground. But even if we could mine it easily, is there even enough demand for osmium to justify all that effort? That's a good point. The demand for osmium is actually relatively low compared to metals like gold or platinum. Right. And that's because its uses are very specialized. You know, you're not going to find osmium in everyday objects like you do with gold or silver. So even though it's this incredibly dense, rare element with a wild origin story, it's not exactly a household name. Exactly. I mean, most people probably aren't thinking about the osmium alloy in their fountain pen tip or the crucial role it plays as a catalyst in certain chemical reactions. But in those very specific applications, you just you can't replace it. It's almost like osmium is this hidden champion of the periodic table, a behind the scenes player that's making a big impact in its own unique way. I like that. I'm finding myself more and more fascinated by osmium as we go deeper. It's like unraveling a mystery. Each new fact reveals another layer of complexity. That's the beauty of exploring the elements. Each one has its own story, its own characteristics that make it unique and essential to the universe as we know it. Osmium has certainly lived up to the hype from its cosmic origins to its role in Nobel Prize winning chemistry. It's been quite a journey. What's next on our osmium adventure? Well, in the final part of our deep dive, we're going to look ahead to osmium's future potential and the challenges that lie ahead. Get ready for some really thought provoking possibilities. All right, we're back for the final part of our osmium deep dive. We've gone from the heart of exploding stars to the depths of the Earth's crust. And along the way, osmium has proven to be anything but boring. But what about its future? I mean, where does an element like this go from here? That's the million dollar question, right
