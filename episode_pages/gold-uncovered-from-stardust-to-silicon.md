## Description

A deep dive into the astonishing story of goldâ€”from its cosmic birth in supernovae and neutron-star mergers to its earthly form. We explore what makes gold so special, its surprising uses beyond jewelry (electronics, medicine, and nanotech), and the cultural glow surrounding it, all while examining the environmental and ethical costs of mining.

## Transcript

Okay, ready to dive into gold, Dee? Let's do it. I've got these excerpts here, one from Wikipedia and the other from a website called Mining for Schools. Interesting combo. Yeah, and it looks like we're going way beyond the whole buy low, sell high thing with gold today. Oh yeah, definitely. We're going deep into the story of gold. From how it's made to some pretty surprising ways people use it that have nothing to do with jewelry. Should be fun. I know, right? Just to start, this totally blew my mind. What's that? Gold is literally stardust. Uh-huh. It's forged in these super intense events out in space. Supernovae. Exactly, supernovae. And neutron star collisions. Whoa, yeah, those too. So that gold ring you might be wearing, it could be billions of years old. All right. Crazy, right? It really is amazing when you think about it that way. So how does that even happen? How is gold made in these explosions? So the process is called the R process. R process, okay. And basically it's where atoms get bombarded with neutrons. Like a ton of neutrons. An unbelievable amount and at crazy high speed. And this only happens in the most extreme environments, like in supernovae and when neutron stars collide. Right, right. And what's really cool is that scientists have actually seen this happening. Really? Yeah, they observed these neutron star mergers and they detected the signature of gold being created like in real time. So we've literally witnessed gold being made out in space. Pretty much, yeah. Wow, that's incredible. It makes you think about gold differently, huh? Totally. Have you ever stopped to think about where the gold in like your jewelry or even your phone actually came from? I try not to. Makes my head spin a little, honestly. To think it was made billions of years ago in these huge cosmic events. That's mind blowing. For sure. But then how did that gold get to Earth? Right, good question. We've got gold out in space, but how did it end up down here? So the research mentions two main theories. Lay on me. Okay, so theory number one is that it came from asteroid impacts during something called the late heavy bombardment. Late heavy bombardment, sounds intense. It was. Basically, billions of years ago, Earth was constantly getting pummeled by asteroids. Ouch. And some scientists believe those asteroids carried gold with them. Like a cosmic delivery service. Uh-huh, kind of. Then there's the second theory, which says gold was already part of Earth's makeup from the beginning. Hmm, interesting. Yeah, that it was deep down in the Earth's mantle and somehow made its way up to the surface over time. So it was either raining down on us from space or already here all along hidden deep underground. Right. Is there any evidence to support either of these ideas? Actually, yeah, there is. Okay, tell me more. So have you heard of the Vredefort impact structure in South Africa? Vredefort, it rings a bell vaguely. It's the biggest confirmed impact crater on Earth. Oh, wow. From this massive asteroid, probably like 10 to 15 kilometers wide, that hit Earth over 2 billion years ago. That's huge. Yeah, it left a crater almost 300 kilometers across. I can't even imagine. And near this crater is the Witwatersrand Basin, which happens to be the richest gold deposit on Earth. Oh, really? At first, scientists thought the impact might have brought the gold. Makes sense. But it turns out the gold deposits are actually hundreds of millions of years older than the impact itself. Oh, so that rules that out then. For that location at least. But hold on, this is wild. What is it? 22% of all the gold ever mined comes from this one place. What? From just the Witwatersrand Basin? Yeah. That's insane. It is. So while the asteroid theory might not explain the Witwatersrand, it could still be how gold got to other parts of Earth. Right. And there's actually some really cool evidence for that second theory, too, the one about gold being in the mantle. Okay, what is it? There was a study where they found evidence of gold coming up from the mantle to the surface in Argentina. Oh, wow. Which supports the idea that some gold might have been inside Earth all along. So we've got gold potentially coming from asteroids and gold emerging from inside the Earth. A real planetary treasure hunt. Totally. But let's move on from gold's origins for a bit. What makes gold so special besides its crazy history? Why has it been so sought after throughout history? Well, it all comes down to its properties. Right. Like it's super malleable. Exactly. The research mentioned that a single gram of gold can be beaten into a sheet a whole square meter. Big. Thinner than paper. Thinner than paper. And with gold leaf, they can make it even thinner. How thin are we talking? So thin that some greenish-blue light can actually pass through it. No way. It's pretty remarkable. Gold is just so versatile, isn't it? For sure. It's the most malleable metal we know of. And then there's its conductivity. Oh, yeah. Amazing conductor of both heat and electricity. Plus, it's incredibly dense, almost as dense as tungsten. You know, that's actually how some people try to fake gold bars. Really? Yeah. They take a tungsten bar and coat it in gold. Because the density is so similar. Exactly. It's a sneaky trick to try and fool people. Wow. Never would have thought of that. But, of course, the most recognizable thing about gold is its color, that beautiful reddish-yellow. Yeah, that classic gold color. What gives it that specific shade? This might surprise you, but it's actually pretty unusual given its atomic structure. Really? Most metals with a similar structure would have a totally different color. And the reason gold looks the way it does is due to something called relativistic effects. Relativistic effects. Is that, like, related to Einstein's theory of relativity? Exactly. You see, these effects are usually only seen in the ultraviolet range for most metals, but gold is different. Different how? The way light interacts with gold's electrons is changed by these relativistic effects, and that shifts its absorption and reflection properties. Shifting them into the visible spectrum. Right, which is why we see it as that specific golden color. So the color of gold is basically thanks to Einstein's theory of relativity. It's wild, isn't it? That's mind-blowing. It's amazing how physics plays a role in even the most ordinary things. In all these unique properties, its color, its malleability, its density, and its resistance to corrosion, they've all contributed to gold's historical and cultural significance. Absolutely. I mean, it's been associated with so much throughout history. Divinity, perfection, achievement. Think about the golden ratio in art and architecture. Oh, yeah. Or the use of gold in religious imagery. And, of course, those coveted gold medals. Exactly. Gold has always held this special place in human societies. It represents something so much more than just, you know, a lump of metal. It's a symbol of power, beauty, even immortality. But, you know, let's shift gears for a second. Okay. I was actually really surprised to learn how much gold is used in electronics. It's not just for looks, right? Yeah, it's not just about aesthetics. Gold is actually crucial for reliable connections in things like computers and phones. Absolutely. Gold's conductivity and resistance to corrosion make it essential for electronics. It makes sure all those tiny connections stay reliable and there's no signal loss. Right. Think of it as the unsung hero of the digital age. So basically, when I think of my phone, I should also be thinking about gold. Uh-huh. Pretty much. But wait, there's another unexpected use of gold. Oh, no. Medicine. You're kidding. Nope. Gold is used in medicine. Tell me more. Well, it actually has a long history of being used in medicine, going all the way back to ancient civilizations. Really? So are people still swallowing gold coins for their health? Uh-huh. No, not quite. Okay, good. These days, it's specific gold compounds that are used, not the metal itself. Makes more sense. Yeah. And these gold compounds have anti-inflammatory properties. So they can help with pain and swelling? Exactly. They're used to treat conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Wow, I had no idea. And get this. Researchers are even looking into using gold nanoparticles to treat cancer. Gold nanoparticles fighting cancer. That's straight out of a sci-fi movie. I know, right? Yeah. It's still in the research phase, but it has huge potential. That's amazing. And speaking of surprising uses, did you know some really fancy cocktails actually have gold flakes in them? Gold flakes in my martini. Now that's what I call luxury. Exactly. I guess it's more for the visual effect than anything else, but still. Pretty cool. So we've got gold in supernovae, smartphones, and even cocktails. This element really gets around. It's a truly versatile element. It really is. But, you know, it's important to remember that gold, like a lot of things that glitter, also has a darker side. That's true. We can't ignore the environmental and social costs that often come with gold mining. Absolutely. We need to be aware of the full picture. Exactly. The way gold is extracted can have a huge impact on the environment, especially because of the use of toxic chemicals like cyanide. Yeah, cyanide is incredibly dangerous. It's extremely poisonous, isn't it? It is. It's used to dissolve gold from the ore. But any
