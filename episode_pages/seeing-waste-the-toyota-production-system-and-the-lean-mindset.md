## Description

What if continuous improvement isnâ€™t about working harder, but spotting waste others miss? We unpack Toyotaâ€™s Production Systemâ€”the ideas of muda, mura, muriâ€”and the two pillars JIT and jidoka, plus kaizen, genchi genbutsu, and hansei. Explore nonprofit case studies and learn how to apply these lessons to your own projects by turning friction into value.

## Transcript

What if the real secret to getting better, you know, evolving continuously, wasn't about just working harder? What if it was about seeing waste, basically, where other people just don't see it? Today we're diving deep into the Toyota Production System, TPS. It's this blueprint that absolutely revolutionized manufacturing, and honestly, it's still shaping industries way beyond cars. Think of it as the big precursor to lean manufacturing. Oh, absolutely. And the origin story as well is quite something. Toyota developed it themselves, mostly between, say, 1948 and 1975. It built on ideas from Kiichiro Toyota, but engineers like Taiichi Ohno really spearheaded it. Their core mission was, well, relentless design out frictions, specifically three things, muri, that's overburden, mura inconsistency, and muda, which just means waste. So it's not just finding problems later, it's this systemic commitment, almost philosophical, to designing out the friction beforehand. Our mission here is to really get how TPS helps strip away anything that doesn't add value, turning problems into opportunities, really. Okay, let's unpack that concept of muda waste. That seems absolutely central. You said there were different kinds. One was the biggest. Yeah, they identified eight kinds, but the absolute largest, the one causing the most trouble downstream, is overproduction. Overproduction. See, that sounds wrong. Don't most businesses want to make as much as possible? Why did Toyota see that as the main enemy? Exactly. Because overproduction, well, it doesn't just waste resources itself, it actually hides all the other kinds of waste. Oh, okay. Like what? Things like defects, waiting time, unnecessary movement, too much inventory. You know, it's like a flooded basement floor hiding where the actual pipe leaks are. By forcing themselves to stop overproducing, TPS basically shines a spotlight on those other underlying problems, makes them impossible to ignore. It's about tackling issues many companies just sort of live with. That's a really key idea, actively making problems visible so you have to solve them. So how did they build a whole system around this? Right, that gets us to the two big pillars, just in time, JIT, and jidoka, sometimes called autonomation, and they really work together. Just in time, that's the one about making only what is needed, only when it is needed, and only in the amount that is needed. Right, and the fascinating part is the inspiration came from an American supermarket, not another car factory. Yes. That supermarket visit was apparently a huge light bulb moment. Instead of the old way of pushing out products based on forecasts. And hoping they sell. Exactly, they saw how a customer just pulls what they want off the shelf, and the store only restocks what was taken. It flipped the whole manufacturing model. So the customer's demand dictates production, not some prediction. Precisely. It wasn't just about efficiency, though that was huge. It dramatically cut inventory waste, tied up capital, the risk of stuff becoming obsolete. Taiichi Ono even said, it is a problem when parts are delivered too early. Think about that. Too early is a problem. Okay, so JIT handles making only what's needed. What about jidoka? What's automation with a human touch mean, practically? Jidoka isn't just about machines doing work. It's about building quality in. If a problem or a defect happens, the machine stops automatically. But crucially, a person steps in to figure out the root cause right then and there. So it stops bad parts from continuing down the line. Exactly. And it builds this culture where quality is everyone's job at every step, not just some inspection at the very end. Imagine the, I don't know, the discipline required to stop a whole line for one small issue. Most places would freak out. Toyota saw it as a chance to learn and prevent a bigger problem later. And these big ideas, they're wrapped up in what Toyota calls the Toyota Way, right? With concepts like kaizen, continuous improvement. And genchi genbutsu. Which means? Going to the actual place, the source, to see the facts for yourself before you decide anything. No armchair decisions. And all this drives incredible organizational learning. It's about solving root causes, not just symptoms. They use relentless reflection, hansei, looking critically at what went wrong. Not to blame people, but to learn systemically. It's a system designed to just keep getting better. So, okay, this is fascinating for manufacturing, but what's the impact beyond that? Does this TPS stuff actually work elsewhere? Oh, absolutely. It's surprising how broadly it applies. Toyota has actually donated its system, even its engineers, to help nonprofits improve. Seriously? Like what kind of nonprofits? Well, take the food bank for New York City. Okay. Toyota engineers went there. Genchi genbutsu, right? Yeah. Saw huge muda, waste, in sorting and packing food. They streamlined workflows, applied JIT principles to distribution, and the result was huge drops in waiting times at soup kitchens, faster packing. Just a much more efficient help. Wow. Any other examples? Yeah, another great one is SBP. They're a disaster relief group, rebuilding homes. They use Kaizen events, really analyzing every step. They found bottlenecks, inconsistencies, mura. And get this, they cut their average home rebuild time from like 12, 18 weeks down to just six weeks. Six weeks. That's incredible. And cut construction errors by half, just by applying these Toyota methods. Okay. That really shows the power isn't just about cars. Which kind of raises a big question, doesn't it? How could this core philosophy, spotting and ditching mura, mura, and muri, the waste, inconsistency, overburden, how could you apply that, you know, in your own life? Your projects, your daily routines maybe, not just in a factory. That's a really interesting thought to leave everyone with. Where do you see waste or friction in your own processes? Could be a habit, an extra step you don't need, even just inconsistency in how you do things. Something to think about.
