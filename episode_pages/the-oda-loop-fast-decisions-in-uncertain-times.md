## Transcript

Welcome to a deep dive. We're digging into some sources you sent over, all looking at, well, how to make better, faster decisions when everything feels unpredictable. Right, it's a common challenge. And we're focusing today on this framework, the ODA loop, which surprisingly started with fighter pilots. We'll see how it applies now to business, especially supply chains, using an educational publishing example. And then the really fascinating part, how AI, maybe using Python, can actually run this loop. Like building AI agents to manage complex supply chains way faster than we could alone. Exactly. So our mission today, really get our heads around ODA, see it in action managing things like textbook stock, and then explore how AI makes it tick. It's about cutting to the noise, making quicker, smarter calls, and, you know, getting an edge, hopefully turning that feeling of information overload into a clear path forward. Okay, let's start with the ODA loop itself. Its roots are military, specifically U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd, a bit of a legend, apparently. He studied fighter pilots, trying to figure out why some just consistently won dogfights. And his insight was, it wasn't just reflexes or the plane, it was about decision speed, getting inside the other guy's decision cycle. So outthinking and outacting them, cycle faster. Precisely. Observe what's happening, figure out what it means, orient, decide what to do, and act fast. And crucially, your action changes things, so you immediately observe again. It's a constant loop. Okay, let's break down those four steps the sources detail. First up is observe. Observe is basically gathering the raw data, unbiased info from everywhere possible. You need the full picture. Like radar visuals for a pilot. Yeah, and in business. So sales numbers, inventory, yes, but also market trends, what competitors are doing, customer feedback, even economic news. For an AI agent, this means hitting databases, APIs, sensor feeds, constantly pulling in fresh data. It's all about building real-time situational awareness. Got it. Collect everything. But raw data can be overwhelming. That brings us to orient. You said this was the crucial one. Boyd thought so, and the sources agree. Orient is where you make sense of it all. You filter that raw data, analyze it, put it in context. You connect it with what you already know, your past experiences. So it's not just what the data says, but what it means for you right now. Exactly. Finding the patterns, the trends, the weird outliers. What's the implication? And AI does this with data processing, running models, machine learning, identifying things humans might miss, looking at historical context. It's answering, okay, with all this coming in, what's really going on? Okay, makes sense. You've seen the situation, you've oriented, understood it. Now you have to decide. Right. Time to choose a course of action based on that understanding. You look at your options. What could you do? What are the risks? What resources will it take? What are the likely outcomes? The sources said quickly, but not hastily. Yeah, that's key. It has to be informed by orient, but you can't get stuck analyzing forever. Perfection is the enemy here. An AI might use decision rules, run quick simulations if we do X, what happens, or use optimization algorithms to pick the best path based on goals. The output is a concrete decision, a plan. And then the final piece, act. Put the plan into motion. Act is implementation. Execute the decision. Launch the campaign, change the production schedule, move the inventory. For an AI, it's sending the command, trigger the reorder, update the setting, reroute the truck. And this feeds right back into observe, right? Closing the loop. Critically important. Your action changes the situation. So you immediately start observing the effects. Did it work? What's different now? That feedback drives the next cycle. You're constantly learning, refining. So the real power isn't just the steps. It's doing them repeatedly, continuously, and faster than things are changing around you or faster than your competitors. That's the core idea. Faster, more effective cycles give you the advantage. You adapt quicker. Which sounds incredibly relevant to business today. The sources mention this term, VUCA. Right, VUCA. Volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous. Basically describes the crazy, unpredictable world businesses operate in now. Things change fast. It's hard to predict. Lots of moving parts. Cause and effect isn't always clear. Sounds about right. And ODA is almost tailor-made for that. It's a framework for thriving in that kind of dynamic environment, not just surviving it. So how does it map practically to a general business situation? It maps really well. Observe is your market intelligence, your KPIs, tracking sales, supply chain movements, customer chatter, competitor actions. Think like a retailer watching website traffic and social media buzz in real time. Okay. Orient is the analysis. Why are sales up in Florida? How will that shipping crisis affect our parts? Using analytics, experience, maybe SWOT analysis to get actionable insights. Right, making sense of the observations. Then decide is making the call. Adjust pricing. Shift marketing spend. Change suppliers. ODO pushes for making these calls fast with the best info you have now. Not waiting for certainty that might never come. Exactly. And act is executing it. Updating the website, briefing the sales team, signing the new supplier contract. And immediately you're back to observing the results. Yeah. How did customers react? Did costs go down? It creates this continuous feedback loop. That feedback seems key for agility. It is. It lets companies react to shifts way faster than rigid, slow processes allow. Those sources mention leaders like Jamie Dimon using this kind of thinking for rapid scenario planning. It applies everywhere. Strategy, operations, marketing. But it's especially potent in complex, fast-moving areas like supply chains. Which leads us nicely to that educational publishing case study. Why is that specific industry such a good fit for ODA? Oh, it's perfect. Educational publishing faces intense seasonality back-to-school rushes. Big inventory risks. Print too many textbooks, you lose money. Print too few, you lose sales and anger schools. Yeah, I can see that. Plus, unpredictable demand shifts from new curriculum adoptions or big state contracts. And complex logistics getting physical books everywhere on time. It's a dynamic puzzle. Needs constant watching and quick adjustments. That's pure ODA territory. Okay, let's walk through the loop in that context. Observe in an educational publisher's supply chain, what are they looking at? They're gathering everything. Internal stuff, inventory levels in every warehouse, sales orders coming in, back orders piling up, where books are in the printing process. But crucially, external signals. Leading indicators. Course enrollment projections from colleges. Huge school district adoption announcements. That's a massive signal, often months ahead. News about education funding changes. What competitors are releasing. And the sources emphasize demand sensing using near real-time data. What kind of data? Website clicks on specific textbook pages. Inquiries logged by sales reps. Early orders trickling in. Even social media buzz or search trends around certain subjects. You're trying to spot demand shifts as they start. Not just when the big orders land. Catching those faint signals early is vital input. Okay, so a ton of data streams coming in. Internal, external, subtle, digital signals. How do they orient with all that? That sounds like the hard part. It is. This is analysis and forecasting. So observe flags an unusual spike in website hits for a chemistry book in California. Orient asks why. Did California just update its science standards? You combine that real-time signal with history. This book usually sells X in California in the fall. And your team's knowledge of adoption cycles. So connecting the dots. Exactly. And using forecasting models. Statistical ones. Maybe machine learning trained on years of sales data. Predicting demand for every single title. Maybe even by region. You're also analyzing logistics. Are printers running late? Is the stock sitting in New Jersey when the demand spike is in Texas? Can AI help find patterns here? Definitely. AI might spot a correlation between, say, online forum discussions about a new teaching method and subsequent orders for a specific workbook. Something a human analyst might miss. The goal of Orient is a clear picture. Current situation, solid demand forecasts, and identified risks. Like, warning, probability of stocking out of 7th grade math in the southeast is 80% within 4 weeks. Okay, that's a clear actionable insight. Which leads to decide. What do you do about that likely stock out? Now you formulate options. Do we rush an extra print run of 20,000 copies? Can we pull 5,000 copies from the Midwest warehouse where demand looks softer and truck them southeast? Is there a digital alternative we can promote harder in that region? Weighing the costs and benefits. Right. Cost, speed, likelihood of success. AI can be a huge help here, running quick simulations. Okay, model the impact of printing 15K versus transferring 8K. Show me projected inventory levels, total costs, and backorder risk for both scenarios next month. This helps choose the best option fast, but based on data, aligning with goals like service level targets or cost minimization. The output is a specific plan. Initiate reprint of 15K math books, expedite transfer of 3K science books from west coast to southeast. And the final step, act, is making that happen in the physical supply chain. Yep, execute the plan. Send the PO to the printer, issue the transfer orders to the warehouses, update the inventory management system so everyone sees the plan. Speed matters. Schools need those books by a certain date. And then you watch closely. Immediately. Is the print order confirmed?
