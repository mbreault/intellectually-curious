## Description

From its synthetic birth in a collider to the hunt for stable isotopes, Copernicium tests the boundaries of chemistry. Weâ€™ll unpack its discovery, its fleeting existence, and how relativistic effects might reshape its behaviorâ€”possibly a noble metal, maybe a noble gas in disguise. Plus, the tantalizing island of stability that could someday unlock longer-lived superheavy elements, and the science, drama, and curiosity driving this frontier.

## Transcript

All right, so get ready. We're going deep on copernicium today. Oh, that's a fun one. Yeah. You know, I've been looking over all this stuff, Wikipedia, some articles on the history, and I got to say, I'm already hooked. I mean, this element, it's completely synthetic, so it's never found in nature. And then on top of that, it's like insanely radioactive. It's true. It's like the rock star of the elements, you know? Mysterious and maybe a little dangerous. I like that. Yeah, it pushes the boundaries of what we know about chemistry for sure. Okay, so before we get into like all the nitty gritty, can you give us like the copernicium 101? Like what is this thing? Absolutely. So copernicium, its symbol is CN, and it has an atomic number of 112. So that means it has 112 protons in its nucleus, which puts it way down there on the periodic table with the heavyweights. It's in the D block, specifically group 12, and it's classified as a transactinide element. Transactinide, okay. I mean, that already sounds intense. Is that because it's synthetic? Like is that part of what makes it a transactinide? That is part of it. So all of its known isotopes are radioactive, and they decay incredibly quickly. Wow. The most stable one, copernicium 285, has a half-life of about 30 seconds. So to put that in perspective, imagine trying to study something that disappears faster than you can make a cup of coffee. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's fleeting. Yeah. So, I mean, how do scientists even create something that doesn't exist naturally? Right. This isn't like baking soda and vinegar, right? We're talking high-level stuff here. No, we're talking about using a heavy ion accelerator, and it smashes atoms together at incredibly high speeds. So it's like a microscopic demolition derby. Yeah, yeah, but with a purpose. Okay, I like that. All right, so which elements are we smashing? Right. What are they using to make copernicium? So in 1996, researchers at the GSI Helmholtz Center in Germany, they created copernicium 277 by colliding lead and zinc atoms. Lead and zinc? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Huh. I would have thought, I don't know, something much more exotic. Right. Something rarer to make something like copernicium. It's really more about the nuclear properties and how they interact during the collision than what the actual elements are. So you can take common elements, smash them together in the right way, and get brand new elements. That's pretty cool. Okay, so they smashed lead and zinc, boom, copernicium, end of story, right? Well, we're... Or is there more to this? The path to scientific discovery is rarely straightforward. Initially, there was some controversy because one of the scientists involved, Victor Ninov, was found to have fabricated some of the data. It became a real scientific whodunit. Hold on, wait. Fabricated data? That's like a cardinal sin in science. It's a big no-no, yeah. So how did copernicium get its official, like, you know, stamp of approval after that? Right, so that's where the importance of independent confirmation comes in. Another team, this time at RIKEN in Japan, they replicated the experiment and confirmed that copernicium was real. They validated the original findings, minus the, you know, fabricated data. Right, right. So it was a huge relief for the scientific community. Yeah, I bet. And eventually, IUPAC, which is kind of the governing body for chemistry, officially recognized copernicium as an element in 2009. 2009, so that's over a decade from, like, first creation to actually being like, okay, this is legit. That's a long time. Science moves carefully. Yeah, it does, it does. Okay, so we know it exists, but what do we actually know? Right, so that's the tricky part. It's so short-lived that studying its properties is a little like trying to watch a firework that vanishes in a blink. But scientists have made some predictions. Ooh, predictions, I like predictions. What are they thinking? What are they saying about this element? So based on its position on the periodic table and a bunch of theoretical calculations, copernicium is predicted to be an extremely noble metal. Noble metal? Like, you mean like gold and platinum? Exactly. Okay, so is it shiny? Is it valuable? Well, it might be. We can't really say for sure without, you know, observing it directly. Right, of course. But here's what's interesting. Copernicium is predicted to be even more noble than gold. Really? Its theoretical reduction potential is crazy high, which suggests it would be extremely resistant to reacting with other substances. So like gold tarnishes eventually, right? Right. Would copernicium just stay pristine, like, forever? It's possible. That's mind-blowing. Okay, so hold on, now it gets even wilder, right? It does. Because you were saying something before about it maybe having properties similar to like radon. Yeah, some predictions suggest that. And radon's a noble gas. Exactly. So wait, hold on. We were talking noble metal. Now we're talking noble gas. This thing's all over the place. I know, right? How can one element be so unpredictable? Well, you have to remember, copernicium is a relativistic element. Okay. So the electrons orbiting its nucleus are moving so fast that they're actually impacted by Einstein's theory of relativity. Wait, Einstein? Like the E equals E times time? The one and only? What does relativity have to do with an element? It all comes down to speed. In these really heavy elements like copernicium, the electrons are moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. Wow. And because of that, because of that speed, their mass actually increases. No way. Yeah. It's one of the crazy things about elements on the edge of the periodic table. Okay, I need a minute to process that. Electrons gaining weight because they're speed demons? Yeah. That's a whole new level of weird. But how does this relativistic effect make it act like a noble gas? Right, so think of it this way. Imagine a tiny race car, right, and it's whipping around a track so fast. Okay, yeah. That it actually starts to get heavier. That's kind of what's happening. I like that analogy. I can see it. To the electrons in copernicium, they get this relativistic speed boost, and it changes their energy levels. Okay. And how they interact with other atoms, which can lead to some unexpected chemical properties. So it's like they're breaking the rules of chemistry because they're on this relativistic joyride? Pretty much. Okay, I'm with you. Yeah. But I'm still not clear how that explains the noble gas thing. Okay, so this is still being researched. Yeah. But one idea is that these relativistic effects could be making copernicium's outermost electron shell more tightly bound to the nucleus. Right. And if that happens, it would make it less likely to want to interact with other atoms, similar to how noble gases act. You know, they don't really want to react with much. So copernicium's electrons are like holding on for dear life. Kind of, yeah. As they're zipping around the nucleus, making the whole atom less reactive. That's a good way to think about it. That is wild. It really is. It's like a whole frontier of chemistry, and there's so much we still don't know. Yeah. But, you know, the fact that we're even seeing these relativistic effects is incredibly exciting. It opens up so many possibilities for understanding and maybe even manipulating matter in ways we never thought possible. You know, it's easy to get lost in the weeds talking about electrons and relativity. Right. But I think it's cool to, like, step back for a second and remember that we're talking about an element that humans made. That's right. It doesn't exist naturally, right? It doesn't. We're witnessing, like, the birth of a new piece of the universe, essentially. I love that. Yeah, it's a testament to human ingenuity, our curiosity. Absolutely. It challenges what we think is possible. Yeah. Pushes the boundaries of science. So speaking of pushing boundaries, you mentioned something earlier called the island of stability. Oh, yeah! And I want to get back to that. Sure. What exactly is this island, and what does it have to do with copernicium? So imagine you have a map of all the elements, right? Okay. Most of them are on stable ground. Okay, yeah. But then way out in the distance, there's this mysterious island. Okay. On this island, you might find super heavy elements like copernicium, but in forms that are much more stable than we expect. So instead of, like, vanishing in seconds, they could exist for, I don't know, days, years. Potentially, yeah. That's a game changer for scientists who want to study them. Huge game changer. So are you saying there's a chance that copernicium could be on this island? Some calculations suggest that certain isotopes of copernicium might be there. Okay, so it's a real possibility. It is. It's like a scientific treasure hunt, searching for these stable forms of these super heavy elements. So if we find a stable isotope of copernicium, what would that even mean for science? Like, what could we do? I mean, it would
