## Transcript

Welcome back to Science Corner. For those just joining us, this is our deep dive series for all of you fellow intellectually curious amateur scientists out there. Pleasure to be here. We've got an exciting one today, folks. We're going to the moon, and maybe even Mars. But not literally, of course. Not yet, at least. Well, yeah, not yet, right. But we are going to be talking about building on those worlds. So lunar and Martian construction. Construction, exactly. Now you can't exactly just, you know, order up some bricks and mortar from Home Depot and ship them off to space. Right, that would be slightly cost prohibitive, to say the least. To say the least, yeah. I mean, the logistics of launching tons and tons of material from Earth, that's just not feasible. Absolutely not. It's just not practical on a large scale. So we got to get creative. We got to think outside the box. And that's where these fascinating ideas for extraterrestrial concrete come in. Lunarcrete. Lunarcrete. Astrocrete. Getchy names, huh? They do have a certain ring to them. And you know what's really wild? This isn't some brand new concept hot off the presses. No, not at all. The idea of using lunar dust to make concrete lunarcrete goes back decades, to 1985 to be precise. A fella named Larry Beyer, he really got the ball rolling. He did. And his focus was spot on utilizing in-situ resources. In-situ meaning using what's already there on the moon. Exactly. Every kilogram we can avoid launching from Earth is a huge win. So let's break down this lunarcrete, shall we? We all know how concrete works here on Earth, right? You've got your aggregate, your water, and your cement. Mix it all up, and bam, you've got yourself a solid foundation. Pretty straightforward. But on the moon, things get a little trickier, to say the least. Just a bit, yes. First of all, aggregate. That's basically just, you know, rocky bits, right? Essentially, yes. The bulk of the material. On the moon, we've got lunar regolith, that fine, powdery dust that covers everything. Abundant and readily available. Now, we've brought back some lunar regolith from the Apollo missions, but not exactly mountains of it. No, not enough to start building lunar cities, unfortunately. So researchers here on Earth, they get creative. They use simulants. Simulant materials that mimic the properties of lunar regolith. Things like volcanic ash, or these special mixes with names like JSC-1 and LHS-1. They're stand-ins for the real deal. And they allow us to conduct experiments and refine our techniques here on Earth before attempting them on the moon. Makes sense, right? Practice makes perfect, even when it comes to lunar concrete. Okay, so we've got our aggregate sorted, or at least we have a good idea where to get it. What about the cement? That's the glue that holds it all together. Crucial component, yes. And unfortunately, there aren't any ready-made bags of lunar cement lying around. Right, no lunar cement factories, as far as we know. Not yet, anyway. So how do we get around that? Well, we know that lunar rocks contain minerals that are rich in calcium. Calcium, huh? And calcium, when processed correctly, can be used to manufacture a type of cement. Interesting. So we're talking about basically extracting and processing these minerals from the lunar rocks. Precisely. A process called beneficiation. It would require specialized equipment and energy, of course, but the raw materials appear to be readily available. Okay, so we've got our aggregate, we've got our cement. Now what about water? That seems like it would be a pretty precious commodity on the moon. It certainly is. And essential for traditional concrete, which relies on a chemical reaction with water for hardening. Right, the hydration process. Exactly. So for lunar concrete, we have a couple options. One, we could transport water from Earth. Which, as we discussed, is not the most cost-effective approach. Not ideal, no. The other option, which is much more intriguing from a sustainability standpoint, is to find water on the moon itself. And the good news is, we have strong evidence of water ice trapped in permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles. So we could potentially mine that ice and use it for our concrete. Exactly. It's a promising avenue for a more self-sufficient approach. And there's even research into extracting hydrogen from lunar soil and combining it with oxygen to create water. Wow, that's getting pretty creative using chemistry to make your own water. It's all about utilizing what's available to us. For example, reacting hydrogen with ilmenite, a titanium-iron oxide found in abundance on the moon, could yield titanium oxide, iron, and as a byproduct, water. Very clever. So we're talking about building a whole closed-loop system up there, right? Using lunar resources to create the very things we need to build with. It's amazing. Now, we've talked about the theory, but have there been any, you know, actual attempts to make lunarcrete? Oh, absolutely. Back in the 1980s, a team led by Dr. T.D. Lin conducted some groundbreaking experiments. Okay, tell me more. They used actual lunar regolith brought back from the Apollo 16 mission, mixed it with water, and cured it with steam. And what happened? They created lunarcrete. And what's more, it was strong. Very strong. How strong are we talking? Their samples reached a compressive strength of 75 megapascals. Wow. Now, for our listeners who aren't concrete experts... 75 megapascals is comparable to, or even stronger than, the concrete we use in many buildings and bridges here on Earth. So this lunarcrete is the real deal. It shows immense promise. And what was also encouraging was that the lunarcrete showed minimal strength loss even after repeated exposure to vacuum conditions. Okay, so it can hold up in the harsh lunar environment. It appears so. And Lin even proposed a clever method for generating that steam on the moon, using the hydrogen reaction with ilmenite that we discussed earlier. So a closed-loop system again. Very elegant. But I imagine there are still some challenges to overcome. It's not exactly easy to just mix and pour concrete in a vacuum, right? You're absolutely right. The lack of atmosphere on the moon poses significant engineering hurdles. One of the biggest is the rapid sublimation of water in a vacuum. Sublimation. Basically, the water would instantly turn from ice to vapor, bypassing the liquid phase altogether. So it would just boil away before you could even mix it with the concrete. Exactly. So researchers have proposed a couple of potential solutions. One is to pre-mix the dry lunar regolith and lunar cement here on Earth. Okay, so send up the dry ingredients. Right. And then once on the moon, inject steam into the mixture in a controlled environment. Interesting. So kind of like a giant lunar pressure cooker for concrete. In a way, yes. The other approach involves setting up a pressurized concrete fabrication plant on the moon. So essentially a sealed habitat where you could mix and cast concrete blocks under controlled atmospheric conditions. Precisely. Both scenarios, of course, require significant infrastructure development on the moon. Right. It's not going to be easy. And let's not forget another fundamental challenge, like regular concrete. Lunarcrete is great under compression, being squeezed. Strong in compression, yes. But not so much when it comes to tension being pulled apart. That's a common limitation of concrete, both on Earth and on the moon. So how do we reinforce lunar structures to withstand those pulling forces? One intriguing idea is to use lunar glass fibers. We could potentially manufacture these from the abundant lunar regolith. Sort of like fiberglass, but made from moon dust. Exactly. Another interesting concept is to import Kevlar from Earth. Kevlar, like in bulletproof vests. The very same. It's incredibly strong for its weight. And in the context of space travel, mass efficiency is everything. Transporting a small amount of Kevlar for tensioning elements might actually be more cost effective than trying to produce a similar material from lunar resources. Interesting trade-off. So we're talking about strategically combining Earth-sourced materials with lunar resources. Okay, so that's lunarcrete. Now let's move on to a completely different concept, sulfur concrete. This one caught my eye because it claims to be waterless. And given all the challenges of sourcing and handling water on the moon, that sounds pretty appealing. It does have certain advantages in that regard, and we have reason to believe that sulfur is present on the moon. Where would we find it? Most likely in the mineral troilite, which is iron sulfide. Now the interesting thing about sulfur is that it melts at a relatively low temperature, and as it cools and solidifies, it acts as a very effective binder. So no complex chemical reactions like the hydration process we need for traditional cement? No, it's more of a physical process. The sulfur acts as a thermoplastic, hardening as it cools. And that means it gains strength pretty quickly, right? Exactly. And the lack of a traditional curing process could be a huge advantage for lunar construction. Less time spent on the surface for astronauts. Makes sense. Safety first, always. But does this sulfur concrete hold up in terms of strength? Studies using lunar regolith simulants have shown promising results. An optimal mixture seems to be around 65% simulant and 35% sulfur. And that gives you a compressive strength of... Around 34 megapascals. Okay, not quite as strong as the lunarcrete we talked about earlier, but still pretty impressive. And researchers have found that adding small percentages of materials like metal, fibers, or silica can further
