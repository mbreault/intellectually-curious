## Transcript

Welcome to another deep dive. Today, we're taking a trip to the edge of the periodic table, exploring the strange world of nihonium, an element so elusive it practically disappears right after it's made. You wanted to learn more about nihonium, and let me tell you, getting up to speed on this topic was mind-blowing, even for me. It's a story of atomic hide-and-seek with scientists acting as detectives, chasing these fleeting atoms and piecing together clues from their radioactive decay. What's so captivating about nihonium is that it's a synthetic element. It doesn't exist naturally anywhere on Earth. Scientists have to create it in a lab, atom by atom, and they only have fractions of a second to study it before it decays into something else. I'm already picturing scientists huddled around monitors, watching these tiny atomic fireworks. But before we get into the nitty-gritty of the discovery, I have to ask, how do you even begin to make an element? It sounds like something out of science fiction. It all starts with nuclear fusion. Think of it like forcing two magnets together, the ones that repel each other. You need an incredible amount of energy to overcome that repulsion and get them to fuse. In this case, we're talking about smashing atomic nuclei together, the very hearts of atoms. Okay, so we're talking about massive particle accelerators, right? Like those behemoths you see in documentaries. Smashing atoms together at nearly the speed of light. That's one way to do it. And there are a couple of approaches to this atomic smash-up. There's hot fusion, where you slam a lighter element into a heavier one at extremely high speeds. This creates a super excited, very unstable nucleus. It's like a hot potato that wants to cool down by shedding energy and particles. And that's where the decay chain comes in, right? It's like a trail of breadcrumbs leading back to the original element. But you mentioned another approach, cold fusion. What's the difference? Good point. And yes, the decay chain is key to identifying these fleeting elements. With cold fusion, we use heavier projectiles and lighter targets. This leads to less excited, slightly longer-lived nuclei. But they're still incredibly unstable. So it seems like scientists are walking this tightrope between creating an element and making sure it doesn't vanish before they can even get a good look at it. What makes nihonium such a challenge to create? Well, the challenge with superheavy elements like nihonium is that the more protons you pack into a nucleus, the more unstable it becomes. It's like trying to build a tower with blocks that keep repelling each other. You need the right building blocks and a very delicate touch. And this is where calcium-48 comes into play, right? Yeah. I read that this particular isotope of calcium is a bit of a secret weapon in the world of element creation. Exactly. Calcium-48 is what physicists call doubly magic. This means it has a special combination of protons and neutrons. That makes its nucleus incredibly stable. When you use calcium-48 as a projectile in fusion reactions, some of that stability can actually transfer to the newly formed superheavy element. It's like calcium-48 is donating some of its stability, giving the new element a fighting chance, even if it's just for a fleeting moment. That's brilliant. It is. Think of it like a skilled architect who knows just the right way to support a delicate structure. In the case of nihonium, calcium-48 helps to prop up that unstable nucleus, giving scientists those precious few milliseconds to observe it. This is already shaping up to be a fascinating detective story. So tell me, who were the key players in this scientific race? To create and identify nihonium, was it a single team or were there multiple groups hot on the trail? Actually, the story of nihonium involves a bit of a scientific showdown. It starts with early attempts to create superheavy elements using cold fusion, but they had limited success. Then, in the 1970s, a team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, or JINR, in the Soviet Union, decided to switch gears to hot fusion, and they chose calcium-48 as their projectile of choice. So they were the first to successfully create nihonium. Well, it's a bit complicated. In 1998, they may have accidentally created nihonium-290 as a byproduct of another experiment, but the results were debated. It sparked a race between two teams, the JINR, now in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the U.S., and a team at Riken in Japan, each using a different approach. Okay, so we have a transcontinental rivalry brewing. Tell me more about these teams and their methods. The JINR-LNL team, sticking with their hot fusion approach, claimed in 2003 to have created element 115, which then decayed into nihonium. They bombarded americium-243 with those trusty calcium-48 projectiles. Meanwhile, the Riken team, led by Kusuke Marita, took a different route. They used cold fusion with bismuth-209 and zinc-70, hoping for a more easily identifiable decay chain. So, two different approaches, both aiming for the same elusive target. It sounds like a nail-biter. But before we delve into who ultimately won this scientific showdown, I'm curious, how do you actually prove you've created a new element? What are the rules of the game in this atomic competition? That's a great question. In the world of element discovery, it's not enough to just create something new. You need to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt. And that's where the Joint Working Party, or JWP, comes in. The JWP? Sounds serious. They are. The JWP is like the scientific referee. For new element discoveries, they're a collaboration between two international organizations, IUPAC and IUPAP. And they have very strict criteria for validating a claim. It's like presenting your case in a scientific court. So, what kind of evidence do these atomic detectives need to present to the JWP? What's the burden of proof for a brand new element? First, the element must have a different atomic number than any known element. That's the number of protons in its nucleus, which defines what element it is. Then they have to show that its properties, either physical or chemical, are distinct and don't match any previously known element. That makes sense. You can't just say, oh, it looks shiny, so it must be new. But with nihonium decaying so quickly, how do they even have time to measure its properties? That's the real challenge. Most of what we know about nihonium's properties is based on theoretical calculations. But the key to proving its existence lies in its decay chain. The JWP requires something called cross-reactions and anchoring. Think of it like connecting the dots. Okay, I'm intrigued. Walk me through this connect-the-dots process. What are cross-reactions and anchoring, and how do they apply to nihonium? Cross-reactions involve creating the same element using different nuclear reactions. So if both the JINR, LLNL team and the RIKIN team could create nihonium using different methods, it would strengthen the evidence. Anchoring is even more crucial. It means demonstrating that the decay chain of the new element ultimately leads to a known stable isotope. It's like tracing a family tree back to a well-documented ancestor. Ah, so they're not just observing nihonium in isolation, they're watching it transform and making sure it aligns with the known family tree of elements. It's like a radioactive puzzle. Exactly. And in the case of nihonium, both teams faced the challenge of creating enough atoms, observing those fleeting decay chains, and convincing the JWP that their data was solid. So, after all that, who emerged victorious? Did either team manage to satisfy these rigorous criteria and claim the title of nihonium discoverer? It was a long and winding road, with both teams presenting their findings, facing scrutiny from the JWP, and going back to refine their experiments. The JINR-LLNL team focused on bolstering their claim with chemical studies on dubnium, a decay product of element 115, which they said proved their method created nihonium. So, they were trying to solidify their argument by showing that the decay products matched expectations. Clever. But what about the RIKIN team? What was their strategy? The RIKIN team took a slightly different approach. They focused on creating more atoms of nihonium-278, the isotope they produced using cold fusion, and they succeeded in observing a longer decay chain, which ultimately anchored it to mendelivium-254, a known and well-characterized isotope. Ah, so they found that crucial link to a known ancestor in the element family tree. Sounds like a meticulous and incredibly challenging process. But did the JWP finally declare a winner in this scientific marathon? Yes. In December 2015, after years of back and forth, the JWP finally awarded credit for the discovery of nihonium to the RIKIN team, their approach. Coupled with the observation of that longer decay chain, ultimately tipped the scales in their favor. That's quite a victory. So the RIKIN team got to choose the name, right? I'm guessing they went with something that reflected their hard work and dedication. Maybe RIKINIUM to commemorate the institute where the discovery was made. Well, RIKINIUM might have been a fitting tribute to their hard work. They chose a name with a deeper meaning. They named it nihonium, derived from nihon, one of the Japanese words for Japan. Nihonium, it has a nice ring to it. And I imagine it must have been a proud moment for Japan to have an element named after their country. Absolutely. It's a testament to their scientific prowess and a recognition of the years of dedicated effort by the RIKIN team
