## Description

A practical tour of descriptive statisticsâ€”mean vs. median, measures of variability, skewness and kurtosis, and the visuals that reveal data shapes. Weâ€™ll tie historical roots (John Grant and Bills Mortality) to modern practice and walk through a concrete example with heights and weights to show how these tools uncover patterns and guide decisions.

## Transcript

Welcome back everyone. Today we're doing a deep dive into descriptive statistics. You know, like how we can use these essential tools to get a handle on data. Whether we're talking about heights and weights of a bunch of people or maybe tracking stock prices over time. We've got some pretty interesting sources for this one. Wikipedia, statistics by Jim, and even a bit about the history of statistics. Yeah, descriptive statistics really are like the core tools for any data scientist. They let us boil down these complex data sets to just their essential features. Really helps you see the patterns and trends that you might miss in a giant spreadsheet. Right, and our listeners are already pretty familiar with STEM stuff. So let's just cut to the chase. Like when would you choose one measure of central tendency over another? For example, when would the median be better than the mean? Good question. The mean or average is what people usually go to first. But it can be really thrown off by outliers. Let's say you're analyzing income data and you happen to have a couple of billionaires in your sample. Their huge wealth is going to make the mean look way higher than what the typical income really is. So in that case, the median, which is the middle value when everything's sorted, that'd give you a more accurate idea of the average person's income. So if my data is skewed, like with the income example, the median is safer to use? Okay, now what about variability? We have a whole bunch of measures for that. Standard deviation, variance, range, and the interquartile range. How do we pick the right one? Well, it really depends on what you want to highlight. Standard deviation is the classic. It tells you how much the values are spread out from the mean on average. But if you're more interested in how stable the middle 50% of the data is, you know, ignoring the really extreme values, then the interquartile range would be better. That's just the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile. So you're basically looking at the typical spread within the core of the data. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. You're focusing on the signal, not the noise. Kind of like in signal processing where you filter out the outliers. So let's talk about the shape of the distribution. Skewness and kurtosis can seem kind of abstract. Got any real-world examples for how they're used? Sure. Think about analyzing customer purchase data. A right-skewed distribution of purchase amounts, well, that means most customers are spending small amounts, but you've got a few big spenders who are really skewing the data. Understanding that skewness can be really important for making decisions about marketing and how much inventory to keep. So a retailer might want to have special marketing strategies just for those high-value customers who are out there in the long tail of the distribution. Yep, exactly. And kurtosis. Think about the stock market. A high kurtosis in stock returns, that means things are volatile. Lots of extreme price swings, up and down. Investors got to adjust their risk tolerance accordingly. It's really interesting how these measures can be used to understand data in such different areas, you know, from customer behavior to financial markets. Now, in our sources, they mention this guy, John Grant, and his work with London's Bills Mortality. What can we learn from his work back in the 17th century that's still relevant to descriptive statistics today? Oh, John Grant. He was a real pioneer. He used data to try to understand public health. His bills of mortality, basically they were early versions of frequency tables that showed how many people died from different things every week. He was able to find patterns and trends that nobody had noticed before. Things like how some diseases were more common at certain times of the year. His work really set the stage for epidemiology as we know it today, which depends heavily on descriptive stats for things like tracking outbreaks, identifying risks, and figuring out how well public health measures are working. It's amazing how he could get so much insight from such basic data. Really shows how powerful these fundamental statistical ideas are. Right. The tools and techniques have definitely gotten more advanced, but the core principles of descriptive statistics are still the same. To summarize, visualize, and really just understand the patterns in data. We've talked about all these different measures and their applications, but I think it would be helpful to see how this works with an actual example. Remember that data on the heights and weights of 88 teenage girls? How could we use descriptive statistics to quickly get a sense of the key features of that data set? Well, first we got to figure out what we want to know. Do we want to find out the typical height and weight of the girls in this sample? Or maybe how much variation there is in those measurements? Or maybe we want to see if there's a relationship between height and weight. Descriptive stats can help us with all of that. Okay, let's say we want to understand the typical height and weight. We could just calculate the mean, but we talked about this earlier, right? The median might be better if the data is skewed. Exactly. Calculating both the mean and the median, that's a good place to start. If they're pretty close, it means the distribution is probably symmetrical. But if there's a big difference, then it might be skewed. Which could be interesting, you know? Like if the mean height is a lot higher than the median height, maybe there are a few really tall girls in the sample. Right, it's not just about the numbers themselves. It's about figuring out what they mean. Okay, so how would we look at the spread or variability in heights and weights? Well, we've got a few options. We could look at the range, which tells us the difference between the tallest and shortest and the heaviest and lightest girl. But the range can be thrown off by outliers, right? So we might also want to calculate the standard deviation. That tells us how much the values typically deviate from the mean height and weight. And if we're more interested in the spread of the middle 50% of the data, we could use the interquartile range, right? That would help us see the typical variability but without those outliers. Exactly. Imagine we find that the interquartile range for height is pretty small, but for weight it's much larger. That might mean that the girls in this sample are all pretty similar in height, but their weights vary a lot more. It's like we're starting to see the data take shape, you know? Okay, now how can we visualize the distribution of heights and weights, like to get a more intuitive sense of the patterns? Histograms would be perfect for that. We could do one for heights and one for weights. That way we can quickly see the shape of each distribution. Is it symmetrical, skewed, maybe even bimodal, which means there are two distinct groups within the data. So if the histogram for heights looks like a bell curve, that means the heights are normally distributed, with most girls clustered around the average. But what if the histogram for weights is skewed to the right? What would that tell us? A right skew for weight. That probably means most girls are in a certain weight range, but then there are a few girls with much higher weights pulling that tail of the distribution to the right. Could be all sorts of reasons for that. Differences in body composition, genetics, maybe even lifestyle choices. It makes sense. And you wouldn't be able to see that just from the mean or median. The histogram gives you a much better picture. So far we've just been looking at heights and weights separately, but what if we want to see if there's a relationship between the two? That's where a scatter plot comes in handy. You plot each girl's height on one axis and weight on the other, and then you can see if there's a visual pattern. If the points on the scatter plot look like they're forming a line that slopes upward, well, that means there's a positive correlation. Taller girls tend to weigh more. And we can actually measure how strong that relationship is and what direction it goes in using the correlation coefficient. Like if it's close to one, it's a strong positive correlation. And if it's close to zero, there's no relationship at all. Exactly. And even if there is a correlation, it's really important to remember that correlation doesn't automatically mean causation. There could be other things going on that affect both height and weight. Things like genetics, nutrition, how active they are, all that stuff. That's a good point. Descriptive statistics can help us see patterns and relationships, but they don't tell us why those patterns exist. We'd need to do more digging to figure that out. I'm curious, could we use these same descriptive techniques for other aspects of this data? Like what if we also had information about the girls' ages, their BMI, or their dietary habits? Oh yeah, definitely. We could analyze those variables one at a time using the same measures we've been talking about. Like we could calculate the average age or maybe look at the standard deviation of BMI. We could even make a histogram to see how the different dietary preferences are distributed. And we could see if there are any connections between those variables too, right? Right. Like maybe a scatter plot of age versus height would show a positive correlation. Makes sense, right? Taller girls are probably older, at least within this teenage group. Or we could use a box plot to compare the BMIs of girls who say they're more or less active. It's pretty cool how we can use these tools to look at the data from so many different angles, you know, find those hidden patterns and relationships. And like you said before, descriptive statistics are often just the first step. They can help us come up with hypotheses and see where we need to do more research. Exactly. Like let's say we see a strong correlation between BMI and certain eating habits. Well,
