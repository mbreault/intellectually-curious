## Description

In this Deep Dive episode, we unpack Meta's Llama 4 lineupâ€”Scout, Maverick, and the Behemoth teacher. We break down the innovations: native multimodality, expansive context windows, mixture-of-experts architectures, and interleaved attention (IROP) for long sequences. We discuss what this means for developersâ€”reasoning over large codebases, building personalized user experiences with image grounding, and comparing Scout and Maverick with other models. Plus, what 'infinite context' could unlock in the future.

## Transcript

All right, welcome back to the Deep Dive. Today we're going to be talking about something really exciting that's happening in computer science and software engineering. It's about this new announcement from Meta about these new models that they're calling Llama 4. And I think this is a pretty big deal, especially if you're involved in building software and kind of thinking about what the future looks like. This stuff really makes you think about what's possible. Oh yeah, absolutely. We see these announcements kind of come and go, but I think what's really unique about this is the multimodality of it. That really does open up a lot more personalized, intuitive kinds of experiences for users. So yeah, it's definitely a new era for the Llama ecosystem, I think. That's a good way to put it, yeah. A new era. So we're going to be focusing on two of the main models that were unveiled, Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick. We also got a sneak peek at their really powerful teacher model, which is Llama 4 Behemoth. But I think the goal for us today is to kind of cut through some of the technical jargon and really understand what are the innovations here? What makes these models different from what's already out there? Yeah, that's a great question. I think starting with the Llama 4 Herd, as Meta's calling it, these are the first models in this new generation. And again, they're really focused on building these more personalized, multimodal experiences, right? So Llama 4 Scout and Maverick, they're open weight and natively multimodal from the ground up. And they've got this unprecedented context length and an interesting architecture using this mixture of experts. Yeah, okay. Mixture of experts. Interesting. We're going to have to dive into that a little bit more, I think. And then you mentioned Llama 4 Behemoth. And it's like this preview, this kind of like super powerful model. What is it exactly? Like, how does it fit into all of this? Yeah. So think of Behemoth as like the apex model. It's their most powerful large language model, but it's primarily being used as a teacher model initially to improve the quality of the other models. Oh, okay. So it's kind of like helping train the other models to be even better. Exactly. Okay, got it. So let's start with Llama 4 Scout. What are the key specs we should know about? Yeah, so Scout's operating with 17 billion active parameters. It's got 16 experts. Meta's calling it the best multimodal model in the world in its class. It's more powerful than the previous Llama generations, and it fits on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU with N4 quantization. Wow, that's pretty amazing. And you mentioned quantization. Like, what exactly is that and why is it important? Yeah, so N4 quantization is a technique that allows you to kind of compress the model. It reduces the memory footprint, and it makes it more efficient to run without sacrificing too much performance. Okay, so it's kind of like making the model more streamlined so it can run on less powerful hardware? Exactly, yeah. Cool. And then the context window, it's like 10 million tokens. What does that even mean? Yeah, 10 million tokens is huge. It's an industry-leading context window. And what that means is that the model can consider a much larger amount of information when it's processing something. So you could feed it like an entire code base or a huge collection of research papers, and it would be able to understand the relationships between all of that information. Okay, so it's like having a much bigger working memory. It can hold more stuff in its mind at once. Exactly. Yeah, that's a great analogy. So what kinds of things could you do with a context window that big? I mean, it's hard to even imagine. Well, you could do things like multi-document summarization. So if you had a bunch of different documents, you could feed them all to the model, and it could summarize all of them in a way that understands how they relate to each other. That's pretty incredible. Yeah. Or you could analyze user activity over a long period of time. So if you were trying to build a really personalized experience for a user, you could feed it their entire history of interactions, and it could figure out what they're really interested in. Wow. And I guess for software engineers, you were saying you could even feed it an entire code base. Like, what would that even be useful for? Yeah. I mean, imagine being able to reason over a massive code base, you know, find bugs, identify security vulnerabilities, even suggest improvements. The possibilities are really exciting. Yeah. That's pretty wild. So how does Scout actually perform compared to other models out there? So Meta's internal evaluations show that it's actually doing better than models like Gemini 3, Gemini 2.0 Flashlight, and Mistral 3.1 across a bunch of different benchmarks. So it seems to be really strong in its class. That's pretty impressive. So they're claiming that it's, like, the best in its class. That's what their data suggests, yeah. Okay, interesting. And you mentioned that it was trained with this, like, really long context length. Why is that so important? Yeah, so both the pre-training and the post-training were done with a 256,000 token context length. And that allows the model to develop a really good length generalization. So it can handle these really long sequences of information, even if they're longer than what it was originally trained on. Okay, so it can adapt to even longer stuff. Exactly. That makes sense. And then there's this IROP architecture. What's the deal with that? Yeah, so IROP stands for interleaved attention layers without positional embeddings. And it's this new approach to handling positional information in these really long sequences. Because traditional methods, they kind of struggle with that. So IROP combined with inference time temperature scaling, it helps the model understand where different pieces of information fit within a really long stream of data. And it improves the length generalization even further. Okay, so it's like giving the model a better sense of order within this massive amount of information. Exactly. And their goal is to kind of move towards what they're calling infinite context. Infinite context? What does that even mean? Well, it's this theoretical idea that you could process any length of sequence no matter how long it is. So it's like there's no limit to how much information it could handle. That's the idea. It's a pretty ambitious goal. Yeah, it sounds like it. And what about understanding images? Like you mentioned Scout is multimodal. So how does it do with visuals? Yeah, so Scout has what they're calling best in class image grounding. And what that means is that it can align parts of the user's prompt with specific visual concepts in an image. And it can actually anchor its response to those regions in the image. So it's not just recognizing objects. It's like understanding their relationships to each other and to the user's question. Exactly. Yeah, it's a much deeper level of understanding. Wow. So it sounds like Scout is like this really efficient, capable model. Yeah. Especially good at these really long sequences and understanding images. So let's move on to Llama 4 Maverick. It's also got 17 billion active parameters, but the total parameter count is way bigger. Like what's the difference there? Yeah. So Maverick has 17 billion active parameters, same as Scout, but the total parameter count is 400 billion. And that's because it has 128 experts in its mixture of experts architecture. Okay, so it's got a lot more experts. Like what does that do for its performance? Well, Meta is saying it's also the best multimodal model in its class. And it's actually beating models like GPT-4O and Gemini 2.0 Flash across benchmarks. And it's getting comparable results to DeepSeek V3 on reasoning and coding, but with fewer active parameters. Wow. So even though it has fewer active parameters, it's still performing just as well or even better than these other really advanced models. Yeah. And that really speaks to the power of the mixture of experts architecture. Okay. So can you explain a little bit more about how this mixture of experts thing actually works? Sure. So the idea is that you have all these different expert networks within the model, and each expert specializes in a different type of task or a different type of data. So when the model gets an input, it can route that input to the expert that's best suited to handle it. Oh, okay. So it's kind of like having a team of specialists, each one with their own area of expertise. Exactly. And that makes the model much more efficient because you're only using the compute power that you need for that specific task. That makes a lot of sense. And you were mentioning earlier that Maverick also has a really good performance to cost ratio. Yeah. They have this experimental chat version of Maverick that got an ELO score of 1417 on Elmerina. Okay. And ELO, that's like a ranking system. Right. It's like a measure of how well a model performs in a conversational setting. Okay. So that's a pretty high score. Yeah. It's really good, especially when you consider how efficiently the model is running. So this mixture of experts thing seems to be really important for both efficiency and quality. Absolutely. And it's a key part of how Maverick is able to achieve such impressive results. Okay. Got it. And like Scout, Maverick is also natively multimodal. Yes. It uses what's called early fusion. So the text and the visual tokens, they're integrated into the model's processing from the very beginning. So it's really good at understanding how those two modalities relate to each other. And they mentioned some improvements to the vision encoder. How does that work? Yeah. So
