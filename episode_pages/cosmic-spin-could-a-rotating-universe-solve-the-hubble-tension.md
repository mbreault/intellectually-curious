## Description

In this Science Corner episode on the Deep Dive, we explore a bold idea: might the universe itself be rotating? We examine the Hubble tensionâ€”the mismatch between early- and late-universe measures of the expansion rateâ€”and how a small global rotation, or related ideas like a self-similar dark fluid, could alter cosmic history. We trace concepts from GÃ¶del to the possibility of our universe inside a Kerr black hole, and discuss what such models would need to match CMB observations, large-scale structure, and nucleosynthesis before we can seriously embrace them.

## Transcript

Welcome back to the Science Corner, our special series here on the Deep Dive. We like to tackle some of the big questions, the really intriguing scientific puzzles. Absolutely. It's where the exciting frontiers often are. And today, we've got a real cosmic head-scratcher for you. Could the universe itself actually be rotating? It sounds wild, I know. But it's an idea being seriously considered, partly because it might, just might, help solve another major puzzle, the Hubble tension. Right, the Hubble puzzle. We'll definitely get into that. So today, we're looking at some pretty cutting-edge research ideas that are really pushing against our standard view of the cosmos. Exactly. We'll be digging into that standard model, LCDM, and why it's starting to show some cracks, especially around the universe's expansion rate. Okay, so let's start there. The standard cosmological model, LCDM, it's been the bedrock for, what, 30 years now? Pretty much, yes. It's been remarkably successful explaining a huge range of observations, from the large-scale structure of galaxies to the afterglow of the Big Bang. And it's built on Einstein's general relativity, assuming the universe is, broadly speaking, the same everywhere and in every direction, right? Homogeneous and isotropic. That's the core assumption for the large scales, yes. It gives us this mathematical framework, the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, or FLRW metric, to describe the overall expansion. Think of it like describing the surface of an expanding balloon, ignoring the little wrinkles. The overall shape and stretch is uniform. Makes sense. But you mentioned cracks. Even with all its successes, CDM isn't perfect, is it? No, not quite. There are some deep theoretical issues, like why dark energy has the value it does the fine-tuning problem, and, of course, the big elephant in the room. We don't actually know what dark matter or dark energy are. Right, the stuff that supposedly makes up 95% of the universe. Precisely. And beyond those sort of foundational mysteries, we're now seeing actual observational tensions cropping up. The biggest one being this Hubble tension. Okay, let's dive into that. The Hubble tension. What is it exactly? It's a significant disagreement, statistically speaking, about five standard deviations, which is huge, between two main ways we measure the Hubble constant, H naught, the current expansion rate of the universe. Two different methods giving two different answers for how fast the universe is expanding right now. Exactly. When we look at the very early universe, using data from the cosmic microwave background, the CMB, specifically from the Planck satellite, we infer an expansion rate of about 67.4 kilometers per second per megaparsec. Okay, 67.4. That's based on the universe's baby picture, essentially. You could say that, yes. It relies on using the LCDM model to extrapolate forward from that early time. But when we measure the expansion rate more directly in the local universe, using things like Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae as cosmic distance markers. Like a cosmic measuring tape, sort of? Sort of, yes. When we do that, using projects like SH0ES, led by Adam Rees, we get a higher value, significantly higher, around 73.10 kilometers per second per megaparsec. 73 versus 67.4. That doesn't sound like just a small measurement error. It really doesn't seem to be. Scientists have spent years scrutinizing both the Planck data and the local measurements, like those from the Hubble Space Telescope, looking for systematic errors. And while you can never be 100% certain, the consensus is growing that errors alone are unlikely to explain the whole discrepancy. So if it's not just a mistake in the measurements, we're left with what? A universe that expanded differently in the past than we thought? Or maybe the expansion rate isn't the same everywhere? Both are possibilities people are exploring. It highlights that the CMB value is model-dependent. It assumes ADM is correct for the entire expansion history. The supernova value is more direct, a snapshot of the recent universe. Are there other ways to measure H0 to try and break the tie? Oh, yes. There's a lot of effort going into independent methods. Things like gravitational lensing, where you measure time delays of light from quasars bending around massive galaxies. Also studying megamasers, incredibly bright water masers in other galaxies, and even gravitational waves from merging neutron stars. Fast radio bursts, too. A whole arsenal of cosmic tools. And what are they finding? Are they siding with Planck or the supernovae? Well, the results are still a bit mixed, honestly. Some methods seem to lean closer to the supernova value. Others are maybe in between or have large uncertainties. Interestingly, some studies using quasar lensing, like the H-L-I-L-E-S-S-A-C-A-U collaboration, hinted that H0 might actually decrease slightly as you look further back at higher redshift lenses. So the expansion rate might not be constant now. It could be changing even in the recent cosmic past. That's one interpretation, yes. The statistical significance in that lensing study wasn't super high, maybe 1.7 sigma. But other analyses using large supernova samples like Pantheon plus Calamay have also found hints of similar trends, maybe suggesting late-time modifications to HCDM could ease the tension. Though, again, not all studies agree. It's still very much an active area of research and debate. Okay, so the tension is real, the cause is uncertain, which opens the door to maybe more exotic ideas, like this rotating universe concept. Exactly. When your standard model is under pressure, you start to explore alternatives you might have previously dismissed. And the idea of a rotating universe, while non-standard, isn't entirely new. Didn't you mention GÃ¶del earlier? Yes, Kurt GÃ¶del, back in 1947. He found an exact solution to Einstein's field equations that described a universe filled with rotating matter. It was mathematically valid within general relativity. And it allowed for time travel. That sounds pretty wild. It did, mathematically at least. His model had these things called closed timelike curves. But let's be clear, our universe almost certainly isn't that kind of rotating universe. Why not? What tells us we're not living in a GÃ¶del universe? Well, for one, his model didn't expand, and we definitely see the universe expanding. Also, the kind of rotation in his model would create very specific large-scale effects, anisotropies, that we just don't observe, especially in the CMB. Planck data puts really tight limits on those kinds of effects. So GÃ¶del's specific model is out, but does that rule out any kind of rotation? Not necessarily. It rules out that specific metric, and likely any very strong obvious rotation. But could there be a much more subtle global rotation? One that doesn't violate the CMB constraints? That's still theoretically on the table. Generalizations of GÃ¶del's idea or other models incorporating rotation haven't been completely ruled out. Okay, a subtle spin. How would that even help with the Hubble tension? How do you model that? That's the tricky part. One approach involves treating dark matter and dark energy not as separate things, but as two sides of the same coin, a single dark fluid. Then researchers use a specific mathematical technique, a kind of self-similar approach based on work by Sadov and Taylor, to model how this fluid would behave if the universe had some overall rotation. A self-similar dark fluid. Okay. So you model the spinning fluid and see how the expansion rate changes over time. Essentially, yes. They look at how the fluid's density, velocity, and gravity evolve. They often start by assuming it's still roughly spherical, even with rotation, to simplify the math. And importantly, if you turn the rotation off in these models... It should match the standard CDM model, right? Exactly. And it does. That's a crucial check. But when they dial in some rotation, they find something interesting. What happens? The results suggest that the initial amount of rotation affects the expansion history. You could start with an expansion rate consistent with a CMB in the early universe, add a specific small amount of rotation, and end up with a Hubble constant today that matches the higher local measurements from supernovae. Wow. So the rotation itself changes how the expansion evolves over billions of years. According to these models, yes. They estimate that a very tiny angular speed today, something like less than 0.002 per billion years, might be enough to bridge the gap? This would correspond to a much faster, though still subtle, rotation way back when the CMB formed. That's quite something. A tiny spin solving the big tension. But I guess the catch is whether this rotating model fits everything else. That's the huge caveat, absolutely. This particular line of research focused primarily on H naught. A full rotating universe model would need to be consistent with the details of the CMB power spectrum, large-scale structure formation, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the whole suite of cosmological observations that CDM explains so well. Plus, these models are often simplified. Developing a full, general relativistic treatment is still needed. So, promising, perhaps, but still a lot of work to do. You mentioned an even more out-there idea. Our universe inside a black hole. A rotating one. Right. This is definitely more speculative, pushing the boundaries even further. The hypothesis is that our entire observable universe might actually exist inside a huge rotating black hole, a Kerr black hole, which itself exists in a higher dimensional space or bulk. Okay, wait. Our universe inside a black hole? How does that even work? What about the Big Bang? In this picture, the Big Bang isn't the absolute beginning. It might be interpreted as
