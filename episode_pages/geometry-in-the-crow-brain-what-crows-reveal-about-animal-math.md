New research shows crows can recognize geometric regularity, not just memorize pictures. In this episode of Science Corner, we break down the touchscreen experiments, explore how abstract geometry might arise in non-mammalian minds, and discuss the broader implications for the evolution of intelligence and our understanding of brain architectures across species.

## Transcript

Welcome back to the Science Corner podcast. This is where we take a deep dive into some really interesting science topics for, well, anyone curious, really. Glad to be here. Today we're tackling something I found fascinating. Math and crows. It sounds a bit strange, maybe. Well, it certainly challenges some common ideas about animal intelligence. Right. So our mission, if you will, is to explore these new findings about the mathematical abilities crows seem to possess. You might actually be surprised. I think many will be. We're drawing on some recent scientific papers and news reports. Okay, so let's start with the background. There's been this long-held belief, hasn't there, that certain thinking skills, like understanding geometry, are uniquely human. Absolutely. For a very long time, that was the dominant view in cognitive science. We humans seem naturally good at spotting geometric patterns, regularity. And the assumption was, well, other animals just don't operate on that level. Exactly. But that's where this new research comes in and really shakes things up. Yeah, I saw a quote from Professor Nieder, who's leading some of this work. He basically said the idea that only humans get geometric regularity is now, quote, falsified. Strong words, but his team's experiments with crows provide some compelling evidence to back that up. So before Nieder, we knew humans were good at this. But the idea that other animals might have some innate geometric sense. It wasn't really the focus. Research often looked at other things, memory, tool use, social learning, things maybe more obviously tied to survival. So this geometric angle is relatively new territory for animal studies. In this specific way, yes. Nieder's team really zeroed in on it, asking, can crows perceive geometric regularity itself? Okay, so how did they test that? Let's get into the experiment itself. Right. So they used a controlled setup, touchscreens, basically. First, they had to teach the crows the basic game. The game being? Find the odd one out. They'd show the crow, say, five images of a moon and one image of a flower. Oh, okay. And the crow pecks the flower. Exactly. Peck the different one, get a reward, a tasty mealworm usually. Standard operant conditioning to teach the rule. Got it. So establish the rule first, then comes the real test. Precisely. Once the crows understood, find the different one, the researchers changed the images. They started using sets of four-sided shapes. Quadrilaterals. Yep. And here's the clever part. In each set, there would be five identical regular shapes, perfect squares, and one irregular shape, a quadrilateral, but, you know, with wonky sides and angles. Okay, squares versus a non-square quadrilateral. But the key thing I read was that this irregular shape wasn't wildly different visually, right? That's crucial. It was designed to look perceptually quite similar to the squares. Same general size, same color, probably. So the crow couldn't just rely on spotting, like, a bright red shape among blue ones? No. The difference wasn't superficial. The difference was the geometry. Regular versus irregular. It forced them to pay attention to the underlying structure, the pattern of sides and angles. Did they pick out the irregular one? They could. Consistently. They successfully identified the geometrically irregular shape as the odd one out, even when it looked superficially similar to the regular squares. Wow. Okay, so that really suggests they're not just matching pictures. They're grasping the concept of regularity. That's the interpretation, yes. It points towards an ability to distinguish based on the abstract property of geometric regularity itself, something we really thought was, well, mostly a human thing. And how did other researchers react? Sometimes these findings get debated pretty heavily. Well, the sources we looked at suggest the reaction was quite positive. One scientist not involved in the study called the evidence quite convincing. It's good to hear. Yeah, and they also said it was pretty cool, which, you know, in scientific circles... It was basically jumping up and down yelling, eureka. Huh, something like that. But that same researcher raised the big question, where does that even come from? Right, because there wasn't much previous work looking for this specific ability in animals. Exactly. It kind of came out of left field for many. So what are the theories? Where does it come from? Does Nieder have ideas? He does. He suspects that our own human geometric sense might not be some completely separate invention. It might be built upon more basic, perhaps more widespread abilities found in other animals. So like an evolutionary precursor, a foundation that we share, maybe? That seems to be his thinking, that perhaps a sensitivity to basic geometric forms provides some kind of advantage, maybe in navigation or recognizing objects or even building nests, perhaps, and that this basic sense is more common than we realized. And he hopes others will now look for this in other animals too. Yes, definitely. See if this pops up in dolphins or primates or other intelligent birds. It could really reshape our understanding of how mathematical thinking evolved. It's interesting to think about the broader context of animal intelligence studies, isn't it? How far we've come. Oh, absolutely. You know, early on it was very anecdotal, stories about clever pets. Right. Then people like Thorndike and Pavlov brought it into the lab, focused on observable behavior, learning through association. That was a huge step toward scientific rigor, moving away from just stories. But still quite focused on behavior, not necessarily inner thoughts. Right. Then, around the 1960s, you get the cognitive revolution. It became more acceptable for scientists to infer mental processes, thinking, planning, problem-solving from animal behavior. Acknowledging that there's something going on inside their heads. Exactly. Viewing animals as information processors. And this crow research fits right into that modern framework. It's not just about the pecking, it's about what the pecking tells us about their understanding of an abstract concept like geometry. And crows specifically have really emerged as stars in animal cognition, haven't they? They really have. The list of their abilities is quite impressive. Recognizing human faces, for instance, holding grudges even. I read about that. And tool use, of course. The famous New Caledonian crow, Betty. Betty, who spontaneously bent a piece of wire into a hook to get food out of a tube. That was groundbreaking. Shows real problem-solving, not just instinct. And then there's play behavior, maybe even those crow funerals. Though the interpretation there is still debated. True. The funeral idea is more speculative, but they definitely show complex social interactions. The Science Friday piece we saw compared their overall intelligence to that of a seven-year-old human child. That's quite a comparison. And we've even trained them to do complex tasks, right? Like that project with the crowbar vending machine. Yes, teaching them to collect cigarette butts for a reward. Or the rooks at that historical park in France, Coup de Fou, trained to pick up litter. It shows their learning capacity when motivated. So, taking all this intelligence, the tool use, the social stuff, now this geometric sense, where does it leave us in terms of evolution? How do bird brains achieve this? That's another fascinating angle. The Smithsonian article touched on this. Bird brains are structured very differently from mammal brains. We have this large cerebral cortex. Which we usually associate with higher intelligence. Right. Birds don't have that same structure. Yet species like crows achieve comparable cognitive feats. It suggests that the cortex isn't the only route to complex intelligence. So, different hardware can run similar software, essentially. In a manner of speaking, yes. It implies that advanced cognition can evolve through different anatomical pathways. And that Smithsonian piece linked this back to dinosaurs. It did. Some dinosaur ancestors, particularly things like troodontids, had relatively large brains for their body size. The article speculated that if their brain organization was more bird-like than traditionally assumed reptile-like, well, they might have been smarter than we often pictured them. That's a mind-bender. Could dinosaurs have been quite intelligent? It opens the possibility. And it has huge implications for how we think about intelligence itself. If a cortex isn't strictly necessary. Then what about consciousness? Could that also arise in different brain structures? That's the profound question the article raises. Either consciousness has incredibly ancient evolutionary roots, going back before mammals and birds split. Or it evolved independently. Multiple times. Exactly. Once in the lineage leading to mammals, and again in the lineage leading to birds. Both possibilities are pretty staggering. And they even took it one step further, speculating about life elsewhere. Yeah, if intelligence isn't tied to one specific brain plan, like the mammalian one, then intelligent aliens, if they exist, might not be humanoid at all. They might be more bird-like, based on this alternative successful model for high intelligence. It's a plausible speculation based on this line of thinking. It forces us to broaden our definition of what intelligent life might look like. Okay, so let's try to wrap this up for our listeners. What's the big takeaway from this dive into crow mathematics? I think the main point is that these birds have shown a truly surprising ability to recognize geometric regularity. It fundamentally challenges our old assumptions about which minds can handle abstract concepts. It tells us intelligence isn't just a human monopoly, and maybe not even a mammal monopoly for certain types of thinking. Precisely. It suggests the roots of mathematical abilities might go deeper, be more widespread than we ever thought. And it highlights how much we still have to learn about animal minds. The research really pushes boundaries, doesn't it? Showing intelligence can take diverse forms. Absolutely. And it leaves us with a really provocative thought, doesn't it? Which is? Well, if crows can grasp geometry, what other
