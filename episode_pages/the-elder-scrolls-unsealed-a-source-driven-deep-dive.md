## Transcript

Hey everyone, and welcome back. I'm so glad you could join us again. Today we're diving into one of the most requested topics we've had. And honestly, I'm a little awestruck we haven't tackled it yet. The Elder Scrolls themselves. A daunting but thrilling subject to be sure. A bit like trying to map the constellations while standing on shifting sands. That's a great way to put it. And luckily we have a ton of amazing excerpts from you listeners out there and some really thorough entries from the fandom wiki to guide our deep dive. A treasure trove to be sure. Though I have a feeling we'll end up with more questions than answers by the end of this. The mysteries of the scrolls run deep. Oh, absolutely. But that's part of the fun, right? But before we go full Hermes more on this, let's set some ground rules, shall we? We're sticking to what we have, the scrolls, the wiki, all that good stuff you sent in. No wild theories. No, what if the Nerevarine was actually a crab? Tangents. Unless, well, unless the wiki says so. A wise precaution, though I have a feeling those crab-like tangents might be hard to resist. But I'll try my best to stick with the source material. I appreciate that. Okay, so the Elder Scrolls. Where do we even begin? They're these artifacts shrouded in mystery. Nobody really knows their origins. And get this, they hold records of the past, the present, and the future all at once. Seriously, try wrapping your head around that concept. Paradoxical, aren't they? They're like a history book that updates with every passing second. A chronicle of what was, is, and could be existing all at the same time. And this intricate dance between the scrolls and time, well, that's what makes them so captivating to study. So they don't just tell time, they practically breathe it. It's true. And understanding that is, well, it's key to even beginning to grasp their nature. The wiki mentioned something about fixed points and possible events. So before something happens, the scrolls show different potential outcomes, like a choose-your-own-adventure novel written across the cosmos. Precisely. Imagine, if you will, a fork in the road. Before a choice is made, all paths exist as possibilities within the scrolls. But once an event occurs, one path solidifies into the fixed and unchanging text of the past. So like, the moment Lorkhan's heart was pierced, before it happened, it was just a potential outcome on the scrolls. But after, bam, fixed point in history. Exactly. And that's what leads to this misconception that the scrolls dictate destiny. They don't. They're a reflection of choice, consequence, a cosmic kaleidoscope of what might be. It's less about a predetermined fate, more like observing a river. Its currents are constantly changing, branching, merging. The scrolls capture that flow. Okay, I think I'm starting to get it. Sort of. So we've got these crazy powerful artifact that can give you a sneak peek into the past, the present, and the future. You'd think everyone and their pet skeever would be lining up to get a peek at these things. But the wiki also mentions, well, let's just say there are some occupational hazards. There's a reason why only a select few even attempt to read the Elder Scrolls. And it's not just because they're written in some ancient, undecipherable language, although that's certainly part of it. Yeah, about that. Blindness. Madness. Rumor has it that even attempting to comprehend the sheer scope of knowledge within a scroll can shatter your mind. Is there any truth to that? It's not an exaggeration. It's like trying to download centuries of raw data directly into your brain. The system would overload. The human mind, while remarkable, it's just not equipped to process that kind of cosmic information overload. So it's like staring directly at the sun. Way too potent, too vast. And the consequences, well, they can be pretty severe. Makes that inscription above the library in Skyrim make a lot more sense now. The first words of the first scroll are silence. Silence indeed. Because you're either struck blind or driven utterly mad. Though there are those who dedicate their lives to these texts and seem to fare a bit better. The Cult of the Ancestor Moth. Right, the Moth Priests. Okay, that's where it gets really interesting to me. Because they actually go blind reading these things, from what I understand, which is some serious dedication to knowledge, right? And the wiki mentions something about a ritual and moths. Ah, yes. The Ritual of the Ancestor Moth. It's a fascinating, if somewhat eerie, process. Picture a secluded glade bathed in moonlight. A Moth Priest sits before an Elder Scroll, and as they begin their ritualistic reading, moths, drawn to the scroll's magic, flock to the glade. And these aren't just any moth you'd find fluttering around a lamppost. These moths are drawn to the scroll's ancient knowledge. Their soft buzzing, it grows into this symphony of almost mystical energy, a conduit that allows the Moth Priest to decipher the scroll's secrets without, well, without suffering the full brunt of their power. Okay, I'll admit that's both beautiful and a little bit creepy. Talk about a symbiotic relationship. They get knowledge, the moths get... Well, I'm not sure what the moths get out of it, but it clearly works for them. But the wiki also mentions something about the Dwemer, you know, those master engineers and tech wizards of Elder Scrolls lore? Yeah. Didn't they find a way to avoid the whole blindness thing altogether? Ah, yes, the Dwemer. With their unique understanding of tonal architecture, their thirst for knowledge, they created the lexicon, a technological marvel designed to, you could say, safely access the scroll's wisdom. Imagine a device capable of translating the raw, chaotic energy of the scrolls into a format comprehensible to the mortal mind. No blindness, no madness. Sign me up. I wonder if any of those lexicons are still lying around. Okay, probably not, considering the Dwemer themselves seem to have vanished. Poof. Gone. Along with their amazing tech. Speaking of which, the wiki doesn't really go into detail about what happened to the Dwemer, does it? Their disappearance is one of the biggest mysteries in Elder Scrolls lore. Some believe they tampered with forces beyond their understanding and paid the ultimate price. Others speculate they simply transitioned to a different plane of existence. Perhaps they even found a way to exist outside of time itself, much like the scrolls they studied. Whoa. It's like they were trying to become the very thing they were studying. Okay, now that's a deep dive for another day. But for now, let's shift our focus back to the scrolls themselves. It's clear they're incredibly powerful, profoundly mysterious, and have played a role in some of the most important events in Tamriel's history. I mean, we're talking universe-altering events here. Their influence, it echoes through every era. Take, for example, the Merithic Era, a time of myth and legend. The story of the Tyranny of the Sun, now that showcases the very real consequences of attempting to manipulate the scroll's power. Oh man, the Snow Elves. Talk about holding a grudge. Yeah. But you're right. That whole event highlights how messing with time, even with good intentions, can have some serious ripple effects. The Time Wound, a scar on reality itself. It's a stark reminder of the potential dangers of meddling with forces beyond our comprehension. It really makes you think a single act fueled by desperation and a prophecy gleaned from an Elder Scroll could create a wound in time so profound it continues to bleed into the present era. And speaking of the present era, let's not forget why you, dear listener, brought us these fascinating wiki excerpts in the first place. The Dragonborn, your very own in-game avatar, used an Elder Scroll to defeat Alduin, the World Eater. Talk about your time-traveling paradoxes. Indeed. By consulting an Elder Scroll, the Dragonborn discovered the means to send Alduin forward in time, essentially undoing the very event that threatened to consume the world. It's a powerful example of how the scrolls can be used to not just observe time, but to manipulate it, to bend it to one's will. It really makes you wonder, was the Dragonborn always meant to find that scroll? Were their actions simply another thread in the grand tapestry of time, woven by the scrolls themselves? But the influence of these mysterious artifacts isn't limited to just the first and fourth eras, right? I bet the second and third eras had their fair share of Elder Scrolls shenanigans, too. Absolutely. During the tumultuous Second Era, amidst the chaos of the Three Banners War, each faction craved the power of the Elder Scrolls. It's even said that Emperor Varen Eklaris himself consulted the scrolls, seeking guidance, and perhaps a glimpse into a more stable future. Let me guess. It cost him his sight. Seems like a recurring theme with these things. You'd think emperors would have learned by then, wouldn't you? But alas, the allure of forbidden knowledge, especially the kind that could potentially alter the fate of empires, it proved too tempting to resist. And let's not forget the Third Era. The wiki mentions something about the Hero of Kvatch, who, you know, would later become the legendary Grey Fox, stealing an Elder Scroll. Talk about daring heists. Indeed. And this event highlights another fascinating aspect of the scrolls. They're not just objects of prophecy and wisdom. They are also objects of power, coveted by kings and criminals alike.
