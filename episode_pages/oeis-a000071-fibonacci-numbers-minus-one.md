All right, welcome back. You know what we're doing here, right? Another deep dive into the OEIS. This time it's A000071. New folks. Well, the OEIS is like the ultimate integer sequence collection. You got your Fibonacci's, primes, all that jazz. But the fun part is all the connections. Each sequence is like this doorway to different areas of math. Yeah, and even real world stuff sometimes. It's crazy. So A000071, right? Looks simple at first, like, oh, it's just Fibonacci, but subtract one from each number. Right. See the pattern? Add the last two to get the next one. But not quite. There's a twist. Each term is one less than the Fibonacci number at that spot. So instead of starting with 0, 1, 1, you get 0, 0, 1, and then it goes 2, 4, 7. Oh, I see. So that little change, like, messes up the whole thing. Exactly. Even the way you describe it formally, the recurrence relation, it gets trickier. You don't just add the last two terms, you add one more too. Hold up. More formulas. I'm intrigued already. Yeah, there's this cool one that shows how it's still connected to Fibonacci. You take twice the previous term and subtract the one three steps back. It's like an echo of that add the last two thing, but with a minus thrown in. And then the closed form expressions get really interesting. Ooh, fancy math terms. What's a closed form expression again? For us non-geniuses, you know. It's like a shortcut formula. Instead of calculating each term step by step, you can jump right to any term you want. And in this case, you need something called the golden ratio. Okay, golden ratio. Cool. But like, how W is it in this sequence? Give me an example. One way is it's like the growth factor between terms. You multiply by this golden ratio about 1.618, then round up to the nearest whole number, and bam, next term. So it's baked right into the sequence itself. That's wild. And there are even more closed form expressions with this golden ratio, and it's like mathematical cousin. More complex, but it just shows how deeply linked this A000071 is to Fibonacci, which is also all about that golden ratio. It's like they're dancing around this special number. My brain's starting to hurt, but in a good way. And here's what blows my mind even more. This isn't just theoretical mumbo jumbo. This sequence shows up in like real stuff. Oh yeah. For one, English bell ringing. The number of transitions between changes in the bell order. It's even in the OEIS entry documented by this guy, Arthur T. White, a bell ringing expert. So like, next time I hear bells, I gotta count those transitions and think of this sequence. Go for it. But seriously, it's wild how it pops up in totally different areas like permutations too. Ah, permutations. Refresh my memory. It's how you arrange things. Order matters. And this sequence describes a specific type where you can't move any number more than one spot away from where it started. Like a restricted shuffle. Hold on. This sequence is in bells, card shuffling, what else? Set partitions. It's a way to divide sets into subsets. AVL trees in computer science, how data is organized. It's like a Swiss army knife of math. My mind is officially blown. Never realized how deep this goes. And that's barely scratching the surface. The OEIS entry is loaded with cross-references to other sequences, like a map connecting all these different parts of math. Right, and that's what I love about this whole OEIS thing, how everything's connected. Yeah, you see links to like the Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, which makes sense. But then there's also stuff on binary words, coding theory, all sorts of structures. Like having a map of the math universe. And this 8000071 is the surprise hub connecting all these paths. That's a great way to put it. And I'm telling you, go explore those paths yourself. The OEIS entry is a whole journey worth taking. Back again for more A000071 fun. We were just getting to how this sequence connects to like everything in math. Right, I'm still amazed by all those different meanings we found. The bell ringing, card shuffling, all that. But you mentioned something about a formula with the golden ratio and a ceiling function. Now that's got to be interesting. Let's dive into that. So the golden ratio, you know, is that famous number about 1.618, symbolized by the Greek letter phi. Yeah, it's like the poster child for beautiful proportions in art and nature and stuff. But how does that fit in with our integer sequence here? Well, there's this formula for any term after the third one. An is the ceiling of phi times an minus one. Ooh, that formula looks kind of scary. Break it down for me, please. No worries. The ceiling function just means you round a number up to the nearest integer. So basically you take any term in the sequence, multiply it by that golden ratio, which is about 1.618, and round up, boom, you got the next term. Whoa, really? So that golden ratio is like woven right into how the sequence grows. Exactly. And there are even more formulas, closed form expressions they call them, that directly use phi. And it's kind of like mathematical twins. They're a bit more complicated, but they really highlight the connection between A000071 and the Fibonacci sequence, which is also all about that golden ratio. It's like they're two sides of the same coin connected by this magical number. I love how everything loops back around in math. But okay, enough about golden ratios for now. Let's get back to those different meanings, the combinatorial stuff. You mentioned binary words earlier, but I didn't quite get what that was about. Right, so binary words, those are just strings of zeros and ones, the language of computers. And A000071 tells you how many binary words of length N minus 3 there are that don't have the specific sequence 001 in them. So if N is like 6, we're looking at binary words of length 3, and they can't have 001. Let's see, there's 000, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, and 111. That's seven different words. And hey, that matches the sixth term in our sequence. I think I'm getting it now. You got it. And you know, this whole thing about counting binary words, it's not just a fun puzzle. It connects to fields like coding theory and information theory, where those kinds of sequences are super important. Wow, so we've got bell ringing, card shuffling, set partitions, computer science trees, and coding theory all tied to this one little sequence. Incredible. And we're still just scratching the surface. Remember how we talked about all the cross-references in the OEIS entry, the links to other sequences? Yeah, it's like a giant web connecting all these different parts of the math world. Yeah. So what other cool connections does A000071 have? Well, there are the obvious ones, the Fibonacci numbers, Lucas numbers, those kind of make sense. But then there are links to things like planar trees, lattice paths, even something called the Josephus problem. It's this crazy problem where people are standing in a circle and you eliminate every other person until only one is left. Whoa, that sounds intense. I'll have to look that one up. So this sequence that just seemed like subtracting one from Fibonacci, it's actually a gateway to all these different areas of math. It really is. That's what makes the OEIS so awesome. It's full of these unexpected twists and turns. You start with one sequence and it takes you on this amazing adventure through the world of math. Like a choose-your-own-adventure book for math nerds. Well, speaking of adventure, we're coming to the end of part two here. What kind of exciting finale awaits us in part three? We've covered a lot. The formulas, the different meanings, all those connections. But in the final part, I want to step back and look at the bigger picture. What does the story of A000071 teach us about math itself? Ooh, now that's a question I'm eager to hear the answer to. Make sure you join us next time for the grand finale of our deep dive into A000071. All right, last leg of our A000071 journey. Gotta say, it's ending, gotta say. Yeah, it's been fun digging into this sequence. Who knew it would be so, well, deep? Right, from golden ratio formulas to, like, counting how bells ring, and we just scratched the surface of all those connections. It's a prime example of what's cool about the OEIS. You start with the simple list of numbers and end up down this rabbit hole of math. It makes you realize math isn't just a bunch of separate rules. It's more like a giant web of ideas, all linked together. Exactly, and A000071 is a perfect bridge between different areas, combinatorics, number theory, graphs, even computer science. It shows how math has this underlying unity, like a secret code waiting to be cracked. Like we've been exploring some hidden city with this sequence as our map, showing us how all the different parts fit together. I like that. And just like a city's always changing, so is math. The OEIS itself proves that. New sequences, new connections, new research, all inspired by these lists of numbers. That's what gets me excited. Even though we covered a lot about O000071, there's gotta be more out there. Maybe new meanings, new connections, even applications we haven't thought of yet. For sure.
