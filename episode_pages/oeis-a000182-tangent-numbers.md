## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive, where we keep digging deeper into all these fascinating number sequences from the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. It's really a goldmine if you're into number theory. And today, we're going to tackle sequence A000182. The tangent numbers. Tangent numbers, exactly. And, you know, you glance at those first few terms, you get 1, 2, 16, then it jumps to 272, 7936. It gives you a sense that we're going to be dealing with some pretty quickly growing numbers here. Oh yeah, and the name itself, tangent numbers. I mean, right away you're thinking trigonometry. Well, you'd be right to think so. They actually pop up as coefficients in the exponential generating function for the tangent function. Right, right. For those who love a good power series, tanx can be written as, well, the sum over all non-negative integers, n of a n plus 1, multiplied by x to the power of 2n plus 1, all divided by 2n plus 1 factorial. It's a pretty elegant connection between a trig function and a sequence of integers. And if you're familiar with hyperbolic functions, there's a similar exponential generating function involving tanx that also generates this sequence. Though you might have a plus or minus sign difference, it depends on which convention you're using. But the real exciting part about tangent numbers, it goes beyond just trigonometry. You know, they appear in some really unexpected places, particularly in combinatorics. Yeah, that's the beauty of the OEIS, isn't it? You see these numbers appearing in areas that seem totally unrelated. Like as a number theory student, you start to see those connections between abstract sequences and like counting things and structures, you know. Makes it a lot more tangible. Absolutely. Like take Joyce trees, for example. They're these specific kinds of rooted trees. And the nth tangent number, an, tells you exactly how many Joyce trees there are with 2n1 notes. It's pretty amazing that a sequence tied to the tangent function can tell us something about the number of these tree structures. It really makes you think about those fundamental principles connecting these seemingly, well, separate areas. It really does. And it makes me wonder, what other combinatorial interpretations do these numbers have? I mean, there's got to be more, right? Oh, there definitely is. Like consider tremolo permutations of the set 0, 1, 2. Now a tremolo in music, it's a rapid repeating change in intensity, right? Well, a tremolo permutation is similar in a way. It alternates between increasing and decreasing values. And guess what? The nth tangent number, an, counts exactly how many of these up and down permutations exist. So we're seeing a connection between the tangent function, something analytical, and counting specific patterns and permutations. It's really amazing how these numbers bridge those different mathematical domains. Precisely. And let's delve a bit deeper into the world of trees. an also represents the number of increasing labeled full binary trees with 2n1 vertices. Full binary means each non-leaf node has two children, left and right, which are considered distinct. Labeled means each vertex has a unique number, usually from 1 to 2n1. And increasing means that the label of a child is always bigger than its parent's label. Wow, that's a pretty specific set of conditions for a binary tree. The fact that tangent numbers count these structures suggests a pretty deep connection between how these trees are ordered and how the tangent sequence behaves. Exactly. And the connections to trees don't stop there. an also counts the number of increasing strict binary trees with 2n1 nodes. If you're curious about the permutations associated with these trees, there's another OEIS sequence, a245894, that dives into that. It's a good reminder that within the OEIS, you often find a whole network of related sequences, each offering a different perspective on the same mathematical idea. Right. It's almost like these numbers have a secret code that shows up in all these different structures. It really highlights how interconnected math is, wouldn't you say? Absolutely. Now let's try a different counting problem. Think about all the permutations of the set 2n. That's just the integers from 1 to 2n. If you insert these numbers in order into a binary search tree, the tangent number an tells you how many of those starting permutations will give you a maximally full binary search tree, meaning the final tree will only have one node with a single child. It's a really specific constraint on the tree's shape, all dictated by the initial order you insert the numbers. That's fascinating. It's like only certain orderings lead to this almost perfectly balanced tree, and the number of those orderings is given by our tangent numbers. Exactly. And lastly, in the realm of combinatorics, an also represents the number of standard young tableau of a particular skew shape. This shape is created by taking a large partition, n1, n2, 3, 2, and removing a smaller partition, n1, n2, n3, 2, 1. So for those familiar with the representation theory of symmetric groups and young tableau, this shows a link between tangent numbers and these algebraic structures. So from counting trees and permutations to these more abstract young tableau, the tangent numbers are really popping up all over combinatorics. But it doesn't end there, right? There's got to be connections to other parts of math, too. You're absolutely right. One elegant connection is to alternating permutations, sometimes called zigzag or up-down permutations. When n is odd, the nth tangent number, remember we're using the OEIS indexing where the first term is a1, equals the number of alternating permutations of the set 1, p, 2. So these are permutations that go up, then down, then up again, and so on. Ah, so it ties back to those tremolo permutations we talked about earlier. This up-and-down pattern seems to be a common thread when tangent numbers appear in combinatorics. Exactly. And if we look at the Hankel transform of the tangent number sequence, we see even more structure. For odd n, the Hankel transform of a000182 is the same as the nth term of a000178. Now, the Hankel transform, it's basically a way to create a new sequence from an old one by looking at determinants of matrices formed by its terms. The fact that the Hankel transform of tangent numbers connects to another well-known OEIS sequence, the zigzag numbers, suggests a deeper algebraic relationship between the two. Interestingly, the zigzag Hankel transform of a000182 also gives us a000178. It's amazing how these transforms can reveal hidden connections between sequences, like having a special lens that lets you see the underlying mathematical landscape. And the connections keep going. Tangent numbers are linked to Euler and Bernoulli polynomials, which are, well, fundamental in number theory and analysis. They also tie into zigzag numbers, those trigonometric functions we saw at the beginning, and even the Fourier transform of a square wave, a concept you find in signal processing. Pretty remarkable how a sequence of integers can connect such diverse areas. A square wave, huh? That is a surprising connection. Shows you that math can pop up in the most unexpected places. It certainly does. They even show up in the context of quantum algebras, which are deformations of classical lie algebras and important in modern physics, and in integrals over n-dimensional hypercubes and green functions. Hodges and Sukumaran did some work on that. These connections make you think that maybe the patterns in tangent numbers have applications in all sorts of scientific and mathematical frameworks. It seems like everywhere you look in math, there's some interaction with these tangent numbers. It's an incredibly intricate web of connections. And it delves into some pretty advanced areas, too. Tangent numbers are related to the Sheffer-Appel operator calculus, a powerful tool for studying polynomial sequences. They also satisfy a Riccati differential equation, which can be used to generate Meixner-Pollacheck and Krautchek orthogonal polynomials. Orthogonal polynomials, as you know, are important in things like approximation theory and numerical analysis. So these links to operator calculus and differential equations point to a more analytical structure underlying the tangent numbers, wouldn't you say? Precisely. And there are connections to an elliptic curve, a Weierstrass elliptic function, the Lorentz formal group law, which pops up in algebraic topology and theoretical physics, a Lie infinitesimal generator, and even the Eulerian numbers, which is sequence A0008292 in the OEIS. Sequence A15585 goes into more detail about these advanced relationships. What all this means is that tangent numbers aren't just some isolated curiosity. They're embedded within this rich tapestry of mathematical structures. The depth of these connections is really astonishing. It goes way beyond what you might initially think when you see them as coefficients of a simple trig function. A real testament to the unity of mathematics, wouldn't you say? Definitely. And one final connection along those lines. The absolute values of the alternating sums of the odd-numbered rows of the Eulerian triangle, that's A0008292, which tabulates Eulerian numbers, give us the tangent numbers. It's worth noting that the even-numbered rows of this triangle always have alternating sums of zero, so it's this fascinating pattern within another fundamental combinatorial sequence that leads to our tangent numbers. So the patterns within the Eulerian triangle, which count permutations by their number of ascents, those patterns also hold the secret to our tangent numbers. It's like uncovering hidden relationships between seemingly unrelated combinatorial statistics. Okay, so shifting gears a bit. Do these tangent numbers themselves have any interesting properties, maybe in modular arithmetic? Yes, they do. They exhibit some fascinating modular
