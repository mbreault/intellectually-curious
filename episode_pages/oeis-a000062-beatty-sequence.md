## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. We're continuing our exploration of intriguing integer sequences from the OEIS, and today we're going to focus on A000062, which is 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and so on. And you might be wondering what's so special about this seemingly random string of numbers. Well, get ready to have your mind blown as we uncover the hidden beauty and surprising connections within this sequence. I think one of the things that's so intriguing right off the bat with A000062 is the formula. AN equals floor of N over the quantity E minus 2. The fact that it incorporates E, Euler's constant, is a big clue that we're dealing with something special. So for those who may not be familiar, the floor function, what does that mean? Basically, we're taking a number and stepping down to the nearest integer. You can imagine yourself on a staircase. It doesn't matter where you are on that step. You're going to go down to that solid step below you. So in this sequence, we're taking multiples of 1 over the quantity E minus 2 and then using that floor function to find the nearest integer below each multiple. But the story doesn't end there. This formula hints at a deeper mathematical concept, BD sequences. BD sequences. Tell me more. These sequences are named after the mathematician Samuel BD. And essentially, they're formed by taking the floor of positive multiples of an irrational number. And in the case of A000062, that irrational number is 1 over the quantity E minus 2. So it sounds like we're kind of looking at a specific type of BD sequence, one that is generated by this particular irrational number. Exactly. Now, I've heard that BD sequences have something called complementary sequences. What's that all about? That's where Rayleigh's theorem, sometimes called BD's theorem, comes into play. And this theorem states that for any irrational number greater than 1, we'll call it R, there exists another irrational number, S, where the BD sequences generated by R and S perfectly partition the positive integers. Wait, hold on a second. You're telling me that we can take two irrational numbers, generate these sequences using the floor function, and together they'll contain every single positive integer exactly once without any overlaps? Yep, that's exactly what I'm saying. It's really quite remarkable. That's incredible. And you know what? The OEIS entry for A000062 actually provides its complementary sequence. Oh, wow. It's A194807. And this complementary sequence is generated by 1 over the quantity E minus 2 divided by the quantity 1 over the quantity E minus 2 minus 1. Wow. So essentially, if we were to write out both A000062 and A194807, we'd essentially have a complete list of all positive integers, each appearing only once. Yeah. It's kind of mind-boggling to think about how these two seemingly separate sequences arising from irrational numbers create such a perfect division. And this concept of complementary BD sequences isn't just limited to A000062. It applies to other irrational numbers as well. For instance, the lower and upper Weichhoff sequences, which use the golden ratio, also demonstrates property. So we've got the golden ratio, but there's also what's fascinating is there are even sequences generated by the square root of 2 and pi that exhibit this same pattern of complementary sequences. Who knew irrational numbers could be so organized? It really highlights the elegance and interconnectedness of mathematics. But what's truly captivating is that this theoretical concept of BD sequences actually has a surprising real-world connection to music. Wait, music? There's a link between these sequences and something as artistic as music. You got it. I got to hear this. Believe it or not, the arrangement of black and white keys on a piano keyboard can be viewed as BD sequences. What? The specific pattern of those keys can be represented using BD sequences with R equals 127 and S equals 125. Wow. I never would have guessed that something as familiar as a piano keyboard would have such a deep mathematical underpinning. It makes you think what other hidden mathematical patterns are out there in the world just waiting for us to discover them. And just when you think it can't get any more complex, there are generalizations of BD sequences, like the Lamech-Moser theorem. This theorem expands the concept to other integer functions and their inverses, showing us that this partitioning of integers is a much broader phenomenon than we might initially assume. Right. So we've uncovered so much about A000062, from its formula and connection to BD sequences to its complementary sequence and a real-world application in music. It's amazing. There's clearly a lot more to explore here. Absolutely. We've only scratched the surface. And you know what? The OEIS entry for A000062 even mentions a connection to something called Sturmian words. Sturmian words. Okay, that's new one for me. So these are infinite sequences of characters that have a specific property related to the number of distinct substrings of a given length. Okay. But what's really remarkable is that the first differences in a BD sequence, that is, the differences between consecutive terms, actually form a characteristic Sturmian word. So you're saying if we took the BD sequence for A000062 and we calculated the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers, that sequence of differences would actually be a Sturmian word? That's right. Wow. This is getting deep, even for the deep dive. That's right. It seems like the more we dig into A000062, the more intricate and interconnected it becomes. It's like a mathematical rabbit hole. But a very fascinating one. And to think that we're exploring all this from just one integer sequence, A000062. Right. The OEIS is filled with hundreds of thousands of these sequences, each with their own unique properties and connections, just waiting to be discovered. Yes, exactly. It's a treasure trove of mathematical knowledge, and I encourage all of our listeners to spend some time exploring the OEIS. You never know what mathematical gems you might stumble upon. It's like having an entire encyclopedia dedicated to the language of mathematics at your fingertips. It truly is a remarkable resource and a testament to the collaborative nature of mathematics. You know, mathematicians from all over the world are contributing to this ever-growing collection of knowledge. It's very inspiring to see people from such diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise coming together to create something as comprehensive and impactful as the OEIS. Absolutely. And it underscores the importance of sharing knowledge and making it accessible to everyone. Speaking of accessibility, one of the things I really appreciate about the OEIS is how it presents complex mathematical concepts in a way that's relatively easy to grasp, even for someone who might not have a deep mathematical background. Yeah, I agree. The OEIS strikes a really nice balance between providing that in-depth information for the experts while also remaining accessible to a wider audience. For sure. It's a valuable resource for students, educators, researchers, and anyone with an interest in mathematics. Exactly.

It's a journey without end, filled with wonder and endless possibilities for exploration. And we hope that this deep dive into A000062 has sparked your curiosity and inspired you to embark on your own mathematical adventures. Speaking of further exploration, I think it's worth pointing out that the Wikipedia entry on BD sequences mentions a couple of interesting generalizations. Oh, right. It mentions how Rayleigh's theorem can be extended to include positive real numbers, not just irrational ones, and even negative integers. Right. And then there's the Lamech-Moser theorem, which broadens the concept even further. Exactly. And it's a reminder that mathematical concepts often have really far-reaching implications and can be generalized in ways that we might not initially anticipate. Yeah, it's like those Russian nesting dolls where you open one up to reveal another one and another one and so on. Right. There's always another layer of complexity and beauty to uncover. That's a great analogy. And it speaks to the idea that mathematics is a constantly evolving field, you know, with new discoveries and connections being made all the time. Yeah. It's exciting to think about what other mathematical mysteries are still out there just waiting to be unlocked. Indeed.
