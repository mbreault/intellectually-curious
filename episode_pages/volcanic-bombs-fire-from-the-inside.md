## Transcript

Welcome to our deep dive. We're going to explore volcanic bombs. You know those fiery projectiles launched from volcanoes? Definitely fiery. We're going to look at how they form, the crazy variety of shapes, and what they tell scientists. They really can reveal quite a bit about a volcano. Plus, we'll even see how knowing about them affects us. Uh, well, hopefully not too directly. Haha, yeah, true. Yeah. But, you know, just the general danger element adds a bit of excitement, wouldn't you say? Absolutely. Volcanoes are fascinating. Okay, so to kick things off, could you remind us what exactly makes a volcanic bomb? I mean, I know it's not just any rock a volcano spits out. You're right. It comes down to size and state. To be a bomb, it has to be bigger than 64 millimeters. So picture a golf ball, but often way bigger. Okay, got it. And importantly, it's got to be at least partially molten when it's launched. That's what lets them form those wild shapes as they fly through the air. Like fiery sculptures almost. Exactly. We're talking molten, or at least semi-molten, rock, sometimes bigger than a basketball, flying through the air. That's pretty dramatic. Oh, for sure. And there's a whole system for classifying them. Like a field guide to fiery projectiles. Exactly. And just like a guide helps you with birds or plants, knowing the bomb types helps scientists understand the eruption. Intriguing. So what are some common shapes, and what can they tell us about what's going on inside the volcano? Well, one striking shape is the ribbon bomb. It's long and stretched out, almost like taffy. Okay, I can picture that. They form from fluid magma. You know, imagine something with a honey-like consistency. As it's thrown out, it stretches, and surface tension helps make it thin. So runny magma, ribbon bomb. What about thicker magma? What kinds of bombs do we get from that? Think peanut butter. That's what viscous magma is like. It doesn't flow easy. Ah, so it doesn't stretch out nicely like the honey example. Right. Instead of stretching, it tends to make irregular shapes. Like those cool breadcrust bombs I've seen pictures of? You got it. That cracked surface tells you the magma was viscous. The outer layer cools and hardens, but inside it's still hot and gassy and expanding, so it cracks the crust. Wow, so it's like a mini eruption happening inside the bomb itself. Kind of, yeah. Okay, so ribbon bombs from runny magma, breadcrust from thicker. What other shapes should we be looking for? Well, there are spherical bombs, basically blobs of lava that cooled into almost perfect spheres. Surface tension at work again. Makes sense. And then you have spindle or almond-shaped ones. Those form when the blob of magma is spinning as it's ejected. Like a fiery football. Exactly. So just by looking at the shape, we can tell how it formed, and even something about the magma. That's incredible. But I mean, we've got to be real here. These bombs aren't just curiosities, are they? They're pretty dangerous. Absolutely. We're talking about molten rock being hurled with a lot of force. They can travel for kilometers and cause a lot of damage, depending on their size and speed. I remember reading about the eruption of Galera's volcano back in 93 in Colombia. Sadly, some scientists were killed by volcanic bombs. Yeah, it's a tragic reminder of how dangerous they can be. And even a smaller bomb can be dangerous. That's scary to think about. It was during the Kilauea eruption in 2018 in Hawaii. A basketball-sized bomb landed on a tour boat and injured over 20 people. Oh, wow. That's terrifying. So while we might be fascinated by these volcanic bombs, we've got to respect their power. But beyond the danger aspect, what makes them so interesting to scientists? I mean, what can they actually tell us about volcanoes? Well, for one thing, they give us a peek into the volcano's plumbing. Remember those cord bombs we talked about with the older material wrapped in fresh lava? Oh, yeah. Like a little time capsule. Exactly. By analyzing the core, scientists can learn about the rocks beneath the surface and even get clues about past eruptions. They're bringing us samples from inside the volcano. Is there anything else they can tell us? Like, can they help predict future eruptions? You know, they actually can. Remember how the bomb shapes are linked to magma viscosity? Yeah. Well, if scientists see a shift in the types of bombs during an eruption, it could mean the magma is changing or conditions inside the volcano are shifting. Ah, so it could be a warning sign that things are changing and maybe a more explosive eruption is coming. Right. It's like the volcano is sending us a message. In the form of molten rocks. Yeah, pretty much. And if we can understand that message, we can better assess the risks and maybe save lives. This is all so fascinating. I never knew we could learn so much from these bombs. So how do scientists actually study them? Do they just go out and collect them after an eruption? Well, fieldwork is definitely a big part of it. I bet. They'll carefully map out where the bombs landed, measure their size, and document their shapes. Makes sense. But they also use high-tech tools to get a better understanding. Like what? Tell me they use lasers. Um, well, lasers are used for some remote sensing, but for volcanic bombs, thermal imaging is really useful. Oh, okay. Like those heat-sensing cameras you see in movies. Exactly. Thermal imaging lets scientists see the bombs while they're still hot. Ah, so cool. And it can also be used to track lava flows in real time. That's really important for monitoring eruptions and figuring out the hazards. Wow, so they're actually tracking these bombs. What else do they do? Well, they take them back to the lab, of course. Makes sense. What happens at the lab? That's where the real detective work starts. They'll analyze what the bomb is made of to understand the type of magma and what was happening inside the volcano. Wow. They'll also look at the texture under a microscope to learn about its cooling history. So each bomb carries a record of its journey from inside the Earth to the surface. Exactly. And by piecing together those records, scientists can start to understand the story of a volcano. That's amazing. We've covered so much, from shapes and dangers to how they're used for research. But, you know, before we get too deep, I think we need to step back and consider why anyone should care about these volcanic bombs. Like, why does it matter to the average person? It's a great question. I think there are a few reasons. First, they're a reminder of how powerful volcanoes are. Yeah, we tend to forget that until we see those pictures of molten rock being thrown around. Exactly. Second, understanding these bombs helps scientists assess the risks of future eruptions. They can use the information to better protect communities that live near volcanoes. So it's not just about scientific curiosity. It has real-world applications. Absolutely. And finally, let's be honest, they're just really cool. True. They spark our curiosity and remind us of the power of nature. I agree. Well, we've covered a lot already, but there's still so much to learn about volcanic bombs. We'll be back with part two, where we'll dive even deeper. Looking forward to it. Welcome back to our deep dive into volcanic bombs. Ready for more? Oh, absolutely. Last time we were talking about how those bombs can help scientists figure out what's going on deep inside a volcano. I mean, you said they can even provide clues about past eruptions. That just blows my mind. It is pretty amazing, like having a time machine almost. You know those bombs can actually help us reconstruct those past eruptions. Really? How does that work? Well, imagine a detective at a crime scene. They're looking for clues, anything to piece together what happened. Yeah, I get it. It's the same with volcanic bombs. Scientists carefully map out where they landed, how far they traveled, what size they are. Oh, so a bigger bomb means a more powerful eruption. You got it. And the direction they're scattered can tell you which way the blast went. Like putting a puzzle together, but with molten rock. Exactly. Scientists can figure out the force of the blast, how high the eruption was, even which way the wind was blowing. So the more we know about past eruptions, the better we can figure out what a volcano might do in the future. Right. If a volcano has a history of big eruptions and bombs flying everywhere, that's important to know. Makes sense. So it's not just about the bomb itself, but how it fits into the whole story of the volcano. Yeah. And you know, speaking of the big picture, they actually play a big role in shaping the landscape. That's right. We've been talking about how they can fly for kilometers. Over time, all those eruptions must really change things. Oh, absolutely. Think about it. Countless bombs raining down over thousands, even millions of years. Wow. So it's not just one bomb's impact, but the total effect over time. Right. They can actually create some pretty impressive features, like scoria cones. Scoria cones. Isn't scoria that dark, holy rock you see around volcanoes? You got it. It's full of holes from gas bubbles escaping as the lava cools. And volcanic bombs are often made of scoria, so they're basically the building blocks of these cones. Okay, so imagine a volcano erupts, throws up all these scoria bombs, and they pile up around the vent. Over time, you get
