## Transcript

All right, so you wanted to know more about Bollywood. Hindi cinema. Hindi cinema. And we got a whole bunch of stuff, like a history of Hindi cinema. Yeah, Wikipedia. Wikipedia, lists of best actors and actresses. So yeah, let's dive in. You know, it's interesting when you start looking at all this stuff just how big Bollywood is. It's not just like a regional thing. I mean, this is global. And I think what we really want to do today is give you like kind of a history of it, introduce you to some of the key figures, and also some of the surprising ways it's impacted culture, not just in India, but around the world. Okay, so I think the first thing we've got to do is like, what is Bollywood? Like, what is that word even? Yeah, Bollywood, it's a portmanteau, obviously. Bombay and Hollywood. Right. But you got to be careful because it really refers specifically to the Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai. Okay. Now, people use it kind of loosely to talk about all Indian cinema, which is super diverse, but Bollywood is specifically the Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai. Okay, so Bollywood equals Hindi cinema coming out of Mumbai. Right. But it's also huge. I mean, it's a global thing. It's a global thing. Hindi cinema, I mean, it consistently ranks as one of the top film producers worldwide, just in terms of the number of films they're putting out every year. Yeah, I mean, the amount of films. The amount of films. I mean, in 2017, for example, almost 2,000 films were certified in India. Over 360 of those were in Hindi. Wow. And then you look at the box office, like within India. Hindi cinema, it has a huge share, you know? In 2022, it was like a third of the total. So language-wise, was it always Hindi? I mean, now it's this huge industry, but how did that evolve? That's a great question. Early Hindi films, they used what's described as like a vernacular Hindustani. So it's a language that was really widely understood across North India by speakers of Hindi and Urdu. But contemporary Bollywood, like today, they weave in a lot of Hinglish. Hinglish, exactly. So, I mean, part of this is just reflecting like the changing urban landscape of India, where English is just more and more prevalent. And it also probably helps them connect with a broader, more international audience. This isn't just about like sprinkling in a couple of English words here and there. I mean, they're code-switching within sentences. They're using Romanized Hindi and subtitles. Oh, wow. Even song lyrics. It really reflects that kind of multilingual reality of a lot of urban Indians. That's really interesting. Okay, so we know what it is. We know where it is, the language it uses. Right. But how did it get to Mumbai? Like what happened before Mumbai? Well, Mumbai is like the heartland now. Right. But the story actually goes back further to other film centers. So before the partition of India in 1947, the Bombay film industry, they were super connected with Lahore. Okay. Now Lahore at that time was like a big hub for film production in Hindustani. Some people even call it Lolliwood. And then Calcutta in Bengal, another really crucial center. So they were producing films in Bengali, but also in Hindustani. Oh, okay. So in the aftermath of the partition, you had a lot of talented actors, filmmakers, musicians, everybody. They migrated from Lahore and Calcutta to Bombay, which really kind of solidified it as the primary center for Hindustani language film production. So the talent went to where the industry was, it sounds like. Exactly. That's a good way to put it. So in those early days, like what were the stories they were telling? What was driving those stories? So the Indian independence movement was huge. Yeah. And it really shaped a lot of the themes that early Hindi cinema explored. Okay. And the filmmakers themselves, like guys like Bimal Roy, the poet and lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi, the actor Prithviraj Kapoor, they were all super involved in the movement. They saw cinema as this powerful tool for social reform, for addressing the lives of ordinary people, the challenges they were facing. You know, the Indian People's Theatre Association, formed in 1942, really played a big role here too. I mean, they brought together all these artists who were using theatre to kind of ignite patriotism, to support the freedom movement. And one of the big films that came out of this period was Kismet in 1943. Okay. It was a crime thriller, but with these strong patriotic undertones. Interesting. And it actually became the first Indian film to cross the one crore rupee mark. At the box office. At the box office. That's huge, especially back then. Back then. I mean, this is 1943. We're talking about the economic climate. The industry was just kind of starting. It really showed just how much potential reach and commercial viability Bollywood had. Wow. Okay, so who are some of the big names that we should know from those early days? Oh, man, there's so many. But I think first and foremost, Dadasaheb Falk, you got to know him. He's considered the father of Indian cinema. He directed India's first full-length feature film back in 1913. Then you have these pioneering filmmakers, guys like Mahboob Khan. Oh, yeah. He's famous for his social dramas, Mother India in 1957. That was his big one. Yeah. Huge influence. Also the first Indian film to be nominated for an Oscar. Then you've got K. Asif. You can't forget him. Okay. He's the guy behind the epic Mughal-e-Azam. It's just a visual masterpiece. And of course, Dilip Kumar, known as the Tragedy King. Yeah. He was known for his acting style. It was so nuanced, so naturalistic. Films like Divdas, Mughal-e-Azam. But he also wrote and produced Ganga Jumna. Oh, really? Yeah. So these early pioneers, they really set the stage for everything that came after. They were the foundation. Wow. So you have this social consciousness in the early days, and then you have these people that everybody knows. So what happened next? What about the 70s and 80s? That seems to be a big deal, according to this stuff. Oh, yeah. That's when we get into what they call classic Hindi cinema. Okay. And there was a big shift in the kinds of stories they were telling, the romantic themes from earlier. They started giving way to, you know, grittier stories, more action-oriented narratives. A lot of them focused on crime, on the underworld, like the Bombay underworld and dacoits, these bandits, became really popular subjects for these films. And 1975 seems to have been a huge year. Absolutely. So in 1975, you had two films that really just embodied this change. The first was Zanjeer. Yeah. It starred Amitabh Bachchan. Right. It was written by this super successful screenwriting duo, Salim Javed. Okay. And it's seen as kind of igniting the action genre. I see. And it also really established Bachchan's angry young man persona. Right, right. The other big one that year was Sholay. This was a total blockbuster. Okay. It was co-written by Salim Khan, who's actually Salman Khan's father. Oh, wow. Yeah. Sholay became this cultural phenomenon. I mean, the characters, the dialogue, people still quote it today. Oh, wow. I did not know that. Okay, so Deewar also keeps popping up in our notes here. Why is that one so important? So Deewar came out in the mid-70s. It also starred Amitabh Bachchan. It was also written by Salim Javed. Oh. And even Danny Boyle, the famous director, calls it absolutely key to Indian cinema. It was inspired by an earlier film, Ganga Jamna. And it also kind of took some things from the life of a real-life Bombay smuggler, Haji Mastan. The film is about these two brothers who end up on opposite sides of the law. One's a policeman, the other's a gangster. Oh, wow. So it really looks at morality, poverty, family bonds. It just really captured something about the time. It sounds like Amitabh Bachchan and Salim Javed were like the dream team. Yeah, they were a force to be reckoned with. So you've got the angry young man image just totally embodied by Bachchan in these films like Deewar, Zanjeer. It spoke to a whole generation that was dealing with social and economic issues. And Salim Javed, I mean, they were masters at these gritty, action-packed stories that defined the 70s and 80s. They didn't just define the genre, they left a mark on the whole industry. Yeah, it seems like it. So there's also a little note here about Tootin. Tootin, yeah. It says it was the first Indian film to be shot in Mauritius. That's right. It came out in 83. Rajesh Khanna starred in it. Okay. And I think it shows how even back then, Bollywood filmmakers were going to international locations to shoot their films. Right. Maybe to add a little exotic flavor to their stories. Makes sense. It looks like, though, that this golden age of action and crime, it didn't last forever. Yeah, so towards the late 80s, things took a bit of a dip
