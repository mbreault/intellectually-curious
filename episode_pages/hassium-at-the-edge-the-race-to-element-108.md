A deep dive into hassium, the super-heavy element at the edge of the periodic table. We trace its birth in 1978 (JINR) and 1984 (GSI), explore cold fusion and magic numbers, unpack the Transfermium Wars around its naming, and glimpse the few experiments that hint at its chemistryâ€”and the tantalizing possibility that Hassium-292 might exist naturally on Earth.

## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. Ready for another deep dive. Today, we're going to the edge of the periodic table. To the edge. Yeah, to explore hassium. Hassium. It's a super heavy synthetic element, which basically means... Not found naturally. Right, it has to be created in a lab. Wow. And we've got some cool sources to guide us. Wikipedia. Okay. And a dedicated article all about the history of hassium. Interesting. We'll be uncovering how scientists create elements like this. Okay. The whole drama surrounding how it got its name. Seems juicy. And get this, the idea that there might be like a tiny little bit of hassium hidden somewhere deep within the Earth. Wow, really? Yes, maybe we should start with like a super quick explanation. What exactly makes an element super heavy? Well, generally when we talk about super heavy elements, we're talking about elements with atomic numbers greater than 103. Oh, okay. And like you mentioned, they're all synthetic, meaning they don't just exist naturally, you know? Yeah. Gotta make them in a lab. So I'm guessing creating hassium wasn't just mixing a few chemicals together. You're absolutely right. Had to be more complicated than that. It was a challenge for sure, actually. It involved two different labs. So back in 1978 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. That's a mouthful. It is, JINR for short. Okay, JINR. In Dubna, Russia, their team, they bombarded radium with calcium, hoping to fuse those nuclei and create element 108, you know, hassium. Right. But interpreting that data, it proved to be a real challenge. So the first attempt didn't quite work out? It didn't. So what happened next? Well, fast forward a few years to 1984, we're at the Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Schwerionenforschung. Wow. Try saying that three times fast. Don't even try. It's GSI for short. Much easier, GSI. Located in Darmstadt, Germany. Okay. And this team, they took a different approach. They bombarded lead with iron nuclei. And this time... Success. They synthesized hassium. A big win for the Germans. But I am curious, if both teams were basically trying to do the same thing, fuse nuclei, what made GSI's method work and not JINR's? That's where cold fusion comes into play. It's different from the hot fusion we often hear about, which involves smashing nuclei together at really high energies. Right. But the problem is you create these super unstable nuclei that decay really quickly. So cold fusion is a bit more controlled. Exactly. It's more precise. And it was actually pioneered by Yuri Oganeshin. He led that first attempt at JINR, you know, the one we were just talking about. Yeah. And with cold fusion, they use specific nuclei that have what we call magic numbers of protons and neutrons. Hold on. Magic numbers. What's all that about? So think of it this way. Protons and neutrons in a nucleus, they occupy energy levels, kind of like, you know, how electrons orbit an atom. Right. And when those levels are completely filled, that's when you hit those magic numbers. And the nucleus becomes much more stable. When they fuse using this cold fusion method, they release less energy. And that helps create those longer-lived super heavy elements. So it's not just brute force. There's some finesse to it. Exactly. And that's how the GSI team was able to create a few different isotopes of hassium. But even with this more controlled technique, they're still incredibly unstable. Like their half-lives measured in milliseconds. Milliseconds. Wow. They barely exist. They don't. And then on top of that, there's this whole story of how hassium even got its name. Because it wasn't always called hassium, was it? Ooh, now I really want to know. What's the tea? Okay, so there's actually a whole history of kind of fierce competition between different labs, all trying to discover these new elements. Oh, wow. Which, of course, leads to a lot of disputes about who gets naming rights. Makes sense. It's been called the Transfermium Wars. Because it all revolves around elements beyond fermium. Fermium. Element number 100. Gotcha. So what about hassium? Well, the German team, GSI, they first proposed honium. Honium. To honor Otto Hahn. Who's that? He's a physicist, a pioneer in nuclear fission. Okay. Seems fitting, right? Yeah, it does. But the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry... IUPAC. Yeah, IUPAC. They're the ones who officially approve element names. Right. And they actually felt that honium was a bit too obscure for such a significant element. So even naming an element can be controversial. It can be. So what happened? Well, they finally reached a compromise in 1997. And element 108 was officially named hassium. Hassium. After the German state of Hess. For GSI is. Exactly. So hassium finally got a name, but with such a short lifespan, like, how much do we actually know about this element? That's a great question. Like, what have scientists been able to actually observe? Well, because of that super short half-life, most of what we know about hassium actually comes from theoretical calculations, not direct observation. Oh, wow. But there have been some pretty fascinating experiments that have given us, you know, at least a little peek into its chemical behavior. So, I mean, we're talking about an element that only exists for milliseconds. It's crazy. And we can mostly only understand it through theoretical calculations. Yeah. So have scientists been able to observe any of its actual chemical properties? Well, it might seem kind of impossible, but yeah. Really? And this is where things get really exciting. In 2001. Okay. Scientists used this technique. It's called gas thermochromatography. Okay, gas thermochromatography. That sounds pretty intense. Oh, it was a mouthful, yeah. Can you, like, break that down for us normal people? Yeah. Basically, it's a method where you heat up a mixture of gases and then you watch how the different components travel and how they deposit on a surface. It all depends on how easily they evaporate, you know, their volatility. So, like, I'm imagining this cloud of gases all separating out like some high-stakes science fair project. Pretty much, yeah. But how did they even manage to use this with hassium? I mean, it doesn't stick around for very long. Right. It was incredible. So, first they created a few atoms of hassium using the same nuclear fusion techniques we talked about earlier. Right, right. But then they quickly, quickly reacted those hassium atoms with oxygen to form hassium tetroxide. Hassium tetroxide, okay. Which is predicted to be pretty volatile. Like, it's a counterpart osmium tetroxide. So they, like, created this teeny tiny puff of hassium tetroxide gas and then just, like, watched it move around. That's it. And by carefully comparing the temperature at which that hassium tetroxide deposited compared to osmium tetroxide, scientists were able to confirm that hassium actually behaves like a heavier member of group 8 on the periodic table. Wow. Both form volatile tetroxides. So one experiment, a few precious atoms, and bam, they confirm a key chemical property. Amazing, isn't it? It really is. Were there any other experiments that helped understand hassium's behavior? There's another really cool one. In 2004, so scientists took that hassium tetroxide and they reacted it with sodium hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide, that's a strong base, right? Yeah, you got it. Like, think drain cleaner. Oh, okay. And this reaction is a total classic in chemistry, often used to identify certain metals. Right. And in this case, what they ended up with was sodium hassite. Sodium hassite. Which is pretty similar to the osmates that are formed when osmium tetroxide reacts with sodium hydroxide. Okay, so again, this seems to confirm hassium's place in group 8 and that it's, like, similar to osmium, like chemical cousins. Exactly. It gives us even more evidence that even with those relativistic effects we were talking about earlier, hassium's chemistry still lines up pretty well with its lighter relatives in group 8. It's all connected. Hmm. So we've got these volatile tetroxides and the reactions with strong bases. Right. It seems like we're, like, starting to put the pieces together. And speaking of putting things together, those magic numbers, the ones we discussed earlier, those aren't just important for creating hassium, are they? They also play a part in how stable it is. Yeah. You got it. Some isotopes of hassium are predicted to be more stable because of those magic numbers of protons and neutrons. Which brings us back to hassium-292, right? Right. That hypothetical isotope that could hold the key to, like, naturally occurring hassium. Maybe. So has there been any experimental evidence to support that it actually exists? Well, for now, hassium-292 is still just theoretical. But scientists are actively looking for it, both in the lab and in nature. You see, if this isotope is as stable as we predict, then that could mean that, you know, teeny tiny amounts of hassium have actually always existed on Earth, hidden in certain minerals. Oh, wow. So what if we could actually create stable isotopes of hassium in larger quantities? Ah, the possibilities. What would that mean for, like, science and technology
