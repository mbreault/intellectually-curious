## Transcript

Hey everyone and welcome back for another deep dive. Today we're going to be unearthing a period of history that's often kind of brushed aside, you know, the Copper Age. It's more than just a quick pit stop between the Stone and Bronze Ages, right? This era is absolutely packed with innovation and it really set the stage for the complex societies we see today. Absolutely. It's where we start to see the earliest hints of things like organized mining, long distance trade, all that good stuff. It's really fascinating how the Copper Age kind of challenges our traditional view of technological advancement. You know, we often assume it was this simple linear progression like, oh, Stone Age to a little bit of copper and then boom, right to bronze. But the reality is that many regions were working with copper for centuries. They developed really sophisticated societies all based on this one versatile metal. And this was long before bronze technology even showed up on the scene. Okay, so let's unpack this a bit. To really understand the Copper Age, we have to start with the star of the show, right? Copper itself. What was it about this metal that was so captivating to our ancestors? Well, one key difference is that copper can be shamped in ways that, say, flint just can't. Copper is malleable. It's ductile. So you can hammer it into different shapes. You can draw it into wires. That kind of flexibility opened up a whole world of possibilities for toolmaking. That makes sense. But I'm curious, you know, we often take it for granted that metal is better for tools. But why exactly was copper seen as like so much more valuable than something like flint? Well, copper holds a sharper edge for much longer. And you can rework it unlike flint. Plus, and this is a big one, you can actually find copper naturally occurring in its metallic form. No complicated smelting needed. So they could just pick it up and... Exactly. That's pretty cool. Yeah, our ancestors could just pick it up and start shaping it. Imagine, you know, stumbling upon this shiny reddish metal and realizing, hey, I can make something useful out of this. That ease of access allowed humans to start working with copper as early as 9000 BC in the Middle East. So early. I know. And even earlier in parts of North America. Oh, wow. Yeah. So they just hammered away at this naturally occurring copper. Exactly. That's called cold working. Essentially, you just repeatedly hammer the copper into the shape that you want. But as you can imagine, cold working, it has its limits. Later on, humans discovered smelting, this revolutionary process of heating copper ore to extract the metal. So smelting really was a game changer, huh? Oh, absolutely. Didn't that allow for much larger quantities of copper to be extracted? Precisely. Because I'm imagining it would have been way more difficult to find large deposits of naturally occurring copper. It would have been, yeah. Smelting opened up a whole new level of sophistication in tool making. And it allowed societies to really scale up their copper production. That's fascinating. Speaking of sophisticated copper tools, remember Etsy the Iceman? Oh, yeah. That incredibly well-preserved mummy found in the Alps? Wasn't he carrying a copper axe? He was. Etsy lived around 3300 BC. And his axe was made of nearly pure copper. What's even more fascinating is that the arsenic found in his hair suggests that he might have been involved in copper production itself. Wait, arsenic? Yeah. What does arsenic have to do with copper? Well, arsenic is a common impurity in copper ore. So it's likely that Etsy was exposed to arsenic during the smelting process. I see. And this little detail, it tells us so much. Not just about the tools people were using, but the potential health hazards of early metallurgy. Oh, wow. It even hints at Etsy's role in his community. Wow, that is a fantastic example of how archaeological discoveries could just transport us back in time. Yeah, right. And give us a glimpse into the lives of these Copper Age people. Absolutely. It really makes you realize this wasn't just some abstract historical period. No. But real people, you know? Yeah. Living, working, trading, and sometimes, unfortunately, being exposed to arsenic. Right. And speaking of trade, let's tackle a big misconception about the Copper Age. Yeah. People tend to think of it as just a quick stop on the way to the Bronze Age, you know? Right. A simple transition phase. Yeah, like a stepping stone. Yeah, I can see why people might think that, but I have a feeling it's a lot more nuanced than that, right? You're absolutely right. Okay. The Copper Age was a time of incredible innovation and independent societal development, for instance. In the Iberian Peninsula, you had the Vila Nova de SÃ£o Pedro and Los Millares cultures flourishing with sophisticated copper-working societies. Wow. And this was centuries before the Beaker people came along with bronze technology. So we're talking about well-established, like, copper-based societies. Yeah. Existing long before bronze even entered the picture. Exactly. That's fascinating. They weren't just sitting around waiting for bronze to show up. They were forging their own path. That's so cool. And these societies, they were connected by these surprisingly extensive trade networks. Oh, wow. Researchers have traced copper used in artifacts found in northern Germany and Denmark dating back to 4,000 to 3,300 B.C. Okay. All the way to mines in Serbia. Hold on, so they were trading copper over such vast distances, like, over 7,000 years ago? It is incredible, isn't it? That's incredible. It seems like copper wasn't just a practical resource. No. It was, like, shaping social interactions and driving these long-distance connections across Europe. Yeah. What else can you tell us about these networks? Oh, they were complex, these networks, multifaceted. It wasn't just, like, a straightforward exchange of goods, you know? Right. These trade routes, they actually helped spread ideas, cultural practices, even technologies. Oh, wow. They were like arteries, really, pumping life and innovation throughout all these early societies. So copper wasn't just driving, like, the economic exchange? No. It was weaving together this complex tapestry of, like, cultural interaction. Exactly. I'm beginning to understand just how significant its impact was on shaping these early societies. But I'm curious about, like, the logistics of it all, you know? How exactly were they transporting copper over these long distances? Well, we know that rivers played a huge role. Okay. Boats were most likely the main way to move bulk goods like copper. Makes sense. It's pretty amazing to think about these early traders, you know? Navigating the waterways, building relationships with all the different communities along the way, really contributing to this, like, spread of knowledge and innovation across Europe. It really paints a vivid picture of a dynamic and interconnected world, you know? All thanks to this one humble metal. Yeah. It really makes you wonder, did this whole focus on copper mining trade, did it have any impact on how these societies were structured? Absolutely, yeah. The demand for copper really fueled the development of mining and specialized labor. Okay. You needed skilled miners to get the ore out, craftspeople to shape it, drivers to move it around. Because these weren't just isolated activities. They created new social roles, specialized skills, whole complex economic systems. And did these shifts eventually lead to the rise of early states, you know, organized societies with those, like, centralized power structures? They definitely played a part, yeah. Archaeologists usually classify states as either primary, meaning they kind of developed on their own, or secondary, meaning they were influenced by, you know, already existing state structures. Right. And here's the fascinating thing. The Copper Age, we see the emergence of primary states in a bunch of different places. Okay. Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Egypt. So these early states were essentially built on the foundation laid during the Copper Age. Yeah, pretty much. All the innovations, the trade networks, the specialized labor. All of it. It seems like it all kind of came together to make these more complex forms of social organization possible. Right. That's quite a legacy for a metal we don't often think much about. It is remarkable, yeah. And while we've been mostly talking about tools, weapons, trade, it's important to remember that copper had other uses too. Oh, right. It was super important for pigments, ornaments, even early currency. Oh, yeah, the currency thing. That's really interesting. Right. Didn't the Romans use, like, copper lumps as money? They did. At first, the value was all about the weight of the copper itself. Okay. But over time, the focus shifted to the form and look of the copper. Kind of foreshadowing how modern coins developed. So what started as a simple lump of metal, like, became this symbol of value and exchange. It's fascinating how, you know, societies create meaning around these objects. Yeah. And how those meanings change over time. Absolutely. Makes you wonder, were there any other surprising ways copper was used during this era? Oh, absolutely. Yeah, copper was a really multifaceted material beyond tools, weapons, currency. It had a really important role in art, spirituality. Oh, interesting. Yeah, for example, copper, they used it to make pigments, you know, for painting, decorating. So it wasn't just about practicality? No, not at all. It was also about aesthetics, expressing, like, those cultural beliefs. Exactly. It makes me think, you know, this whole quest for copper, development of these really complex societies, did it have an impact on how humans viewed, like, their relationship with the natural world? That's a great
