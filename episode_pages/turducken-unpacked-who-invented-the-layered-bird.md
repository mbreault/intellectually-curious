## Transcript

All right, so picture this. It's Thanksgiving. You're about to carve the turkey. And suddenly you realize there's more than meets the eye with this bird. Like, a lot more. You've got this culinary mystery, the turducken chicken in a duck. In a turkey, it's like edible Russian nesting dolls, but you know, way tastier. A culinary matryoshka doll, some might say. Exactly. But the real question is, who came up with this crazy delicious idea in the first place? Where did the turducken even come from? We've been digging through articles, historical records, even stumbled upon a whole website dedicated to selling these things. And I imagine everyone and their grandma claims to have invented the turducken. You got that right. But today, we're going deep on three contenders' names you might recognize. We've got Paul Perdomme, the legendary Cajun chef. Then there's Hebert Specialty Meats down in Louisiana. They've got a story to tell. And, oh, just to keep things interesting, we're throwing John Madden into the mix. The football commentator. Now, that's a plot twist. Right. Who knew he was such a foodie? But before we get ahead of ourselves, for anyone listening who's never had the pleasure of encountering a turducken in the wild. In the culinary wild, you could say. Okay, yeah. In the culinary wild, what exactly are we talking about here? Imagine this. You're at the Thanksgiving table about to carve what you think is a perfectly normal turkey. But as your knife goes in, you realize there's something more beneath the surface. Another bird. And another. It's a symphony of poultry, each layer more delicious than the last. You're making me hungry. Okay, so let's start with the man who many consider to be the godfather of the turducken. Chef Paul Perdomme. A true culinary icon. No doubt. He was known for his Cajun and Creole cuisine, rose to fame in the 80s with his New Orleans restaurant, K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen. The place was legendary. And get this, he actually trademarked the name turducken in 1986. Ah, but here's the catch. A trademark doesn't necessarily equal an invention. Just means he had a good lawyer. Or, you know, he saw a golden opportunity and a delicious one at that. That's true. He was a smart businessman, that's for sure. But it does make you wonder. If he trademarked it in 86, was he already serving it at his restaurant before then? Was the turducken his secret weapon, wowing diners for years? Our sources don't say for sure. What they do suggest is that Prudhomme wasn't just trying to create a novelty dish here. He wanted something impressive, something that would be the centerpiece of any buffet or feast. Which makes sense. Those lavish buffets were all the rage back in the 70s and 80s. And what could be more eye-catching, more of a showstopper than this giant multi-bird roast? Exactly. Prudhomme, he understood presentation. And the turducken, with its layers of, what can I say, culinary intrigue, it definitely fits the bill. But it's important to note that stuffing one bird inside another, this wasn't exactly his idea. This technique, it actually has a name. It's called engastration. And it's got a surprisingly long history. Engastration. Now there's a word I haven't heard before. Sounds a little intense for a cooking technique. Right. Sounds like something out of a medieval feast. But trust me, we'll get into the fascinating history of engastration a bit later. For now, let's just say that Prudhomme's genius wasn't necessarily in inventing the technique itself, but in popularizing this specific, and let's be honest, undeniably delicious version of it. So maybe Prudhomme didn't invent the turducken, but he certainly made it famous. Oh. All right, but hold on to your hats, folks, because our turducken journey is just beginning. We're heading deep into Cajun country where another contender enters the ring. That's right. We're off to Maurice, Louisiana, home of Hebert Specialty Meats and their very own turducken tale. And this one has all the ingredients of a classic food origin story. A small-town butcher shop, a customer with a unique request, and a dish that took on a life of its own. We'll dive into all the details after a quick break. We're back in Maurice, Louisiana, home of Hebert Specialty Meats. Now, they claim to have created the first turducken back in 1985, a full year before Prudhomme put his trademark on it. Their story, it all comes down to one customer with, shall we say, a very particular vision. Yeah, I mean, imagine walking into your local butcher and saying, hey, can you debone this chicken and duck and stuff them inside a turkey? Like, were there diagrams involved? Did this customer come with a PowerPoint presentation? Right. Our sources don't specify exactly how that conversation went down. But according to Hebert's, they took on the challenge. Word got around about this culinary masterpiece they'd created, and, well, you know the rest. They were off to the races. It's a good story. A little too good, maybe. Some folks find the timing a little suspicious, like it's almost too perfect to be true. Yeah, I mean, you do have to wonder about those convenient coincidences. But here's the thing. Even if we take that 1985 claim with a grain of salt or maybe a pinch of Cajun seasoning. I like what you did there. There's no denying Hebert's has a long history with the turducken. They're still selling them today, which definitely says something about their dedication to the craft. For sure. And you can't deny that local legend angle. There's something really appealing about that. It gets at the heart of food traditions, you know? How a certain dish becomes part of a community's identity. Absolutely. But we can't stay in Louisiana forever, even if the food is amazing. We've got to talk about the man who brought the turducken to the masses. The one and only John Madden. Ah, yes. The football commentator turned unlikely culinary icon. Now, Madden, he wasn't a chef. But he had a real passion for food. An understatement. This wasn't just a casual, oh, I enjoy a good turducken now and then. This was full-on turducken evangelism. Exactly. He was completely smitten with this thing. And his excitement, it was contagious. Did you know he once brought a turducken into the broadcasting booth on Thanksgiving Day and tarved it up on live TV? Oh, I remember that. It was legendary. When a sports icon is dissecting your culinary creation for millions to see, you know you've made it. But Madden's love for the turducken, it went beyond just a publicity stunt. He had a genuine enthusiasm for it, and people picked up on that. It's a fascinating example of how cultural influence can come from the most unexpected places. I mean, who would have thought a football commentator would end up being a champion for the turducken? He brought it into the mainstream, made it something everyone wanted to try. From serious foodies to your average football fan. He made it a Thanksgiving Day staple for a whole generation. Okay, so we've got Prudhomme, the culinary showman, Hebert's with their charming origin story, and Madden, the unexpected turducken advocate. Everyone wants to claim this multi-layered masterpiece as their own. It makes you wonder, though, are we just scratching the surface here? What do you mean? Well, we've talked about those modern-day figures who helped popularize the turducken. But the idea itself, this whole concept of stuffing birds inside each other, it goes back a lot further than any of them. Remember, engastration. Oh yeah, the bird stuffing technique with the fancy name, so it's more than just a recent fad. Oh, much more. We're talking centuries old. In fact, we found a recipe from a 1913 Spanish cookbook. It's called La Cocina EspaÃ±ola Antigua, which means the ancient Spanish kitchen. And let me tell you, this recipe is something else. Okay, ancient is definitely a word that grabs my attention. What did they unearth back then? This recipe is called Guisado Particular. Describes a dish with 16 birds. 16, all stuffed inside one another. 16! Okay, now that's dedication to the stuffing arts. I can barely handle stuffing one turkey. What kind of birds are we even talking about here? Like, sparrows and robins? I don't think they were stuffing robins. The recipe mentions things like partridges, quails, chickens, even some smaller songbirds. And those are just the layers. The final product was then stuffed into something even bigger, like a goose or a swan. Now that's a feast. It's amazing to think about those culinary traditions that stretch back so far. But, you know, we found something a little closer to home, too. A New Orleans surgeon who apparently had a thing for deboning and stuffing birds. Ah, yes, Dr. Gerald Lanasa. He's become a bit of a legend in New Orleans culinary circles. A surgeon with a passion for poultry. Okay, I'm definitely intrigued. Tell me more about this Dr. Lanasa. Now, the stories about him, they're more word of mouth than anything else passed down through generations of food lovers in New Orleans. But they paint a picture of a man with incredible surgical skills. Skills he used not in the operating room, but in the kitchen. So instead of scalpels, he was wielding poultry shears. Exactly. He was known for being able to debone birds with
