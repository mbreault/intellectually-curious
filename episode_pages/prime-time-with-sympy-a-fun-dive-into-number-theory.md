## Transcript

All right, everybody, buckle up. We're diving headfirst into the wild world of number theory today. Yeah, get ready to explore the fascinating hidden patterns in the fabric of numbers. We'll be using the number theory section from the Simpy documentation as our guide. It's going to be our treasure map today, leading us through all the cool tools and techniques mathematicians use to unlock the mysteries of numbers, so to speak. It's our mission today to make sure you walk away with a good grasp on all these core number theory concepts. And hey, you might just learn some new party tricks for your next trivia night. Exactly, you never know. Okay, so let's kick things off with the essentials. Prime numbers. The building blocks, right. Right. Now, Simpy has this very handy function called primeth. Basically, you give it a number, let's say 10. And it'll spit out the 10th prime number. Which is 29. Exactly. What's really cool about this function, though, is how efficient it is. It uses some pretty clever math. Like what? Like the prime counting function. Just to give you an example, to quickly pinpoint those prime numbers, even when you're dealing with really massive numbers. The prime counting function, huh? Is that like taking a census of all the prime numbers or something? You got it. It tells you how many prime numbers exist up to a specific number. So say you wanted to find the millionth prime number. Okay. Instead of having to check every single number, this prime counting function lets mathematicians estimate where that prime number roughly sits on the number line. Ah, so it's like a shortcut through a giant jumble of numbers. Exactly. And since we're talking about shortcuts, we should probably mention prime gaps, too. Oh yeah, prime gaps. And just so everyone's on the same page, these gaps, they're not really empty spaces. They represent the differences between consecutive prime numbers. And they're actually full of all sorts of little mysteries that have kept mathematicians busy for centuries, trying to figure them out. Like that twin prime conjecture, that one always makes my brain do a few backflips. Right, that's the one that says there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that are only two apart. Like three and five or 11 and 13. Exactly. Seems pretty straightforward at first glance. Yeah. But actually proving it is a completely different story. Yeah, I bet. And it's those deceptively simple questions that make number theory so fascinating. Take Goldbach's conjecture, for instance. It claims that every even number larger than two can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. So like 10 is just three plus seven and 24 would be 11 plus 13. But proving that holds true for every single even number, I can see how that would be a real head scratcher. It's a real challenge. And what's interesting is that both of these conjectures, even after centuries of mathematicians trying to crack the code, they still haven't been proven. Wow. It really highlights that intriguing dance between simplicity and complexity that lies at the very heart of number theory. It's like the more we uncover about numbers, the more we realize just how much more there is to discover. Exactly. And Sympy actually gives us a pretty handy tool to help us break those numbers down and uncover their prime factors. You mean the factor in function? That's the one. It's like having a magnifying glass for integers, allowing you to see all those prime building blocks. I like it. You just input any whole number and bam, this function gives you this neat little dictionary showing you exactly which prime numbers, when multiplied together, will give you back your original number. So it's like reverse engineering numbers, taking them apart to see what they're made of at the most basic level. Exactly. And here's the really cool part. There's this thing called the limit parameter that lets you set a kind of budget for your factorization. A budget. Yeah. Let's say you're only interested in factors below 100, for example. You just set that limit to 100 and the function won't even bother searching for any factors beyond that point. That's got to be super useful, especially when you're working with those mega huge numbers where finding every single prime factor could take forever. For sure. It's all about setting some boundaries for your exploration. Love it. And for those who prefer a more visual approach to understanding things, Sympy also has this visual option built into the function. Oh, nice. It presents the whole factorization in a much more engaging way, making it a lot easier to grasp those relationships between the numbers and their prime factors. Yeah, because who doesn't love a good visual, right? It's like taking those abstract number relationships and turning them into something you can actually see and interact with. Exactly. Now, speaking of relationships, the Sympy documentation also dives into this cool concept called smoothness. Smoothness. Okay, now you've piqued my curiosity. Are we talking about some smooth jazz here or what? Not quite, though I do love a good analogy. In the world of number theory, smoothness refers to the size of the prime factors a number has. Think of it this way. A number that can be broken down into many smaller prime factors, that's considered smoother than a number that has only a few larger prime factors. So it's not really about how smooth a number feels, but more about how easily it breaks down into smaller chunks. You got it. And Sympy actually gives you a way to measure that smoothness with the smoothness prime function. It not only tells you how smooth a number is, but also how smooth its neighbors on the number line are. Its neighbors, how does that work? Well, that's where things get really interesting. Knowing the smoothness of the numbers surrounding a potential factor can actually be incredibly useful, especially for those more advanced factoring techniques. It's a bit like having a map that shows you the lay of the land around a potential factor, helping mathematicians navigate those vast landscapes of numbers a bit more effectively. That's fascinating. So we've explored prime numbers, the gaps between them, and even how to dissect them and see what they're made of. Now, what about those numbers that fit nice and neatly inside other numbers? You're talking about divisors. Divisors, exactly. Those are fascinating characters in the world of number theory. Might seem pretty straightforward at first glance, but trust me... Everyone, there's more to it, isn't there? Oh yeah, there's definitely more to them than meets the eye. So there's more to divisors than meets the eye. I'm all ears. Oh yeah, they're more nuanced than you might think. We've got different types, each with their own unique quirks. Okay, you're making me think of divisors as having different personalities now. Well, we've got the regular divisors. Those are the ones that divide evenly into a number, including one and the number itself. Okay, so for 12, that would be like 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Perfect example. Then we've got the proper divisors. Those are similar, but a little more exclusive. They don't include the number itself. So no 12 in that case. Exactly, just 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Then things get even more interesting with unitary divisors. Unitary divisors are, what makes them stand out? Well, these are the independent types. They don't like to share prime factors with the original number, other than 1, of course. So they want their prime factors all to themselves. Can you give me an example? Let's take 24. Its unitary divisors would be 1 and 24. Because 24, if you break it down, has those prime factors of 2 and 3, right? Yeah, 2 times 2 times 3. Exactly. But 1 and 24, they don't share any of those prime factors, making them the independent unitary divisors in this case. Ah, I see. It's not just about dividing evenly. It's also about the relationship between their prime factors, like a whole hidden layer of complexity. That's it. And then we have the rebels of the divisor world, anti-divisors. Anti-divisors. Okay, I'm really intrigued now. What makes them so rebellious? These are the ones that don't care about dividing cleanly. Instead, they want to leave the biggest remainder possible. The troublemakers. They like to shake things up a bit. For example, if we take the number 10, an anti-divisor would be 3. Because 10 divided by 3 gives you a remainder of 1. Exactly. And you can't get a larger remainder when dividing 10 by any number bigger than 1. Okay, that makes sense. So we've got all these different flavors of divisors. What's the point of classifying them this way? Why does it matter? Ah, that's the key question. You see, these seemingly basic concepts of divisors, especially when we start getting into prime divisors, they have huge implications in different fields, like cryptography. Cryptography, like codes and cybersecurity and all that? Exactly. A lot of the security of our online transactions, it hinges on the fact that factoring large numbers into their prime divisors is a really, really tough computational problem. Wow. So all these different kinds of divisors, they're not just mathematical curiosities. They actually impact our everyday lives. Big time. And that leads us to a pretty cool function that a brilliant mind like Euler was particularly interested in. Euler. Okay, now we're talking. Whenever Euler's name comes up, I know things are about to get fascinating. Right. He came up with what we call Euler's Totient function. Okay. Often represented as, get ready for this. All right, I've got my notes ready. So
