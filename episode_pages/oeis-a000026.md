## Transcript

All right, welcome back everybody to another deep dive into the world of numbers, sequences, all that fun stuff. Today we're going to be looking at mosaic numbers. Okay. And our source for this is always going to be the OEIS, the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. Right. And this one is a pretty cool sequence. I think it's entry A000026. Yeah, that's the one. So we're going to jump into it and take a look and see what we can find out about mosaic numbers. Sounds good. Yeah, so the OEIS starts off giving us the definition of mosaic number. And it says if n product pjk j, then an product pjk j. Okay. Now, you know, you being a mathematician, you probably see prime factorization going on there, right? Absolutely. And that's going to be a big part of what we're talking about today. Yeah, breaking down those numbers into their prime factors. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It's like for finding those building blocks of a number, you know, and then we're going to kind of rearrange them in a specific way to create this mosaic number. Okay, because it's pretty fascinating. So is that what makes it a mosaic number then? That specific rearranging? Yeah. Yeah, you can think of it that way. So like if you take the number, let's say 24, you can break it down into its prime factors, which are 2, 2, 2, and 3. Right. So that's 2 cubed times 3. Okay. Then to get the mosaic number, you multiply each prime by its exponent. So 2 times 3, then times that 3 by its exponent, which is 1. Oh, okay. I see. And you end up with 6 times 3, which is 18. Got it. So 18 would be the mosaic number of 24. That's pretty cool. So I was looking through the entry and it mentions this thing about square-free numbers and their mosaic numbers. Yeah, square-free numbers, remember, those are the numbers that aren't divisible by any perfect square other than 1. Right, right. So like 10 would be square-free because it's 2 times 5. Right. But like 12 wouldn't be because it's divisible by 4. Which is 2 squared. Exactly. So the interesting thing about square-free numbers is that their mosaic number is actually just the number itself. Oh, okay. Like take 10, its mosaic number is also 10. That's interesting. So why is that? Well, it's because all the exponents in the prime factorization of a square-free number are 1. Okay. So when you multiply each prime by its exponent, you're essentially just multiplying it by 1, which doesn't change anything. Gotcha. It's like a little identity trick for square-free numbers. So then how does that play into the whole sequence of mosaic numbers? Well, that's where things start to get a little bit more... A little more interesting. Interesting, yeah. So like you look at the mosaic number sequence, it starts off 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 6, 10, and so on. Hold on, I see it. You see that repetition there? Yeah, the 6 is repeating. Exactly. And that's kind of a clue to how these mosaic numbers work. Like if you look at the numbers 8 and 9, they both have different prime factorizations, right? But their mosaic numbers end up being the same, which is 6. Huh. So that repetition isn't just random? Not at all. It's like a result of how those prime factors and exponents come together. Okay, that's pretty cool. It is, isn't it? So I was looking at the OEIS entry, and it also gives this formula. A-N, A0, 0, 5, 3, 6, 1, N, A0, 0, 7, 9, 4, 7, N. Oh yeah. And I was completely thrown for a loop. Like first of all, what does that even mean? Well, you know how we said the OEIS is kind of like this giant web of interconnectedness? Yeah, definitely. Well, this is like a prime example. So you've got A0, 0, 5, 3, 6, 1, which lists the largest prime factor of each number. Okay. And then you've got A0, 0, 7, 9, 4, 7, which gives you the sum of the exponents in the prime factorization. So it's like looking at the same number in two totally different ways. Exactly. But then somehow the combination of those two things gives you the mosaic number. Yeah, it's pretty wild, right? Yeah, it's mind-blowing. It really shows you how these seemingly different concepts in number theory are actually all connected. I'm starting to see that, yeah. And we'll see later on how this idea of mosaic numbers being like a shadow or a projection. Oh, right. You mentioned that before. Yeah, a projection based on the prime factorization. That'll become a bit clearer as we go along. Okay, so then this entry also mentions something called an asymptotic formula. Right. Some K1. Right. AKC N2. Can you help me understand that? Yeah, so an asymptotic formula tells us about the long-term behavior of something. Okay. In this case, it's talking about the sum of the mosaic numbers. Got it. So basically, as N gets really large, like astronomical large, the sum of the first N mosaic numbers starts behaving like a constant multiplied by N squared. So the bigger the set of numbers, the more predictable their mosaic number sum becomes. Exactly. It's like they settle into some kind of pattern. Yeah, you could think of it that way. Okay, so I'm noticing that the OEIS entry mentions a paper by B. Gordon and M. M. Robertson titled Two Theorems on Mosaics. Right, right. What can you tell us about those theorems? Well, those theorems, they provide some serious mathematical backing for what we've been talking about. The first theorem, it delves into this connection between the divisors of a number and the divisors of its mosaic number. Oh, okay. It's like it shows how these seemingly separate aspects are actually intertwined. Okay, I'm definitely intrigued. So tell me more about this connection between divisors. Okay, well, it can get pretty technical, but the gist is this. If you know the divisors of a number, you can actually say something about the divisors of its mosaic number. Interesting. Like there's a kind of mathematical inheritance happening there. Huh, okay. Yeah, it's pretty fascinating. So even though we started out talking about prime factorization and rearranging those prime factors, there's this whole other thing going on with mosaic numbers and divisors. Absolutely. Okay, so what about the second theorem? Yes, the second theorem deals with something called the average order of the mosaic number function. Average order? Yeah, now imagine this. You've got a room full of people, right? Okay. And you want to find their average height. Right. So you'd add up everyone's height and then divide by the number of people, right? Makes sense. Well, the second theorem is kind of similar, but instead of people and heights, we're dealing with numbers and their mosaic numbers. Oh, I see. So the theorem gives us a formula to calculate the average value of the mosaic numbers for like the first N positive integers. Got it. It's kind of like finding the average height of the mosaic numbers in that set of numbers. Exactly. And what's really cool is that as N gets incredibly large, this average value approaches a specific constant. So even though mosaic numbers themselves can be kind of unpredictable, their average over a large set becomes predictable. Yeah, it's another example of this underlying order that we find within mosaic numbers. That's pretty amazing. It is, isn't it? Yeah, it's really cool. So, you know, earlier we spent some time talking about the repetition of the number six in the mosaic number sequence. And it was really interesting, but as we get deeper into these theorems and the connections to divisors and average values, it almost feels like that repetition was just a little sideshow. It's true. The repetition of six is more of a surface-level curiosity. Okay. It highlights the role of prime factorization, but those theorems by Gordon and Robertson really take us much deeper into the heart of the theory. Right, and we also can't forget that formula connecting mosaic numbers to sequences A005361 and A007947. Absolutely. That was mind-blowing. Yeah, that's another great example of how different areas of number theory are all intertwined. Yeah, it really is. It's like, you know, you pull on one thread and it unravels this whole tapestry of connections. I'm starting to see that, yeah. The OEIS is really more than just a catalog of sequences. It's a roadmap to this vast network of mathematical relationships. Okay, well, on that note, let's take a quick break, and when we come back, we'll delve even deeper into those fascinating connections and the implications of those theorems. Sounds good. All right, we'll be right back. Welcome back, everybody. We're in the middle of our deep dive into mosaic numbers. Yeah. And, you know, before the break, we were talking about how mosaic numbers are like a shadow of the original number. I'm kind of stuck on that. Yeah. I think I need you to kind of unpack that a bit more for me. Okay, sure. Like, what exactly do we mean by shadow in this
