## Description

Take a tour of the island of stabilityâ€”the predicted region where some superheavy nuclei could enjoy unexpectedly long lifetimes. Weâ€™ll trace the nuclear shell model, magic numbers, and the difference between spherical and deformed nuclei, with case studies like flerovium (element 114) and hassium-270. And weâ€™ll peek at how researchers create, observe, and study these rare elements in the lab with techniques like radioactive ion beams and multi-nucleon transfer reactionsâ€”and what all of it could mean for our understanding of matter itself.

## Transcript

All right, so imagine this, right? A place on the periodic table where elements can stick around for years, maybe even eons. Eons, wow. Yeah, we're talking about the island of stability. Right. And it's had physicists kind of going crazy for decades. For a long time. It's a fascinating concept. It really is. And you sent over some really interesting research on it. Absolutely. Happy to share it. So let's do a deep dive into how this theoretical island could totally change how we think about, like, matter itself. Yeah, I mean, the island of stability is basically this region where some super heavy elements, those that are, you know, beyond uranium, they're predicted to have way, way longer half-lives than their neighbors on the periodic table. You see, most super heavy elements decay almost immediately in fractions of a second. Right, super unstable. Yeah, exactly. But this island suggests that some might hang around for a lot longer, all thanks to this idea of magic numbers. Okay, magic numbers. Now, I vaguely remember from chemistry class that stability has something to do with how protons and neutrons are arranged in the nucleus. You got it. You're on the right track. The stability of a nucleus really all comes down to its binding energy. Binding energy. It's essentially a measure of how tightly those protons and neutrons are held together in the nucleus. Okay. So higher binding energy, more stable nucleus. Pretty straightforward, right? Makes sense. And, you know, think of it like a Jenga tower. Okay, I like that. Too many blocks, too few blocks. You put it on the wrong spot and the whole thing, you know, gets wobbly. Yeah, it's going to fall apart. Exactly. So are you saying that as we go up the periodic table to those heavier elements, things get a bit, well, unstable? Yeah, exactly. Because you're cramming more and more protons and neutrons into the nucleus, and so things get a little shaky. Yeah. I mean, I know that elements beyond lead, which is element 82, they tend to be super unstable. That's right. The binding energy generally goes down as we go to heavier elements. And that leads to them, you know, falling apart more easily. But the island of stability theory, it throws a bit of a curveball. It suggests there are, like, exceptions to this trend. The idea is that specific numbers of protons and neutrons, magic numbers. Right. They create these super stable configurations within the nucleus. So these magic numbers, they act like what, like a stabilizing force? Yeah, exactly. Like a secret ingredient for super heavy elements. Okay, so I'm seeing in my notes here something about electron shells. Right. How does that tie in? Good point. So it's kind of similar to the way electrons fill those shells in an atom, right? Yeah. When a shell is full, the atom is more stable. Same idea here. Just swap electrons for protons and neutrons. Got it. So full shells, happy nucleus, stable element. Pretty neat. That's the gist of it. I'm also seeing that physicists Maria Goeppert-Mayer and Johannes Hans Daniel Jensen. Oh yeah, pioneers. They won a Nobel Prize for their work on the nuclear shell model back in the 60s. That's right, 1963. And their research, that really laid the groundwork for this whole island of stability idea, didn't it? Oh, absolutely. It's foundational. Their work, along with later stuff by, you know, William Myers and Wadisaw Schuytecki, it all kind of led to this prediction. And what was that prediction? That element 114. Element 114. Florovium. Florovium, okay. With a neutron number of 184. 184 neutrons. That could be a particularly stable spot. Right on that island. So Florovium, this is kind of like a landmark element in the whole search for the island of stability. Yeah, exactly. I mean, there's a good reason for that. Okay. Back in 1998, scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research over in Russia, they actually managed to create Florovium. Wow. Synthesized it and its properties. Well, it kind of shook up the physics world. Okay, I'm intrigued. What was so special about Florovium? Well, think about it. Super heavy elements, they usually decay super fast, right? Right, fractions of a second. But Florovium, it stuck around for, get this, 30.4 seconds. 30 seconds? That's like a lifetime for a super heavy element. I know, right? It's an eternity. And that's why it was such a big deal. It really pointed to these stabilizing magic number effects that had been predicted. You know, all that work by Mayer and Jensen and others, it was all coming together. That's incredible. So Florovium wasn't just another element on the periodic table. Nope. It was a crucial piece of evidence for the island of stability. Exactly. A real game changer. And the excitement, it just kept building. Scientists have found even heavier elements since then, getting closer and closer to that magic neutron number of 184. 184, yeah. For example, there's this isotope, 285CN. Just eight more neutrons than its counterpart, 277CN. Eight more. And boom, its half-life is almost 100,000 times longer. Talk about a difference. That is wild. Just a handful of extra neutrons. It really shows you the power of those extra neutrons, especially when you get close to those magic numbers. It's like they're the glue holding these super heavy elements together. Yeah, you could say that. But hold on. We've been talking about atomic nuclei as if they're these neat little spheres. Is that always the case? Ah, you've hit on a really important point. Not all nuclei are perfect spheres. What? Really? Yeah. In fact, some of them, especially in the super heavy realm, they can be deformed. Like, imagine football shapes or pears or, you know, all sorts of wonky shapes. Okay, so we've got wonky nuclei. We do. And it throws another wrench into our understanding of the island of stability. So how do these deformed nuclei change things? Well, they actually lead to different magic numbers. Different magic numbers. Yep. Totally new possibilities for stability in the super heavy elements. Wow, so it's not just one island of stability. Right. It's more like an archipelago of stability with spherical islands and deformed islands. You got it. And the discovery of hassium-270, that really solidified this idea. It's believed to be doubly magic. That means it has magic numbers of both protons and neutrons. Okay. But it's deformed. So hassium-270 is like the rebel of the super heavy world, breaking all the rules. Yeah, you could say that. Yeah. And its half-life is surprisingly long, nine seconds, which just adds more weight to the idea that these deformed nuclei can hold the key to new islands of stability. This is blowing my mind. It's like the more we learn, the more we realize we don't know. But if we do find elements with these super long half-lives on these islands, how would they actually decay? It can't be a peaceful process, right? You're right. It's definitely not peaceful. Super heavy elements, they've got a few tricks up their sleeve when it comes to decay. You've got your classic alpha decay. Alpha decay. Where the nucleus ejects an alpha particle, basically a helium nucleus. Right. Then there's spontaneous fission where the nucleus just splits apart. Yikes. Sounds kind of violent. Yeah, it's pretty intense. But I bet it gets even crazier with the really, really heavy elements. Oh, absolutely. For the heaviest of the heavy, you can even have clustered decay. Cluster decay, okay. That's where the nucleus ejects a whole chunk of itself, like a cluster of protons and neutrons, not just a simple alpha particle. Wow. Atomic fireworks. Exactly. So even if these island elements are long-lived, they don't go quietly. Definitely not. But here's a question that's been bugging me. If these island elements do exist, and they have these super long half-lives, could we actually find them in nature? That's a great question, and it gets a bit complicated. You see how elements are created in stars through a process called the R process. Okay. It doesn't really favor creating these super heavy nuclei. So it's not impossible, but... It's like trying to build a skyscraper with toothpicks. Not the best building material. Yeah. The conditions just aren't right. So while these island elements might exist naturally, they'd be incredibly rare. Finding them would be like finding a needle in a haystack. A very, very large haystack. Okay, so probably not something I'm going to stumble upon on my next nature hike. Probably not. But the fact that we can create these elements in labs, even if it's for a short time, it's pretty amazing. It really speaks to human ingenuity. It really is mind-blowing. So if we want to keep exploring this island of stability and maybe find those elements with lifetimes longer than billions of years... Billions of years. We're going to need some brilliant minds and some pretty incredible technology. Absolutely. And that takes us to the next chapter of our deep dive. The challenges, the ingenious solutions, and the whole process of creating these super heavy elements. I think you sent me some research on stuff like radioactive ion beams and multi-nucleon transfer reactions. Oh, yeah. Right. Definitely sounds pretty cutting edge. It is. It's fascinating stuff. The radioactive ion beams, multi-nucleon transfer reactions. Those sound pretty intense.
