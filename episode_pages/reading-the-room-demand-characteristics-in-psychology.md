## Description

Join us as we unpack demand characteristicsâ€”the subtle cues in research that nudge participants' behavior. Weâ€™ll break down common signals, the roles participants adopt (the good participant, the screw-you, the apprehensive), and why they matter for internal and external validity. Weâ€™ll also explore practical strategies scientists use to minimize bias and keep findings trustworthy.

## Transcript

All right, welcome back to The Deep Dive. For all of our listeners who love getting into the nitty gritty of, well, pretty much anything, but especially when it comes to like the human mind and how it works, you're in for a treat because today we are going deep on something called demand characteristics. And before you tune out thinking this is going to be some boring research jargon, stick with us. Because this is like getting a peek behind the curtain in psychology research, you know? Understanding how these demand characteristics can actually shape the outcomes of studies is really pretty fascinating. I couldn't agree more. And it's a real pleasure to be here to kind of unpack this with you all as we explore, you know, the science of human behavior. We've got to be aware of all these little intricacies, right? And especially this kind of interplay between the people doing the research and the people participating in it. And that's where these demand characteristics really come into play. So true. So let's break it down for everyone listening. What exactly are we talking about when we say demand characteristics? Okay, so in the simplest terms, you can think of demand characteristics as like these little hints or clues that sort of pop up within a research study. And these hints, they might lead the participants to start forming ideas about what the researchers are actually trying to find out. Oh, interesting. And once they've got that interpretation in their head, well, they might start to change their behavior, even subconsciously, to fit that interpretation. So it's like they're trying to solve the puzzle of the experiment. Yes, exactly. Like trying to figure out, okay, what's the real purpose here? Right, right. And the thing is, these cues, these demand characteristics, they're like these sneaky little variables that the researchers didn't intend to include, but they can really mess things up because they can influence how people act in ways that weren't part of the original plan. Wow, sneaky is right. It really is. I mean, it makes sense, though, when you think about it. I mean, you're in this unfamiliar situation. Yeah. You know, you're trying to figure out what's expected of you. It's natural to start looking for those little clues. Absolutely. And I think the work of Martin Orn really highlighted this, you know? Years ago, he was one of the first to really emphasize how the participants in research aren't just these passive subjects. They are actively trying to interpret the situation they're in. Oh, totally. So, okay, so we know participants are looking for clues and maybe even changing their behavior, but why? What's the motivation behind that? Well, I think a lot of it boils down to this idea that participants, they know they're being watched, right? They're being observed, their responses are being recorded, and that can create this natural desire to perform well, to kind of, you know, meet those perceived expectations, even if nobody's directly telling them what those expectations are. So they're thinking like, ooh, how do they want me to say here? Exactly. Or how do I come across as the, you know, the good participant or the helpful one? It's like when you were back in school taking a test. You know, you're trying to figure out what the teacher's really asking, even if the question seems straightforward. Exactly. You're trying to read between the lines, and in a research setting, this can lead to people giving answers that they think are more socially acceptable or maybe acting in a way that they think will please the experimenter. Yeah. Even if it means not being totally genuine. And as we see from what we've been reading, we can't totally eliminate that, you know, the participants are always going to interpret the situation, but at least by understanding how they're doing it, we can start to account for it. Absolutely. So let's get into the specifics then. What are some of the, like, the common giveaways, those demand characteristics that might tip participants off about what a study is really about? Okay, so let's think about a few different sources. Sometimes it can be as simple as, you know, rumors or information about the study that's already circulating. Maybe participants have talked to people who've already been through the study or details have leaked out, maybe accurate, maybe not. But either way, that can really shape their expectations. Yeah, like knowing the ending of a movie before you watch it, it just totally changes the experience. Exactly. So that's one thing, but what else? Well, believe it or not, even the physical environment of the laboratory itself can provide these subtle cues. Really? Yeah. Think about it. If you walk into a lab and it's all, like, clinical and sterile, you might assume the study has something to do with illness or dysfunction. That makes sense. Whereas if it's a more relaxed, informal setting, you might get a totally different impression. So the room itself is like whispering secrets. Yes, exactly. And then there's the communication from the experimenter. Right, right. Which can be explicit, like in the instructions they give, or it can be these tiny little nonverbal cues, like a certain tone of voice. Oh, wow. A smile, a raised eyebrow, you know, in response to a participant's answer. So even something as subtle as a facial expression can influence how someone participates? We are incredibly tuned in to those kinds of signals, often without even realizing it. That is wild. It is. And that leads us to these different roles that participants might take on. Yes, I wanted to ask you about that. Yeah. Because the idea that participants might sort of adopt a specific role during an experiment is fascinating. It is. And researchers like Weber and Cook, they've actually identified a few common ones. Okay, so break it down for us. So first, you've got what they call the good participant role, sometimes called the please you effect. The please you effect. I like that. These are the people who are actively trying to figure out what the researcher's hypothesis is. And then they try to behave in a way that confirms it. So they're like the eager helpers? Yes, exactly. Even though they don't know what they're helping with. Precisely. And then on the flip side, you have the negative participant role or the screw you effect. Oh, wow. These folks, they also try to figure out the hypothesis, but their goal is totally different. They want to undermine the study. So they're like the rebels of the research world. Exactly. The contrarians. And you've got the faithful participant. They're the ones who really want to follow the instructions perfectly. Yeah. And just behave naturally, even if they have some inkling of what the study is about. So they're like the ideal participant, right? In theory, yes. But even they can be swayed by their own interpretations. Right. And lastly, there's the apprehensive participant. And these individuals are mostly worried about how the experimenter is judging them. So they're all about making a good impression. Exactly. More so than maybe giving completely accurate responses. Hmm. That's interesting. So can you give us an example of how these different roles might actually play out in a real study? Sure. Let's say we're doing a study on whether people are more likely to donate to a charity after watching a video about its work. Got it. Now imagine our good participant, they might suspect the study is trying to encourage donations, and they might consciously decide to donate, even if they wouldn't have otherwise. So they're trying to help prove the hypothesis. Exactly. Now the negative participant, with the same suspicion, might deliberately choose not to donate. Just to mess with the results. Exactly. Wow. The apprehensive participant might donate a small amount just because they think that's what's expected. Yeah, like the socially acceptable thing to do. Right. And then you've got your faithful participant who'll try to watch the video and make a genuine decision based on their reaction. But even then, their decision might be subconsciously influenced. It might be. Yeah, it's really hard to completely separate yourself from those expectations. Right, because even if you're trying to be objective, you're still in this environment that's shaping your perception. Exactly. So how do these demand characteristics actually impact the validity of the research? Well, the main concern is something called internal validity. Okay, and internal validity, for those of us who aren't scientists, is? It basically means how sure can we be that the changes we see in the outcome, the thing we're measuring, were actually caused by the thing we changed? Right. Not by some other sneaky variable. But if participants are changing their behavior based on what they think the study's about, well, then it gets really hard to know what's really driving the results. It's like trying to figure out if a new fertilizer makes your plants grow better when you also gave them more sunlight. And water at the same time. Exactly. It's a great analogy. You can't isolate the cause and effect. You can't. And on top of internal validity, demand characteristics can also mess with external validity. And this is? External validity is all about whether the findings from a study can be applied to other simulations, other groups of people, you know, the real world. Got it. So if participants are acting a certain way because of those artificial cues in the lab, well, their behavior might not actually reflect how they'd act in real life. So it's almost like the act of being in a study changes how people behave. Precisely. And that's a big problem. So it's a huge challenge for researchers to figure out how to navigate these demand characteristics. It really is. And researchers have come up with some pretty clever strategies to try and minimize or at least account for their influence. I'm all ears. Lay it on us. Okay. Well, one common approach is deception. Deception. Okay. Elaborate. So basically it involves intentionally misleading the participants about the true purpose of the study. Like giving them a cover story
