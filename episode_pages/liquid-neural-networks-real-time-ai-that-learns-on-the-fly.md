## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone. Today we're doing a deep dive into something I think you'll find really fascinating. Liquid neural networks, or LNNs for short. And, you know, given your background in computer science, I know you're always super interested in the cutting edge of AI. So I think this is right up your alley. Yeah, very cool. So LNNs, they're kind of pushing the boundaries of what we think of as a neural network. Because instead of being static, like the traditional neural networks that we're used to, these systems adapt in real time. Wow. And they draw inspiration from the way biological neurons work. Interesting. So very, very different. Yeah, so not just processing data in a fixed way, but actually changing and evolving as new information comes in. Exactly. Like, that's the power of LNNs. That's what makes them so intriguing. Yeah, that's super cool. I mean, that sounds pretty revolutionary. Yeah. Where did this all begin? I mean, was there kind of a single aha moment that led to this whole field? So the foundational research can be traced back to MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. MIT, of course. So CSL. Right. And this was around 2020. Okay. And Reem Hosseini and his team, they were really the pioneers in this area. Makes sense. And they were looking at, you know, they were looking at how biological neurons function. And, you know, they're constantly adjusting to new inputs. And they thought, why can't we build AI that does the same? Hmm. That's fascinating. Yeah. So that's where the liquid part comes in. Yeah. It's about mimicking that fluidity of our own brains. And I can imagine as someone who, you know, spends a lot of time coding, trying to replicate that has got to be incredibly complex. Absolutely. How do they actually pull that off? So it all comes down to how LNNs actually process information. Okay. So traditional neural networks, right, they kind of analyze data in these discrete chunks. Right. But LNNs use what's called time continuous processing. So they're constantly analyzing data as it unfolds. Okay. In real time. Interesting. So it makes them very responsive to changes. Yeah. I'm starting to get the picture. But how does this actually translate into real world advantages? Right. I mean, where do they really shine compared to, you know, the kind of traditional neural networks that I'm used to working with? So one key area is efficiency. Okay. And when we say efficiency, we're talking about, you know, traditional networks can be huge. They require a lot of computing power. Right. Tons of resources. But LNNs are remarkably compact. Wow. They can run on devices as small as a Raspberry Pi. Really? So that opens up a whole world of possibilities. Yeah, especially as we move towards more edge computing and AI on smaller devices. Because that's a game changer. It is. And I know from my own experience, you know, trying to optimize code for limited resources is always a challenge. For sure. But beyond efficiency, what other benefits do LNNs bring to the table? Well, one of the things that's always bothered me about traditional AI is this whole black box problem. Right. You know, it can be so difficult to understand how a network reaches a decision. Right. It makes it really hard to trust these systems. Totally. And especially in like safety critical situations. Absolutely. Yeah. So how do LNNs approach this differently? Well, because they're smaller. Okay. And they tend to focus on the essential elements of a task. Uh-huh. They offer a much greater degree of transparency. So you can actually trace the reasoning behind their actions. So you can actually see why they made a certain decision. Yeah, exactly. Oh, that's fantastic. It makes them much easier to understand and crucially to debug. That's music to my ears. Right. Being able to pinpoint, you know, where an LNN went wrong instead of being totally lost in this maze of nodes and connections. Exactly. Yeah, this transparency. I mean, it could be a game changer. Absolutely. Especially for someone like you who's deep in the world of coding and development. Yeah, for sure. I mean, think about it. You're developing a self-driving car with an LNN. You could potentially see exactly how the system is responding to different road conditions and make adjustments as needed. So you have this level of insight that you just don't get. Exactly. With the black box. It's just not possible with traditional models. Right. That's one of the areas where LNNs really have the potential to shine. It sounds like they could really be a major step forward in making AI more reliable and understandable. Absolutely. But I'm sure there are challenges too, right? Of course. I mean, no technology is perfect. LNNs are still a developing field. Uh-huh. And there are definitely some limitations that we need to consider. Okay, like what? Well, one of the biggest hurdles right now is the type of data they require. Okay. LNNs, they really thrive on time series data. Hmm. Like, you know, sensor readings or videos. They're not as effective when you're working with static data. So like images or text. Exactly. That's interesting because a lot of the data sets that I work with are kind of a mix of different data types. Right. So it sounds like LNNs might not be like a one-size-fits-all solution. Right. But I wonder, are there ways to maybe combine the strengths of LNNs with other approaches? That's a really interesting question. And actually, researchers are already exploring that, ways to create these hybrid systems. Okay. That leverage the dynamic adaptability of LNNs along with, say, the pattern recognition capabilities of other architectures. So you could have a system that uses like convolutional neural networks to extract features from images and then feeds that information into an LNN for real-time decision making. That's the idea. Sounds like you'd be combining the best of both worlds. Exactly. That's really cool. And it's not just about combining existing architectures. I think the principles behind LNNs could actually inspire entirely new AI models. Wow. We're really just scratching the surface of what's possible with this liquid approach to computation. I mean, that's what I love about computer science. There's always this new frontier to explore. Absolutely. It sounds like LNNs are just the beginning of a major shift in the way we think about and design AI. Absolutely. A fundamental shift. Yeah. If we want to create truly intelligent machines, we need to move away from these rigid, predefined models and really embrace that fluidity and adaptability that characterize biological intelligence. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. I mean, this deep dive has really opened my eyes to the potential of LNNs. I'm glad to hear it. But before we wrap up, I want to go back to something you mentioned earlier about the limitations. Okay. You said that one of the biggest challenges is their reliance on time series data. Right. Could you expand on that a bit more? Sure. So LNNs are designed to process data that unfolds over time, like a video feed or a stream of sensor readings. Okay. This allows them to capture that dynamic nature of the information and adapt their responses accordingly. Right. However, this also means that they're not well suited for tasks that involve static data, like image classification or natural language processing. So for example, if I were building a system to recognize different types of objects in a still image, an LNN wouldn't be the best choice. Exactly. In that case, a convolutional neural network or CNN would be a much more appropriate choice. Okay. Because CNNs are specifically designed for image analysis. Got it. LNNs excel in scenarios where the data is constantly changing and the system needs to adapt in real time. So it's all about choosing the right tool for the job. Exactly. But even though LNNs have this limitation with static data, I'm still really intrigued by their potential. You mentioned earlier that they could inspire the development of entirely new AI models. What kind of possibilities do you envision? Well, one area that's particularly exciting to me is the development of AI systems that can learn and adapt in a more continuous and dynamic way. So we're talking about AI that's not just processing information, but actually evolving its internal structure over time. It's a radical departure from traditional AI, which relies on these fixed models that are trained on static data sets. With an LNN-inspired approach, we could create AI systems that are more flexible, more robust, and ultimately more intelligent. That's a powerful thought. It is. I'm suddenly picturing a future where AI systems are not just tools, but partners that can learn and grow alongside us. That's the end. It's a future that's full of possibilities. Absolutely. And while there are certainly challenges to overcome, it sounds like LNNs represent a major step in the right direction. I believe so. This has been really eye-opening. Good. I'm glad. But, you know, putting aside all this amazing potential for the future, let's bring it back down to Earth for a second. Okay. What advice would you give to someone like me, you know, a computer scientist, who's intrigued by this technology and wants to, you know, start exploring it? I think the most important thing is to just stay curious and keep experimenting. Okay. Don't be afraid to try new things and see how LNNs can be applied to different problems. So it's not just about waiting for the perfect LNN to appear. Right. It's about getting our hands dirty and seeing what we can create with what we have now. Absolutely. And as you experiment, you know, remember to leverage those computer science skills. Okay. Think about how you can optimize, you know, LNN architectures, develop new
