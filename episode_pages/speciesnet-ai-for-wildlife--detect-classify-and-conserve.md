## Transcript

Okay, so today we're diving into some really cool computer science stuff. This Google project, SpeciesNet. Have you heard about this one? Yeah, it's pretty fascinating. Basically, they're using AI to analyze wildlife images from camera traps. You know, those cameras set up in the wild to capture animal activity. Yeah, exactly. So much data though, right? Like imagine trying to sort through thousands or even millions of images to identify all those animals. Oh, it would be a nightmare for ecologists. Trying to do that manually would just be incredibly time consuming. So that's where SpeciesNet comes in. It automates that whole process using AI. So it's like AI to the rescue for wildlife conservation. Pretty much. And the really clever part is that they use an ensemble approach. Ensemble approach. Hmm. So what does that mean? Well, think of it like a team of experts, each specialized in a different aspect of image analysis. So there's a detector model that first figures out if there's an animal, a human, or a vehicle in the image. Okay, so it's not just blindly trying to identify every blob in the image. It's first filtering out the non-animal stuff. Exactly. And then if an animal is detected, a classifier model comes into play to determine the species. Ah, so it's a two-step process. First detect, then classify. Makes sense. Yep. And that's where things get even more interesting because SpeciesNet also takes location into account. Oh, right. That makes sense. Yeah. An animal found in Africa is probably not going to show up in a photo from North America. Exactly. So they use something called geofencing to rule out unlikely predictions based on where the image was taken. So it's like having a virtual map of animal distributions around the world. Precisely. And if the model isn't totally sure about a specific species, it can use what's called taxonomic roll-ups to make a more general prediction. Oh, I see. So instead of saying lion, it might just say big cat if the evidence isn't strong enough. Right. It's a way of being more cautious and avoiding overly specific claims when the AI isn't totally confident. That's pretty clever. Now, for our listeners who are into the nitty gritty of computer science, can you tell us a bit more about the technology behind these AI models? Sure. So the detector component of SpeciesNet uses a model called Megadetector, which is based on a deep learning architecture known as convolutional neural networks. Convolutional neural networks. Those are the ones that are particularly good at analyzing visual data, right? Exactly. They're kind of the workhorse of image recognition these days. The classifier, on the other hand, uses a different type of model, either an always crop or a full image model. Okay, so what's the difference between those two? Well, always crop models require a bounding box around the animal, which is provided by the detector. They then focus solely on that cropped region to analyze the animal's features in detail. So it's like zooming in on the animal to get a closer look. Yeah, you could think of it that way. Full image models, on the other hand, analyze the entire image, potentially picking up on contextual clues from the surrounding environment. Ah, so they each have their own strengths and weaknesses depending on the situation. Exactly. And that's why the ensemble approach is so powerful. By combining the results of these different models, SpeciesNet can make more robust and accurate predictions. It's like the wisdom of the crowd, but for AI. Uh-huh. Good analogy. Okay, so let's say a researcher wants to use SpeciesNet. Is this something they can run on their own computer, or is it a Google-only thing? Nope, it's open source. Anyone can use it. It's available as a Python package installable via pip. That's great. So walk us through it. How would you actually use this package? You'd start by installing the SpeciesNet package using pip. Then you'd use the main script runmodel.py to run the analysis. You can feed it various inputs like a folder of images, individual image files, or even JSON files listing images and their metadata. Ah, metadata. That's where you can include information like location, which ties into the whole geofencing feature we were talking about. Exactly. The more information you provide, the more accurate and insightful the results can be. So I can run the whole SpeciesNet pipeline at once, but it sounds like there's also flexibility to run things step by step. Yep. You can choose to run only the detector or only the classifier, depending on your needs. That's pretty flexible. Very cool. It's like having a Swiss Army knife of AI tools for wildlife image analysis. Now, I know a lot of our listeners are into the tech side of things. Can you talk a little bit about the technical details of running SpeciesNet, particularly for those who are familiar with GPUs and their advantages for faster processing? Sure thing. So SpeciesNet can indeed utilize GPUs, which can really speed things up, especially with large datasets. However, there's a slight quirk when it comes to running it on Windows. A quirk. Tell me more. I love quirks. Well, the detector component, MegaDetector, uses PyTorch, which works seamlessly with GPUs on Windows. Okay, so far so good. However, the classifier is based on TensorFlow, which needs to be run within Windows Subsystem for Linux or WSL on Windows machines to utilize GPUs. Ah, so a little bit of a workaround for Windows users. Right. But it allows them to harness the power of their GPU for faster classification. Good tip for our Windows users out there. Okay. Let's shift gears a bit and talk about a real-world application. Imagine we have a camera trap image from the Amazon rainforest. What happens when we feed that into SpeciesNet? Okay, so picture this. We have an image from the Amazon. The detector goes to work scanning the image and identifying a potential animal. Let's say the classifier initially predicts it as a jaguar. Sounds promising, but I'm guessing there's more to the story. Right, because SpeciesNet doesn't stop there. It takes into account the location of the image using its built-in geofencing knowledge. So let's say the specific type of jaguar predicted doesn't actually inhabit that particular region of the Amazon. Ah, so that's where geofencing comes in to refine the predictions. Yep, SpeciesNet might then adjust its prediction, perhaps suggesting a more general category like jaguarundi, a smaller wild cat found in that region. Or if the confidence level is still too low, it might simply say wild cat. So it's saying, I'm pretty sure there's a cat in this picture, but I need more information to be certain about the exact species. Exactly. That level of caution is really important for scientific applications where accuracy is crucial. This has been a fascinating look into the technology behind SpeciesNet. It's amazing to see how AI is being used to tackle real-world problems like wildlife conservation. I agree. It's a great example of the power of computer science to make a positive impact. And speaking of impact, in the next part of our deep dive, we'll explore how SpeciesNet is actually being used in the field to revolutionize conservation efforts. So stay tuned. So, you know, we've talked about all the technical stuff about SpeciesNet, but what really gets me excited is how it's actually being used to help conservation efforts. Right, it's one thing to have a fancy AI tool, but it's another thing entirely to actually use it to make a real difference for wildlife. Exactly. And one of the biggest challenges in conservation has always been simply knowing where animals are and how their populations are changing. Yeah, you can't really protect a species if you don't know where to find it or if its numbers are going down. Right. And traditionally, monitoring wildlife populations involved so much manual work. Researchers had to set up camera traps, collect the images, and then spend hours and hours just looking through them trying to identify and count animals. That sounds incredibly tedious and not to mention prone to human error. I can definitely see how AI could streamline that whole process. And that's exactly what SpeciesNet does. By automating the image analysis, it frees up researchers to focus on, you know, actually designing and implementing conservation strategies. It's like having a tireless, super-efficient assistant that can handle the grunt work, leaving the humans to focus on the bigger picture. Perfect analogy. And because SpeciesNet is so much faster than manual analysis, researchers can get near real-time insights into what's happening out in the field. Near real-time? Yeah. That sounds like a huge advantage. Yeah. What kind of impact does that have on conservation efforts? Well, it means that if a species is suddenly disappearing from an area, conservationists can potentially intervene much more quickly. It gives them a chance to address the problem before it's too late. That's really cool. So we've talked about tracking populations, but can SpeciesNet do more than just count animals? Can it tell us anything about their behavior? Absolutely. SpeciesNet isn't just about counting heads. It's also about trying to understand animal behavior. By analyzing patterns in the images, researchers can learn about things like animal movement patterns, their interactions with each other, and even how they respond to changes in their environment. Wow. So it's like being able to observe the secret lives of animals without actually disturbing them. Exactly. And that's really important because camera traps are already a non-invasive way to study wildlife. And SpeciesNet takes that to another level by minimizing the need for human intervention. I can see how this would be especially beneficial for researchers studying elusive or endangered species where minimizing disturbance is crucial. Right. And there are other interesting applications too. For example, SpeciesNet can be used to identify individual animals based on their unique markings. Oh, wow. That's like giving each animal a digital fingerprint. How does that work? Well, animals often have distinctive patterns on their fur or scales, and SpeciesNet can
