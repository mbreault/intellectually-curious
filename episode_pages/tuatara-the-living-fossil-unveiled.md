## Description

Join us for a deep dive into the tuatara, the reptile that isnâ€™t a lizard and isnâ€™t from the same time as dinosaursâ€”it's a living fossil. We explore its beaked jaw, unchanging teeth, a third eye, and other ancient traits that reveal how evolution rewrites the rulebook.

## Transcript

Welcome everybody to another deep dive. This time we're going on a journey to meet a creature that's practically a celebrity in the reptile world, even if most people haven't even heard of it. The tuatara. And what a fascinating creature it is. So before we get too deep into this, you know, we like to provide some context for our listeners. For this deep dive, we're going to be using excerpts from the tuatara Wikipedia page, which is, I mean, it's a treasure trove of information on these guys. It really is. So have you ever come across a creature that just makes you question everything you thought you knew about the animal kingdom? Oh, absolutely. And the tuatara is a perfect example of that. They might look like something you'd see in a nature documentary about lizards, but I assure you, they're in a category all their own. Yeah. You know, looking at a picture, my first thought was lizard. So like, why isn't it classified as one? What's the deal? Well, you're not alone. Early scientists made the same mistake. Back in 1831, they only had a tuatara skull to work with. Based on some, shall we say, superficial resemblances, they lumped it in with the lizards. It wasn't until 1867 when a zoologist named A.C.L.G. Gunther took a closer look that the scientific community realized how unique the tuatara really is. So what did this Gunther guy just have, like a super powered magnifying glass? What did he see that others missed? He noticed some key differences, particularly in the skull, which ultimately led to a whole new classification, Rhynchocephalia. Rhynchocephalia. Okay, I'm going to need you to break that down for me. It translates to beaked. Beaked. All right, now we're talking. What's so special about their skull? Well, for starters, they have this thing called a complete lower temporal bar. Imagine a lizard skull. Now picture an opening right behind the eye socket. That's the lower temporal fenestra. Most lizards have it, but not our friend the tuatara. They've got this bony bar that completely closes off that opening. A bony bar? Is that like a common thing in the reptile world? Not really. It's actually a characteristic more common in ancient reptiles. It's like finding a vintage car part in a brand new model. It provides a fascinating glimpse into their evolutionary past. So this little bony bar is like a time capsule hinting at their ancestors from millions of years ago. Precisely. And we're just getting started. What about those teeth? Have you ever heard of a reptile that needs to adjust its diet as it gets older because its teeth don't change? Wait, what? Are you telling me tuataras have like a midlife crisis diet change because their teeth just give up? Something like that. Their teeth are fascinating. They're fused to the jawbone and have this beak-like tip on the upper jaw. And here's the kicker. They don't get replaced throughout their entire life. Whoa. So no trips to the reptile dentist for these guys. But seriously, how do they survive with the same set of teeth their entire lives? That doesn't sound very practical. You're right. It's not practical, which is why the tuatara has adapted. Younger tuataras with their sharper teeth can handle tougher prey like beetles. But as they get older, with those teeth not getting any younger, they have to switch to a softer menu. Earthworms, slugs, that sort of thing. Wow. That's incredible. Evolution really does find a way, huh? But speaking of evolution, I've read that their jaws don't just move up and down like ours. How does that whole jaw sliding thing work? It's a unique mechanism. Unlike our jaws, which primarily move up and down, the tuatara's lower jaw slides forward when it eats. This sliding motion, combined with the way their upper and lower teeth interlock, creates a seriously powerful shearing force. They can cut through some surprisingly tough materials like chitin and even bone. Chitin, like what? Crab shells? Exactly. They're equipped to handle a diverse menu, even with those unchanging teeth. That's incredible. Their skull is like a multi-tool designed for survival. But that's not all, right? They have other adaptations too, don't they? Oh, absolutely. And that's what makes them so fascinating to study. They're like a walking, breathing puzzle from the past, and each piece we uncover just leads to more questions. Well, on that note, I think we're going to have to take a quick break. But don't worry, we'll be right back to dive deeper into the world of the tuatara. So last time, we left off talking about the tuatara's incredible skull and those teeth that just don't quit. But now it's time to dive into something even weirder. Even weirder than teeth that never get replaced? I'm intrigued. Oh yeah, get ready for this, because this is where we get into the truly weird and wonderful world of tuatara's senses. Get this. These guys have a third eye. It's one of the things that makes them so fascinating. A third eye? Come on, seriously, is that even possible? It sounds like something out of science fiction, but it's true. The tuatara's third eye is the real deal. It's called a parietal eye, and it's located right on top of their head. Okay, so hold on. It's on top of their head. Like, what can they actually see with it? Can they, like, see through things? I'm afraid not. It's not x-ray vision or anything quite that dramatic. It's more of a light sensor than a fully functional eye. It's not winning any staring contests anytime soon. But it can distinguish between light and dark. Okay, so maybe not superpowers, but still, pretty cool. What does it actually do, then, if it's not for, you know, seeing in the traditional sense? Scientists believe it plays a crucial role in regulating the tuatara's circadian rhythm. It basically acts like their internal clock, helping them know when to sleep, when to be active, and, you know, just generally live their best tuatara life. So like a built-in alarm clock. Exactly. And there's even more to it. Some scientists theorize it might even help them detect seasonal changes, which is pretty important for any animal that relies so heavily on its environment. And get this, some scientists even speculate it might play a role in thermoregulation. Whoa. Talk about multitasking. So they have three eyes to help them navigate their world, but what about ears? Can they even hear anything? Yes, they can hear, but not in the same way we do. Their hearing is actually pretty different from ours and a lot of other reptiles. Okay, so no cute little ear flaps. You got it. No ear flaps here. They don't have external ears like we do. Instead, their hearing mechanism relies on picking up vibrations, particularly within a specific frequency range. So kind of like how some snakes sense vibrations in the ground. Exactly. It's a different way of experiencing sound, but it's effective for their environment. Wow, so they're tuned into a whole different sound wave. Fascinating. So we've talked about sight, hearing. What about smell? How's their sense of smell? Well, their sense of smell is particularly interesting. Unlike what you might expect, it's actually more similar to birds than to their reptile relatives. Birds? Seriously? Now I'm really confused. What do birds have to do with a reptile's sense of smell? Well, birds, like the tuatara, actually rely heavily on their sense of smell. They have a surprisingly large number of these things called odorant receptors, which are what allow them to detect different scents. Huh, so they're sniffing out their dinner just like a hawk eyeing its prey. That's amazing. I never would have guessed that. It all comes down to adaptation. Their senses have evolved over millions of years to make them perfectly suited to their environment. It really makes you wonder what else we might discover about these amazing creatures. But speaking of adaptations, we've got to talk about their bodies. I mean, their senses are one thing, but the source material mentioned something about their spine being shaped like an hourglass. An hourglass? I know, right? You don't often think of spines as having a fashionable figure, but the tuatara's vertebrae, those are the bones that make up the spine, have this unique hourglass shape. That's so strange. Why an hourglass? What's the evolutionary advantage of that? And how on earth did scientists even figure that out? Great questions. It's actually a characteristic more common in fish and some amphibians, believe it or not. We don't have all the answers yet, but it likely has to do with the way they move and support their bodies. It's just another one of those fascinating quirks that makes the tuatara so unique. So it's like they're rocking a vintage design. That's incredible. But the hourglass spine isn't their only skeletal secret, is it? There was something in the source material about something called gastrolia too, right? What are those? You've been doing your research, yes. Gastrolia are these rib-like bones that are located in the abdomen. They're considered a pretty ancient trait, actually, found in some other reptiles and even in extinct animals like dinosaurs. Dinosaurs. OK, now you're speaking my language. Tell me more about this dinosaur connection. Well, picture those early land vertebrates, right? As they were making that transition from water to land, they needed a little extra support and protection. These skeletal features, like gastrolia, along with other bony
