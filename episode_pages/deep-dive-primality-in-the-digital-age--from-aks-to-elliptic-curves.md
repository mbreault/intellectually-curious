## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. Today we're really getting into something foundational, something you probably don't think about much, but it underpins, well, so much of our digital lives. Yeah, we're talking about how we actually know if a truly massive number is prime. Exactly. And why should you care? Because, honestly, confirming primality for these huge numbers is absolutely critical for the encryption securing your online world. Things like RSA encryption, they need these giant primes. So finding them means you need a way to test them, a reliable way. No kidding. So for you listening, think of this as the hidden engine behind your secure connections. And we've got a great set of sources today, some Wikipedia basics, a pretty detailed student paper, even some serious research on formally verifying these tests. Right. So we're going to use these sources to explore how primality testing works, really focus in on one of the big methods used today, elliptic curve primality proving, ECPP, and understand why it's important and roughly how it operates. Okay, let's start with the basic problem. Small numbers, right? Like, say, 17. Checking if it's prime is easy. Yeah, super easy. You just try dividing by 2, 3. You only need to check up to the square root, which is, what, just over 4 for 17? Right. And since none divided evenly, boom, it's prime. That's trial division, brute force. Simple. Works fine for small numbers. But here's the thing. The numbers in cryptography aren't 17. Not even close. No way. We're talking hundreds of digits for things like RSA keys. And for the people actively searching for new record primes, it can be thousands, maybe even over 20,000 digits. Wow. Okay, so that brute force method. It just completely falls apart. The sources, they show these graphs. And the runtime, I mean, it just explodes. It goes up incredibly fast as the numbers get bigger. One source called it horrendously slow. And that's putting it mildly. It increases far too quickly. It's just not feasible for crypto-sized numbers, let alone the record breakers. You need something totally different. Okay, so brute force is out. The sources say there are basically two main types of modern tests, deterministic and probabilistic. What's the deal there? It really boils down to the kind of answer you get. A deterministic test. It gives you a solid 100% certain answer. Yes, prime or composite. No ambiguity. Okay, clear cut. So probabilistic must mean there's some chance involved. Exactly. Probabilistic tests are often much faster. But there's a trade-off. They can definitively prove a number is composite, no problem there. What if it passes the test? If it passes the test, then it's probably prime. There's still a chance, usually a very, very small chance, that it's actually composite but just happened to, well, fool the test. A false positive. The sources call that a pseudoprime, right? A composite number that looks prime to the test. That's the one. And yeah, passing a test but still being composite, that sounds a bit risky for something critical, like an encryption key. You'd think? Well, yes and no. Tests like Miller-Rabin are super common because they're fast. It's based on Fermat's little theorem, uses random numbers. Random bases, yeah. Right. And the trick is you run it multiple times with the different random bases. Each run lowers the probability of error significantly. You can get the error chance down so low it's considered negligible for many practical uses. But never zero certainty. Never technically zero. Then there's Bailey-PSW, which the sources mention. It's stronger, combines Miller-Rabin with another test, a Lucas test. And that one's pretty solid. Extremely solid in practice. The sources note it's actually proven deterministic for numbers up to 2 to the 64, which is huge. And nobody's ever found a pseudoprime for it, even for larger numbers. So while technically probabilistic, beyond that point it's incredibly reliable. Okay, so probabilistic, fast, often good enough, especially Bailey-PSW. But for absolute ironclad proof, you need deterministic. And besides the slow theoretical ones like Wilson's theorem, the sources point to ECPP and APRCL as the practical choices. Those are the main ones used today, yes. And then there's AKS, which was this huge theoretical breakthrough. Ah, yes, AKS, Agrawal, Kayal, Saxena, 2002. What made that so special? It was a landmark achievement. The sources really emphasize this. It was the very first algorithm for primality testing that ticked all the boxes at once. All the boxes. Meaning? Meaning it works for any number, so it's general. Its runtime is polynomial in the number of digits, that's the theoretical definition of efficient. It's deterministic, giving a guaranteed answer. And crucially, it's unconditionally correct. Unconditionally. As in, doesn't rely on other unproven math. Exactly. Some earlier deterministic ideas like Miller's test only worked if you assumed something like the generalized Riemann hypothesis was true. AKS didn't need any unproven assumptions. So before AKS, you were stuck. Either probabilistic or deterministic, but only for special numbers, like Mersenne primes or Fermat primes, or deterministic but conditional on some big unsolved math problem. Pretty much, yeah. AKS just cut through all that. It showed fundamentally that primality testing is in the complexity class P. It's theoretically easy, solvable efficiently. What's the idea behind it? Briefly. Well, it involves checking a specific kind of polynomial equation, a congruence, that generalizes Fermat's little theorem. But, you know, while it was revolutionary for theory... The sources say it's not actually the fastest in practice. Right. Even with improvements made since 2002 for the really big numbers we use today, other methods, especially ECPP, tend to be faster in real-world implementations. AKS proved it could be done efficiently in theory, but it didn't deliver the most efficient practical tool. Okay, so AKS, theoretical giant, proves primes is NP, but not the day-to-day workhorse. That brings us back to ECPP, elliptic curve primality proving. The sources seem to really highlight this one for practical deterministic testing. Absolutely. Along with APRCL, it's one of the two main methods used when you absolutely need a deterministic proof for large numbers. And why ECPP often gets the nod? Well, partly speed. Implementations of ECPP just tend to run faster than APRCL on the kinds of numbers people are testing. But maybe the biggest advantage, especially for finding and verifying those enormous record-breaking primes, is the primality certificate. Primality certificate. Okay, that sounds important. What exactly is that? So, think about it. Running one of these deterministic tests on a massive number takes a lot of computer time. It's expensive. Right. Once you've done all that work and found out, yes, it's prime, you don't want someone else to have to repeat the entire computation just to be sure. Makes sense. A primality certificate is basically extra data that the ECPP algorithm spits out along with the prime result. This data acts as a compact proof. And the key thing is verifying the certificate is way, way faster than generating it in the first place. Ah, okay. So, I run ECPP. It tells me my giant number N is prime, and it gives me the certificate. Then I can give N and the certificate to you. And I can run a much quicker check using the certificate to confirm independently that, yes, N is definitely prime according to the rules ECPP uses. Got it. Like getting the answer key with the worked out solution? Kind of, yeah. And for those huge primes, tens of thousands of digits, the sources mention numbers over 20,000 digits verified this way. This is absolutely essential. It allows the result to be shared and trusted without everyone needing a supercomputer for weeks. That's huge for collaborative efforts or just keeping track of known large primes. Okay, so ECPP is fast in practice, gives certificates. Any downsides? The sources mention something about its theoretical time complexity. Yeah, that's the slight catch from a theoretical standpoint. Unlike AKS, which has that proven polynomial time guarantee, we don't actually know the strict worst case time complexity for ECPP. It hasn't been proven to be polynomial time in all cases. Oh, so it could potentially be slow in some weird cases? Theoretically, maybe. But in practice, it performs incredibly well. Empirically, it seems to run around O log N to the power of 5-ish, which is really efficient for the numbers involved. And they are using it for record primes. One source mentioned a prime over 57,000 digits proved with ECPP software called Primo as of May 2023. So practically, it works great. Okay, the big one then. How does it actually work? What are elliptic curves doing in a primality test? Seems like a jump from just number theory. It is a jump. It's based on an idea similar to an older test, the Pocklington criterion. Pocklington uses properties of numbers and powers modulo N, the number you're testing. It leverages the group structure of multiplication modulo N. ECPP does something analogous, but instead of using the group of numbers modulo N, it uses the group formed by points on a specially chosen elliptic curve where the curve's coordinates are considered modulo N. Points on the curve form a group. You can add them. You can. There's a defined way to add two points on an elliptic curve to get a third point on the curve. It's geometric, but it follows group rules, associativity, identity element inverses.
