## Transcript

Welcome back to the Deep Dive. This is our science corner podcast series. Really for anyone who's curious about science, the amateur scientists among us. Great to be here. Today we're diving into something I find pretty fascinating. The science behind the Mujoko fruit fly model and how it's used for reinforcement learning tasks. Yes, it's really remarkable work. A collaboration, actually, between Google DeepMind and the Janelia Research Campus. Exactly. And our sources, well, they give us a great window into this. Our plan today is to give you a, let's say, a concise but solid introduction. And highlight why it's so exciting, both for biology and maybe even for tech advancements down the line. Okay, so let's start with the model itself. The sources talk about Flybody. What exactly is that? Right, Flybody is essentially a highly detailed anatomical model of the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Okay, Drosophila. And it's built from Mujoko. What's Mujoko? Ah, Mujoko is a physics simulator. Think of it as a virtual world where we can apply the laws of physics, gravity, air resistance, contact forces, that sort of thing. So you put the Flybody model into this Mujoko world. Precisely. And because Flybody is so anatomically detailed, the way it interacts with those physics, well, it's designed to be very biologically realistic. It's crucial for understanding movement. Got it. So it's not just a 3D graphic. It actually simulates the physics acting on the fly's body. And you can actually watch this. Oh, absolutely. The sources mention you can load the model file. It's called fruitfly.xml into Mujoko's viewer, simulate it, and just see it. That's cool. Yeah, and the accessibility is key. You can interact with it using Python code. They even give simple examples like make the fly take a random action and see what happens, render an image. Right, I saw that. It lowers the barrier to entry, doesn't it? Definitely. Plus, they provide tutorial notebooks. There's even a CoLab version you can run in your web browser. So handy. And example notebooks showing flight simulations, walking, even these vision-guided tasks using reinforcement learning. Okay, perfect segue. Reinforcement learning, or RL. For listeners, that's the type of machine learning where an agent learns by trial and error, getting rewards or penalties. That's the one. So why is this detailed fly model such a good platform for RL? What's the connection? Well, RL gives us this computational way to study how behaviors can just emerge from interaction. You put the virtual fly in a simulated situation with a goal. Like flying straight. Like flying straight or avoiding something. And you use RL algorithms to train it. The fly sort of learns the task itself. It's not explicitly programmed step by step. Which might be closer to how real animals learn or evolve behaviors, right? That's the hope, yes. It allows us to explore those principles. The sources give some really neat examples. Flight imitation is one. The model learns to follow flight paths from real flies. Exactly. It tries to match the real fly's center of mass position and its body orientation over time. How does it control the wings for that? It must be complex. It is. They use what's called a policy network. You can think of that as the high-level brain making decisions. Okay. And that works with a wingbeat pattern generator that handles the detailed muscle commands for flapping. So one decides where to go. The other figures out how to flap to get there. Wow. That sounds like hierarchy we see in biology. It hints at it, certainly. Then there are the vision-guided tasks. Flying over bumps or through a trench using only visual input. Yes. And these are particularly interesting because the fly model has to learn to interpret its visual senses to figure out, say, its altitude or position. And if it crashes? Episode over. The simulation stops. It's a strong penalty pushing the learning towards safe navigation strategies just based on sight. It's learning to see and react. And it's not just flight, right? Walking imitation, walking on a ball. That's right. The walking tasks explore legged locomotion. The walk on a ball one, even if the fly might be tethered in the simulation, really pushes the boundaries of balance and fine motor control. Fascinating. Now, training these RL agents. The source mentioned distributed training using things like Ray and DMPO. Sounds computationally heavy. Oh, it is. Training these complex policies for a model with, well, many moving parts takes a lot of exploration. You need to try countless actions. So distributed RL just speeds that up. Massively. It lets them run loads of simulations at the same time across many processors or machines. You gather much more experience much faster. Makes sense. There was also this idea of controller reuse. A flight controller trained for imitation could be adapted for navigation. Yes, and that's a really exciting finding. It suggests that maybe biological brains do something similar. How so? Well, instead of learning every single behavior from scratch, perhaps fundamental skills like basic flight control can be adapted or built upon for more complex tasks like navigating by sight. Like reusing building blocks. Exactly. Are we seeing a hint that biology might reuse these motor primitives? It's a compelling question raised by this work. The anatomical detail keeps coming up. It's obviously central. Why is that level of detail so important? Because the physics depend on it. To get realistic interactions, how the air affects the wings, how the legs touch the ground, you need an accurate body structure. Right. The shape and mass distribution matter. Immensely. And that realistic foundation allows for more complex, more biologically plausible behaviors to emerge during the RL training. So how is the movement actually driven in the simulation? They mention actuators. Actuators are like the virtual muscles. They apply forces or torques. You might have force-based actuators for the wings generating torque. To flap them. Right. Or position-based actuators that directly set the angle of, say, a leg joint. And the complexity there. The walking task has a 59-dimensional action space. That's huge. It is. Controlling all the leg segments, body joints, even simulating foot adhesion. Flight is simpler, relatively speaking, with a 12-dimensional action space. It reflects the different demands. And what about the timing? Physics steps versus control steps. Ah, yeah. The physics engine needs to run really fast, tiny steps to be accurate. But the control policy, the brain, doesn't usually need to send new commands that frequently. So it sends commands less often. Typically, yes. There's a ratio. Maybe the physics runs 10 steps for every one control step. It's more efficient. And it mirrors how biological control often works on slightly slower timescales than raw physics. Okay. And briefly, inverse kinematics. How does that fit in? That's more of a utility tool. It helps researchers pose the model. If you want the fly to start in a specific posture, inverse kinematics calculates the joint angles needed. Useful for setup or analysis, then? Exactly. Setting initial conditions or comparing simulated poses to real fly data. Now let's connect this back to real flies. One source mentioned experienced male fruit flies actually changed their courtship dance to be more efficient. A great example of real-world behavioral adaptation. So how does this simulation work? Help us understand that kind of thing. Well, this is where the model becomes a powerful tool for investigation. You could potentially simulate courtship, reward efficiency, and see what kinds of control strategies or learning rules emerge in the virtual fly. Trying to figure out the underlying mechanism. Precisely. It lets us test hypotheses about neural circuits or learning rules that are hard to probe directly in the real fly brain during complex behaviors. And it helps that the flight imitation uses real fly trajectories as the target, right? Absolutely crucial. It grounds the simulation. The model isn't just learning a way to fly. It's learning a way that's consistent with how real flies do fly. Makes the comparison much more meaningful. So putting it all together. We've got this incredibly detailed virtual fly. Anatomically accurate. In a realistic physics simulation. Yep, Mujoko. And we're using sophisticated machine learning RL to teach it complex behaviors based sometimes on real-world data. That sums it up beautifully. It's a powerful combination for exploring insect behavior, biomechanics, and even the principles of learning and control. The potential seems enormous. Not just for understanding biology. No, definitely not. Think about robotics. Building small, agile robots that can navigate cluttered spaces using limited sensors. This work could offer huge inspiration. And AI more broadly, perhaps, in understanding embodied intelligence. For sure. It really does make you wonder, doesn't it? How these detailed simulations could accelerate discovery, not just in neuroscience, but robotics too. And what comes next? Could we model other organisms this way? Maybe even more complex ones? What could we learn about intelligence, about movement, maybe even about ourselves by studying these quote-unquote simpler systems in such incredible detail? Those are the big questions driving this field. It's a really exciting time for this kind of research. Absolutely. Well, for everyone listening, if you want to explore this further, we really recommend checking out the links in the research papers on the Mujoco fruit fly model. It's quite the deep dive.
