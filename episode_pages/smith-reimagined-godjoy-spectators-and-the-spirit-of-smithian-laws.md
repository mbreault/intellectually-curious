## Description

A deep dive into Daniel Klein's The Spirit of Smithian Laws, reframing Adam Smith as a subtle moral philosopher rather than a mere economist. We trace the impartial spectator (Godjoy), the organon of sympathy, and Klein's spiral of non-foundationalismâ€”how virtue arises in dialogue, relationship, and evolving understanding. We also situate Smith within the late-18th/early-19th-century shift that flattened nuance, and ask what this 'spirit' can teach about open friendships and living a more thoughtful life today.

## Transcript

Okay, let's unpack this. Today we're doing a deep dive into Daniel Klein's book, The Spirit of Smithian Laws. And our mission isn't just Adam Smith, the economist. We're really trying to get at Smith, the moral philosopher. Exactly, the way he actually thought. Right, what Klein calls the bag itself. So yeah, expect a more subtle Smith, maybe looking at his allegotheistic side, and these ideas like beholderism and the spiral. Yeah, and what's really fascinating right off the bat is this impartial spectator idea. The man within the breast? Yeah. A conscience. That's the one people know, but Klein argues it's, well, it's more than just your conscience. It's like a representative. A representative of what? Of a higher, genuinely impartial spectator. Klein often calls it Godjoy. Godjoy, so like an ultimate watcher. Kind of. Imagine this ultimate beholder, super intelligent, super benevolent, and that's influencing how we even understand virtue. Okay, that's a big shift from just supply and demand Smith. So how does that idea, this sort of higher spectator, shape his whole moral thinking? Well, that's where Klein's idea of Smith's organon comes in. Organon, like a tool or a system. Yeah, exactly. His kind of systematic principle. It basically says every moral feeling we have, even the ones we don't notice, it all ties back to sympathy, feeling with some other being. He uses allegory, you know, like saying, good actions please this Godjoy. It helps us get this complex moral plexus, as Klein puts it. It's like a web. A web of connections. Yeah, and this whole spirit, this idea of cooperating with something higher, that's the bedrock of his virtue ethics, according to Klein. It's intuitive. Right. That brings up that classic philosophical nod, the is and the ought. How do we get from what is to what should be? Klein definitely tackles that. He sort of pushes back against a really rigid is-ought gap. How so? He suggests our oughts, our duties, they're really about what we owe, maybe, or what we've been, like, schooled to believe through society, through interaction. It's not just a logical jump. Schooled to believe. And that ties right into this concept Klein calls the spiral. The spiral. Yeah, it's key to non-foundationalism. The idea is our understanding, moral or factual, isn't like building on solid ground step by step. More like circling upward. Exactly. It's evolving. Facts influence how we see things. How we see things influences what facts we look for. It's this continuous loop, always refining. It's dynamic. Okay, I like that. And, you know, speaking of things being subtle, this is really interesting. Smith's famous invisible hand. Klein points out it's, like, intentionally right in the physical center of Smith's big books. Deliberate placement. And Klein connects that back to the highest impartial spectator, too. It's an example of Smith's esotericism. Yes, those deeper, maybe hidden meanings for the careful reader. Right. And maybe that's why his big moral book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, kind of faded, fell into oblivion around 1800. It was too subtle. That's definitely part of Klein's argument. You connect it to the bigger picture around 1800 and you see this huge cultural shift happening. What kind of shift? Well, that nuanced commercial humanism Smith was part of, it started getting flattened. Discourse became less subtle. Things got put into boxes. Yeah. Like, economics here, morality over there. Precisely. Separate sciences, less appreciation for things like irony or, you know, the hidden meanings. So Smith's really intricate moral ideas, leaning on allegory and this non-foundational spiral... It just didn't fit the new mood. Exactly. People weren't looking for that kind of holistic thinking. And we lost touch with his ideas on circumstantiality. Circumstantiality, meaning... Meaning his big principles aren't rigid laws. They only really hold true under certain conditions, you know? And he stressed that real moral judgment, real upward vitality growth, virtue that needs... These what? Frank and open friendships. Real human connection. Wow. Okay, so this deep dive really paints a very different picture of Adam Smith. Much more complex, spiritual even, than a usual caricature. Absolutely. And for you, the listener, it means seeing Smith's spirit not just as economics, but as this deep moral framework. Something that pushes us to reflect on ourselves, right? How we look to that impartial spectator. Yeah, and to build virtue through real connections, through understanding each other. Maybe then, if we embrace that spirit, that deeper understanding, we can navigate our own complicated times a bit better. And maybe champion those frank and open friendships he thought were so vital. So what really stands out to you about this spirit of Smithian laws?
