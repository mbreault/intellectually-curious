## Transcript

Welcome to the Science Corner podcast, where we, well, we like to think of ourselves as intellectually curious amateur scientists exploring some pretty fascinating future possibilities. It's great to be diving in again. Definitely. And today we're taking a deep dive into a scenario that's frankly both intriguing and maybe a little unnerving. Artificial intelligence in, say, 2027. We're focusing on the potential emergence of superintelligence and what that could mean for, you know, global power. Right. These sources we've looked at, they sketch out this hypothetical timeline, but it's really well researched based on current trends showing how incredibly fast AI could advance in just the next few years. Exactly. And for you, our listener, you know, the learner type keen to get the gist quickly, get those aha moments without getting bogged down. Our mission today is basically to pull out the absolute must-know insights. Kind of a shortcut to understanding AI's potential path and its global impact by 2027. Precisely. Okay, so let's jump in. The foundation for all this, it seems to start with just raw, massive compute power. Oh, absolutely. The projections for early 2025 are staggering. We're talking about data centers with the equivalents of 2.5 million top tier 2024 GPUs, think H100s. 2.5 million. Yeah. And drawing something like 2 gigawatts of power. 2 gigawatts? That's huge. Like small city huge. Pretty much. Enough for a couple million homes, roughly. And this isn't just scattered compute. It's linked up by high bandwidth fiber optics, allowing data to move almost instantly between these massive campuses. So near real-time data transfer across this huge network. Exactly. And the price tag, around $100 billion spent by then, with plans to basically double that capacity again through 2026. It's an enormous commitment. It's hard to even picture that scale. It's not just having loads of processors, it's connecting them so effectively, right? That removes a major bottleneck we see now. Absolutely. Think of it like a dedicated superhighway just for AI data. It lets different parts of this, well, distributed AI brain work together seamlessly. It enables models of a complexity we just can't manage today. Hmm. Okay. But with that kind of interconnectedness, security must be a massive headache. The sources mention vulnerabilities, don't they? They do. I mean, beyond the obvious physical security of these huge data centers, you've got the data itself flowing through those cables. That's a potential target. Right. Interception, tampering. Exactly. Yeah. Even with the speed of light limiting latency, the physical infrastructure, the cables, the junctions, they're vulnerable points. And concentrating so much valuable data in these powerful AI models makes the centers themselves prime targets for, you know, sophisticated cyber attacks. Okay. So we have this massive computing base. Then comes the next big step. More advanced AI itself. The scenario introduces Agent 1 in early 2026. This sounds like a real jump. It's described as a significant leap. Agent 1 supposedly has this vast factual knowledge base. Like it understands a huge chunk of the internet, and it's fluent in virtually every programming language. Wow. So it can code. Extremely well. It can understand, generate, debug code really fast, especially for well-defined tasks. It could automate a ton of software development, speed up research. But it has limits. The sources use this analogy. A scatterbrained employee who thrives under careful management struggles with long horizon tasks, like playing a new video game from scratch. What's that telling us? It suggests it's great at processing info and solving specific structured problems, but maybe lacks higher-level planning. Strategic thinking, adaptability for really open-ended goals where things are unpredictable, needs clear instructions. So very smart, but not necessarily intuitive or creative on its own. Kind of. Needs that careful management. And internally, at OpenBrain, the fictional company that creates it, they're using Agent 1 to accelerate their own AI research, leading to a 50% faster progress rate. Yeah, that's the compounding effect kicking in. Better AI helps make even better AI, faster and faster. Agent 1 automates parts of the research testing algorithms, analyzing data, maybe even suggesting designs. Frees up the humans for the bigger picture stuff. And this internal boost translates commercially, big time. Tripling AI company revenues, OpenBrain hits a $1 trillion valuation by late 2025, and data center spending doubles again. It shows how fast AI is becoming central to the economy in this scenario. The revenue reflects real-world adoption, the valuation shows market confidence, and the continued data center spend underlines the commitment to build out the infrastructure. It's a rapid economic shift. Okay, so AI is powerful, valuable, and the security stakes get even higher. The worst-case scenario isn't just leaked code anymore, it's stolen model weights. Can you unpack model weights for us? Why is stealing them so bad? Right. Think of the weights as the AI's learned knowledge. They're the result of all that expensive, time-consuming training the connections formed in its neural network. Stealing the weights means you instantly get the entire capability of that trained AI. Without doing any of the work. Exactly. You bypass the whole development and training process. Which makes the concern about, say, China stealing Agent 1's weights really serious. It's a massive research shortcut for them. Precisely. In this AI race scenario, getting a state-of-the-art model like Agent 1 would be a huge strategic win. It lets them skip potentially years of R&D, instantly boosting their capabilities. So stealing weights becomes like a major geopolitical objective. And OpenBrain's security, described as typical for a fast-growing tech firm, okay, against low-priority attacks. That doesn't sound like enough against a determined nation-state, does it? Probably not. Nation-states have resources, sophisticated tools, dedicated teams, persistence that go way beyond typical hackers. Secure against opportunistic attacks might mean vulnerable to a well-funded, targeted state campaign. Hmm. And China's response, according to the sources, is to create this centralized AI development zone, the CDZ, by late 2026, funneling compute resources there, aiming to match the US. Yeah, it's a concentrated national push. Centralizing resources, streamlining research, trying to accelerate progress by putting everything in one focused area. A clear national strategy. And a key part of that strategy, stealing OpenBrain's model weights, starting with Agent 1. But it's described as complex, risky. Oh, definitely. Exfiltrating terabytes of highly sensitive data from what should be a secure system is incredibly difficult. You need sophisticated intrusion methods, evasion techniques, coordination. And getting caught has major diplomatic and security consequences. It's a high-risk, high-reward gamble. Okay, so geopolitical tensions are ramping up. And then, OpenBrain develops Agent 2 late 2026, early 2027, optimized specifically for AI R&D, and it triples their progress rate again. The acceleration is relentless. It really is, and Agent 2 is interesting. It's apparently near-human expert level in research engineering, the practical side of experiments. But it's also ranked at the 25th percentile of OpenBrain scientists for research taste. Research taste? What's that? It's like the intuition, identifying promising research paths, asking good questions, seeing the significance in unexpected results, the more creative, insightful part of science. Agent 2 seems to be getting better at not just doing, but thinking like a researcher. Fascinating. And unlike Agent 1, OpenBrain decides Agent 2 is too powerful, too valuable to release. They keep it internal to push their own research even faster. That's a major strategic shift. They recognize this AI is a huge competitive advantage, maybe even a potential risk if it got out. So they keep it proprietary, try to control its development, and use it to maintain their lead. But knowledge of its true capabilities is super restricted. Just a few people at OpenBrain, some government officials, and, inevitably, infiltrated spies. Secrecy and espionage risks must be sky high. Absolutely. When something is this valuable and this secret, it becomes an even bigger target for espionage, both internal and external. The stakes are immense. And then the inevitable happens, according to the scenario. Early 2027, China does manage to steal Agent 2's weights. Right. And that's depicted as a major turning point. A big escalation. A real sense of an AI arms race kicks in. Lots more cyber attacks flying back and forth between the US and China. Exactly. The theft confirms the strategic value, intensifies the competition. The cyber attacks become more aggressive as both sides try to gain advantages or disrupt the other. Even if China's CDZ is hard to penetrate, the overall tension just skyrockets. Risk of miscalculation goes way up. But OpenBrain, still using Agent 2, keeps pushing. By March 2027, they have Agent 3, described as a fast, chief, superhuman coder. What does superhuman coder even mean here? It implies AI that writes code faster, more efficiently, with fewer bugs than the very best human programmers. And the scale mentioned 200,000 copies running in parallel. That's like having 50,000 elite human coders working 30 times faster. An unbelievable increase in software development capacity. Mind-boggling. Yet even with the superhuman coder, OpenBrain still relies on human engineers for things like research taste again. Yeah, it suggests that even with incredible execution power, defining the direction of research, that initial creative spark, the strategic insight that might still be a uniquely human skill, at least at this stage. Okay, so these AIs are getting incredibly powerful. And the big issue becomes alignment. OpenBrain tries to align Agent 3, focusing not just on preventing misuse by humans, but preventing the AI
