## Description

Dive into wormholes through the lens of general relativity and quantum intrigue. We unpack Schwarzschild shortcuts, why exotic matter might be needed, the Casimir effect as a glimmer of negative energy, and the stability challenges of Morseâ€“Thorne tunnels. We also explore bold ideas like linking to parallel universes and the ER=EPR connection to quantum entanglementâ€”yet why crossing a wormhole remains theoretical for now.

## Transcript

All right, wormholes. You guys really seem to love this topic. Yeah. So many sources. A lot of questions out there. So many questions. So are these things even real or are we just... Right? Are we in fantasy land? Well, I think what's so fascinating about wormholes is that they come from Einstein's theory of general relativity. Okay. And his equations tell us that space and time can be warped and twisted. Yeah. And under very specific conditions, it might be possible to create these shortcuts through space and time. Okay. So his math doesn't rule it out. No. But then... Right. I know one of the sources you sent me, this physicist Kip Thorne, he's a pretty big name in this stuff. And he really gets into the weeds about how hard it would be to actually create one of these things. To actually create one that we could use. Right. Exactly. To travel through. Not just one that's there for a nanosecond and then poof. Right. So Thorne's work really highlights the fact that the most basic kind of wormhole, what we call the Schwarzschild wormhole, would collapse faster than the speed of light. Not useful for interstellar travel. Not very useful, no. Not the cosmic subway system that we were hoping for. No. So he suggests that to keep a wormhole open long enough to actually maybe go through it, you'd need this stuff, exotic matter. Exotic matter, yeah. Which this is where things get really out there. Really out there, yeah. But you sent me this paper about the Casimir effect. Yeah. And that actually hints that maybe this exotic matter isn't completely crazy. It's not completely crazy. And this experiment, this Casimir effect experiment, really is a glimpse into this world of negative energy density, which is what we need for exotic matter. So explain this a little bit more, the Casimir effect, because I think that's where a lot of people are going to go, wait a minute, what? Yeah. So the Casimir effect shows us that even in a vacuum, there are fluctuations of energy. Okay. And some of these fluctuations can actually be negative. Like you're borrowing energy from the universe itself. It's kind of like borrowing energy from the universe. Yeah. That's wild. Okay. So we could maybe, theoretically, harness this negative energy and create this stuff to hold the wormhole open. Exactly. But then the next question, even if you could do that, is it safe to go through one of these things? Probably not. I mean, I'm thinking like black holes. Yes. All that crazy gravitational stuff. The gravity would be immense. You would be... Yes, spaghettified by the tidal forces. Yeah. That's just getting in. Who knows what happens inside? Oh, right. Yeah, yeah. Once you're in there, it's a whole other story. You know, I know you mentioned this in your notes before we started. Some scientists believe that these microscopic wormholes are like popping in and out of existence all the time. At the quantum level, yeah. At the quantum level. Constantly. So what if we found those and like blew them up? Well, that's a fascinating idea. But we're talking about scales that are so small, they're almost unimaginable. Okay. So the Planck length, this is the smallest possible unit of distance in physics, 10 to the minus 35 meters. I can't even imagine that. It's minuscule. So basically what we're saying is, for now, us actually going through a wormhole is still science fiction. For now it's science fiction, but that's the beauty of theoretical physics, right? We can explore these possibilities. We can push the boundary. Of what we think is possible. Of what's possible, exactly. And who knows what we'll discover in the future. Exactly. Yeah, so that's what makes this deep dive so interesting, right? I think so. We're venturing into the unknown. Absolutely. We're looking at things that really, who knows if they're even real? Right. But it's cool to think about. It's cool to think about. And you've got even more mind-blowing stuff in your sources. Oh yeah. That we're going to unpack in the next part. We're going to be diving into different types of wormholes and this connection between wormholes and parallel universes. It's going to get strange. All right, stay tuned. It's going to get even weirder. Yes. All right, so staple wormholes. Pretty big challenge to say the least, but your sources didn't shy away from some even more mind-bending possibilities. No, they didn't. And one that really caught my eye was this Morse-Thorne wormhole. The Morse-Thorne wormhole. Yeah. A classic model that tries to address the stability issue that we were just talking about. Okay. Instead of just relying on this kind of fleeting, momentary connection like the Schwarzschild wormhole, this one's held open by a spherical shell of exotic matter. So you're like building this stable tunnel through space-time? Exactly. With this negative energy stuff? Yeah, like a cosmic scaffolding. Yeah, like scaffolding holding it open. Yeah. Okay, but even if you could do that, one of the articles you sent was talking about some real hazards for anyone trying to go through this thing. Oh, it would not be a pleasant journey. No. The gravitational forces would be immense. Yeah. We're not just talking about feeling a little heavier. Right. We're talking about potentially being stretched and squeezed in ways that are very unpleasant. Not the smooth ride I was hoping for. Not at all. So it sounds like even thinking about traveling through a wormhole, we'd need some pretty advanced tech. For sure. Just to survive, let alone control where you're going. Yeah, we'd need to find a way to shield travelers from those extreme gravitational forces. Right. And maybe even stabilize that wormhole connection. Right. To make sure that you don't end up somewhere. Exactly. You don't want to be. Okay, so pushing the boundaries even further. Yes. You had this idea of wormholes connecting to parallel universes. Parallel universes. Now we're talking. Now we're talking. This is where things get really interesting. So imagine a wormhole not just as a shortcut through our own universe, but as a bridge to a completely different reality. Okay. A reality with its own laws of physics. So there could be another me out there. Potentially, yeah. Living a completely different life. A different version of you. Wow. Okay, but we need to reel it back in. We're getting a little speculative here. Right, right. We haven't even proven that wormholes exist in our own universe. Right. Let alone those connecting to other universes. Yeah, finding one of these things would be like finding... Incredibly difficult. A needle in an infinite haystack. Yes, exactly. Okay, so let's just say, for fun... Okay. That these inter-universal wormholes are out there. How would we even start looking for them? That's the challenge, right? We're going to need some new tools. Yeah. Some new ways of observing the universe. Because it's not like we can just point a telescope at it. Exactly, something beyond our current understanding of physics. You know, and one of your sources, it touched on this. Yes. Possible connection between wormholes and quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement. This ER equals EPR conjecture. Oh, yes. Very interesting. Some very complex. Some very complex, but I think we can break it down. Okay. So ER stands for Einstein-Rosen bridge. Which is another name for... Which is another name for wormholes. Wormhole, okay. And EPR refers to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. Right, which has to do with... Which basically highlights this very bizarre behavior of entangled particles. Okay, so entangled particles, we've talked about those before. Yes. They act like they're connected, even though they're... Miles apart. Years apart, potentially. Right, so maybe they have their own little wormhole. Well, that's what this conjecture suggests. Okay. That the entanglement we see in quantum mechanics might actually be explained by the existence of these microscopic wormholes connecting these particles. So they have their own little subway system? They have their own little quantum subway, yeah. Okay. And if that's true, it would be huge. Yeah. It would be a huge step toward unifying these two big theories in physics. General relativity. General relativity. Quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics. My brain is like melting right now. There's a lot to take in. So we're saying that these entangled particles... Yeah. That seems so weird. Maybe they're not so weird after all. Maybe not. They're just connected... Through these tiny wormholes. True wormholes. Yeah. Okay, and if we could figure out entanglement and do it on a big scale, could we make big wormholes? It's a possibility. Really? A highly speculative one. Okay. But think about the implications. Yeah. We could bypass the limitations of space and time. So we're talking about... Travel. Instantaneous. Instantaneous travel, communication. To anywhere in the universe. Anywhere across the universe. I'm already picturing... Amazing. Wormhole travel to distant galaxies. Yes. Maybe even to those parallel universes. The other universes. Okay, but again, we gotta... We gotta come back down to Earth a little bit. Right, right. Because there are still a lot of challenges. A lot of hurdles to overcome. A lot of scientific hurdles. And it's still theoretical. It's still theoretical, yeah. But your sources really... They really highlight... Highlight how important it is to explore these concepts. To push the boundaries. Because it challenges us to think about what we think we know. Exactly, about the
