## Transcript

Welcome to another deep dive. This time, we're going to take you on a journey through the world of an element. I bet you haven't thought about too much lately. Cadmium. Cadmium. Yeah, it's fascinating. We've got a whole stack of sources here. Wow. Everything from the Royal Society of Chemistry periodic table and Wikipedia to a scientific paper on its history and even a snippet from a chemistry podcast. Oh, wow. And trust me, there is so much more to this element than meets the eye. I believe it. Did you know that it was once used in medicines? Wow. But is also toxic enough to cause a disease with a name you won't soon forget? Ouch disease. Ouch disease. Let's dive in, find out why. Yeah, what's interesting about cadmium is that its story is kind of woven into so many different areas. Art, technology, health, and even the environment. It's like this hidden thread connecting all these different aspects of our world. Okay, so first things first, where can we find cadmium on the periodic table? Well, cadmium sits right below zinc in group 12, which gives us some clues about its behavior. Elements in the same group often share similar characteristics. And in this case, it means they both typically have an oxidation state of plus 2. Oh, so they're like chemical siblings with similar tendencies? Exactly. But what's really unique about cadmium is that it can also exist in a plus 1 state. Hmm. This ability to exist in different states is part of what makes it so versatile. It's like a chemical chameleon. It can adapt to different situations, allowing it to be used in a wider range of applications. Oh, that explains why it pops up in so many different places. I was reading on the Royal Society of Chemistry's website that it's also incredibly resistant to corrosion, unlike a lot of other metal. Yeah, that's right. That resistance to corrosion was a key factor in its early applications. I mean, think about it. A metal that doesn't rust easily. Yeah. That's a pretty valuable asset. Yeah, especially back then. It makes you wonder how something that was once considered so useful, even in medicine, turned out to be so harmful. Speaking of history, did you know that cadmium was actually discovered by accident? Yeah, it was 1817. And a chemist named Friedrich Stromeyer was working with zinc carbonate when he noticed something strange. Imagine his surprise when some of his samples, which should have produced pure white zinc oxide, turned yellow when heated. That's how he stumbled upon cadmium. What a moment of discovery. It really makes you wonder if he had any inkling of the impact this new element would have. So how did it get its name? Well, the name cadmium is actually derived from cadmia, the Latin word for calamine. You know that pink lotion people use for soothing skin irritations? Yeah. Calamine is a zinc ore, and that's where cadmium was first found lurking as an impurity. So the name is a nod to its origin story. That's a cool connection. But cadmium's story goes far beyond the lab. It actually had a rather glamorous debut in the art world. Ah, yes, the cadmium pigments. Those bright, lasting colors, especially the iconic cadmium yellow, were a favorite among artists. Imagine Van Gogh's sunflowers without that vibrant yellow. It just wouldn't be the same. It's fascinating how cadmium went from a lab curiosity to an essential part of an artist's palette. But that brings us to the darker side of its story. Remember that ouch-ouch disease we mentioned earlier? Yeah, despite its vibrant beauty, cadmium has a toxic side. And ouch-ouch disease, also known as itai-itai disease, is a stark reminder of that. It's amazing to think that something so beautiful could also be so harmful. What exactly causes this disease? It's a result of long-term exposure to high levels of cadmium. Often through contaminated food and water, the cadmium builds up in the body, especially in the kidneys, and over time, it wreaks havoc on the skeletal system. Oh, wow. So how does it get into our food and water in the first place? That's where the story of cadmium gets even more complex. We'll delve into the sources of cadmium pollution and its environmental impact after a short break. All right, I'm ready to be surprised. Because from what we've learned so far, it sounds like this element has quite a range. From art studios to something called ouch-ouch disease, I can't wait to hear what else it gets up to. Welcome back to our deep dive into the world of cadmium. So far, we've learned about cadmium's colorful history, its accidental discovery, and even its surprising role in the art world. But as we hinted at before, this seemingly simple element has a complex side. Okay, I'm all ears. What are some of these modern-day applications of cadmium that you mentioned? You might be surprised to learn that one of the biggest uses of cadmium is in batteries, specifically the rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Wait, really? Those are still around? Well, they are being phased out due to the toxicity concerns we've been discussing. But for a long time, they were the go-to for rechargeable batteries. And it highlights an important point. When it comes to technology, we often have to balance functionality with safety and environmental impact. Yeah, it really makes you wonder what those early inventors would think if they knew about the long-term effects of cadmium. So if those batteries are being phased out, where else is cadmium being used today? Well, it might surprise you to learn that cadmium is used in nuclear reactors. Hold on, nuclear reactors? That sounds a little intimidating. It does have a bit of a sci-fi ring to it, doesn't it? Yeah. But it plays a crucial role in controlling the fission process, which is essentially how nuclear power is generated. Cadmium rods are used to absorb neutrons and help regulate the chain reaction, preventing it from spiraling out of control. Wow, that's a pretty important job. So cadmium is essential for both energy storage and energy production. It seems like this element is full of surprises. And the surprises keep coming. Remember those quantum dot TVs we mentioned earlier? Oh yeah, those super high-definition ones that everyone's raving about? Those use cadmium too. The quantum dots that give those TVs such vibrant colors are actually tiny nanocrystals of cadmium selenide. It's a great example of how our understanding of chemistry at a nanoscale is leading to incredible technological advancements. It's amazing how something that was once a simple pigment is now being used to create cutting-edge technology. But with all these diverse applications, it makes you wonder about the potential impact on the environment. We know it's toxic, and we're using it in so many different ways. Should we be worried? That's a very valid concern. Cadmium pollution is a serious issue, and a lot of it stems from those industrial activities we talked about earlier, like mining and the burning of fossil fuels. I was reading in one of our sources that even the use of phosphate fertilizers can contribute to cadmium contamination in soil and water. That's right. And once cadmium gets into the environment, it doesn't just disappear. It can persist for a long time, accumulating in soil and water, and eventually making its way into the food chain. Remember that study we mentioned about rice samples in China? Right, the one where a significant portion of the samples had excess cadmium levels. That's pretty unsettling. It really highlights the interconnectedness of everything. What we put into the environment ultimately comes back to us one way or another. So what can we do about it? Are there ways to clean up cadmium contamination, or are we stuck with it? That's where science and innovation come into play. Scientists are actively working on developing methods to remediate cadmium-contaminated soil and water. One promising approach is called phytoremediation. Phytore-what now? It's actually a pretty simple concept. It involves using plants to absorb and accumulate cadmium from the soil. It's like using nature's own filtration system to clean up the mess we've made. That's a pretty ingenious solution. So instead of digging up tons of contaminated soil, we can just plant some special plants and let them do the work. It's not a perfect solution, but it's a step in the right direction. It's a great example of how we can use our understanding of science to develop sustainable solutions to environmental problems. And it underscores the importance of investing in research and development. This deep dive has been a real eye-opener. It's fascinating how cadmium, this element with a rich history and diverse applications, also presents us with some significant challenges. It really speaks to the complexity of our relationship with the natural world and the importance of responsible innovation. Okay, so we've covered a lot of ground, from cadmium's origins to its role in nuclear reactors and quantum dot TVs, and even its impact on the environment. But before we wrap up this deep dive, I want to touch on one more aspect of cadmium that might surprise you. All right, lay it on me. What else have you got up your sleeve? We've been talking about cadmium as a single entity, but it actually exists in a variety of forms. Cadmium compounds. Oh, right. I remember learning about compounds in chemistry class, but I'm a little rusty on the details. Could you refresh my memory? Of course. A cadmium compound is formed when cadmium chemically bonds with another element. For instance, you mentioned earlier how cadmium sulfide is used in photocopier drums. Right, it was mentioned in that chemistry podcast we listened to. Exactly. And remember those vibrant cadmium pigments used by artists? Those are actually cadmium compounds too. Cadmium sulfide for yellow, cadmium selenide for red, and
