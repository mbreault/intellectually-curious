## Description

A deep-dive journey from prehistoric counting to modern number theory, tracing how constants like zero, pi, the square root of 2, the golden ratio, and Euler's e have shaped math, science, and art. We'll explore how these fixed numbers arise from geometry, calculus, and computation, why some are irrational or uncomputable, and how newer constantsâ€”Champernowne, Mills', the MRB constant, and moreâ€”continue to widen our understanding of the mathematical universe.

## Transcript

Welcome back to our number theory series. Always great to be back. You know, in past episodes, we kind of explored like the basics of number systems, right? From simple accounting and then to, I guess, more complex concepts like prime numbers. Yeah. Divisibility. Yeah. Today we're going to dive into a new area, the fascinating world of mathematical constants. Yeah, these are really cool because they're deceptively simple, right? Okay. Numbers like pi or, you know, the golden ratio. Yeah, yeah. But they underpin huge areas of math and even physics. That's right. It's incredible how these fixed values, which are defined by very specific mathematical rules, they can hold so much significance. Yeah. So in this deep dive, we're going to kind of go on a journey, a chronological journey. Okay. And we'll trace the discovery and the impact of some of the key constants in the history of mathematics. Sounds good. So where do we even begin with something like this? Well, our journey, it actually begins way back in prehistory, long before we had written language even. Oh, okay. And even then, humans understood the concepts of one, two, and one half. Really? So these very basic, like counting numbers, were understood that far back? Yeah, they were essential, you know, for early counting and measurement. Right. And it really demonstrates that, like, an innate human fascination with numbers. Yeah, I think that's true. Like, we've always been drawn to them. Yeah. For sure. And these, you know, these weren't just, like, abstract ideas back then. They were really tools, you know, for understanding and interacting with the world. That's fascinating. So from those very basic building blocks, how did things progress? Well, as we move forward in time, we start encountering constants like pi, tau, both related to circles, obviously. Right. And then the square roots of two and three. Yeah. Now, these emerge from geometric problems. Okay. Things like, you know, trying to square the circle and understanding diagonals. I see, I see. Think of figures like Pythagoras. Of course. Whose theorem, you know, is forever linked to the square root of two. Absolutely, yeah. However, a lot of these constants were likely understood. Okay. Long before they were formally, you know, given names or studied in depth. That makes sense. It's like people were using these concepts. Right. But maybe didn't have the formal language or framework. Exactly. To really, like, define them yet. Exactly. So we have these early constants emerging from geometry. Was there any particular discovery that really kind of changed the game? Yeah, I think the square root of two was a big one. Okay. Because the realization that it could not be expressed as a simple fraction. Oh, okay, yeah. Led to this major discovery of irrational numbers. Right. Which really expanded the boundaries of mathematical understanding at the time. Yeah, so it wasn't just about the constant itself. It was about what it revealed. Yeah. About the nature of numbers. Exactly. That's really cool. So we've gone from, like, one to these very basic things to pi to the square root of two. Yeah. What comes next in this journey? Well, then we encounter the concept of zero. Oh, zero. Yeah. Which might seem simple, but is actually pretty profound. Yeah, it's interesting, right? Like, it's nothing. Right, but it's not just nothing. Oh, yeah. You know, it actually represents what we call the additive identity. Okay. Which is a crucial element in our number system. I see. So it has a deeper meaning than just the absence of something. Absolutely, yeah. Okay. And then after zero, we see negative numbers emerging. Right. Which further extended, you know, the number line. Yeah. And opened up all sorts of possibilities. That's right. It allowed us to represent things like debts. Right, exactly. Directions. And just more sophisticated mathematical operations in general. Exactly. Yeah, so these early discoveries, it seems like they really laid the groundwork for some even more fascinating constants. They did. Yeah, these early discoveries, it seems like they really laid the groundwork for some even more fascinating constants. They did, yeah. I guess one that comes to mind is the golden ratio. Oh, yeah. Often represented by the Greek letter phi. Phi, yeah. The golden ratio has captivated mathematicians, artists, architects for centuries. Really? It appears, you know, you find it in art, architecture, even nature. Wow. It's everywhere. So what exactly is it? I mean, how is it defined? So it's based on the Fibonacci sequence. Okay. You know, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Right, right. One, two, three, five, eight. Exactly. So the ratio between these consecutive Fibonacci numbers, it approaches phi, which is approximately 1.618. I see. But it's more than just, you know, a mathematical curiosity. Like, you'll find it in the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower, the spiral of a nautilus shell. There's this kind of underlying harmony in nature. That's amazing. So we've gone from, you know, ancient Greek geometry with these constants to, I guess, more modern constants. Yeah. What kind of bridges that gap? Well, a key figure here is Leonhard Euler. Oh, of course, Euler. Yeah, one of the most prolific mathematicians of all time. Absolutely. And he's associated with several important constants, including Euler's number, which is represented by the letter E. Right, E. So he might seem a little bit abstract, but it's actually crucial in calculus. Yeah, absolutely. For understanding growth and decay. It's everywhere. It pops up in a lot of natural phenomena, too. It does, yeah. You know, it might seem like a big jump from something like the square root of 2 to Euler's number, but it really demonstrates how mathematics builds upon those previous discoveries. You know, it's constantly expanding. Right, into these new realms. Exactly. It's pretty fascinating that Euler's number, like the square root of 2, is also irrational. Right. Its decimal representation just goes on forever without repeating. Without repeating, and yet it arises so naturally in so many different contexts. Like it's pointing to something. Right. Fundamental about how the universe works. Exactly. So Euler is also associated with another constant, right? Yeah. Euler's constant. Also known as the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Okay. Represented by the Greek letter gamma. Gamma, okay. And what's the deal with that one? Well, this constant, it's related to the harmonic series. Okay. And it's still somewhat mysterious, honestly. Really? Yeah, so we know its value to a high degree of precision, but we don't actually have a closed-form expression for it. Okay, so we can calculate it, but we don't have a neat little formula. Yeah, like a tidy formula. To capture its essence. Yeah, we haven't quite figured that out yet. It's intriguing that even with centuries of mathematical exploration, there are still these secrets out there. There are. Waiting to be unlocked. Absolutely. And the world of mathematical constants, it doesn't sound like it's static. No, it's always expanding. It's constantly growing, yeah. So how many mathematical constants are out there? Well, there are hundreds that we know of. Wow. And each one has its own story, its own role in various fields. Okay. For example, take the MRB constant. MRB, okay. Now it's derived from a seemingly simple alternating series, but its value is both irrational and more importantly, uncomputable. Uncomputable? What does that even mean? That means we can't define a finite algorithm to determine its exact value. So we can't write a program to spit out the number? We can't calculate it exactly. We can approximate it. Okay. But we can never pin it down precisely. It challenges our assumptions about what we can truly know for certain in mathematics. So this whole category of uncomputable numbers out there? There is, yeah. And that's part of what makes exploring mathematical constants so alluring. There's always something new to discover, another layer to peel back. So what other, I guess, strange and wonderful constants are out there? Well, consider the Champernowne constant. Okay. Now it's constructed by stringing together all the natural numbers in decimal form. So you have 0.12345678910111213, so on and so forth. It seems a little arbitrary. It does, yeah. Almost whimsical. But it has deeper connections. It does, yeah. To other areas of math. To other mathematical areas, yeah. It's like a tapestry. It is, yeah. Woven from the fabric of our counting system. That's a great way to put it, yeah. And it illustrates how even these seemingly random constructions can have a very rigorous mathematical definition. That's pretty cool. Yeah. And then, of course, you have constants related to prime numbers. Oh, okay, like? Like Mills' constant. Mills' constant, okay. Yeah. What's special about Mills' constant? Well, it has this remarkable property. It generates prime numbers. It generates prime numbers. It does. So if you raise Mills' constant to the power of three, take the integer part of the result, you get a prime number. Okay. Raise it to the power of three squared, take the integer part, another prime number, and so on. It's like a secret code for unlocking the sequence of prime numbers. Exactly. We're uncovering hidden treasures in this vast expanse of mathematics. That's what it feels like, doesn't it? It does. Yeah. And like any treasure hunt, there are still mysteries to be solved. Oh, okay. Remember Br
