## Transcript

Welcome back to the deep dive. Ready to explore something new? Always. This time we're taking a deep dive into the world of bismuth. Bismuth? Yeah, you probably know it from Pepto-Bismol. Oh, right, for upset stomachs. But trust me, there's a whole lot more to this element. Oh, I bet. What kind of sources do we have today? We've got excerpts from the Royal Society of Chemistry's website. There's the Wikipedia page on bismuth and an article all about its applications. Sounds like we've got a lot to uncover. We do. We'll be unearthing bismuth's history, its unique properties, you know, like, did you know it can make spoons vanish? Make spoons vanish? Now that's intriguing. Right. We'll cover that, and of course, we'll explore its many uses. Let's dive in, then. So where do we even begin with bismuth? I mean, it's been around for ages. It has. Our sources say it was known since ancient times. But there's a catch. A catch? People often mistook it for lead or tin back then. Hmm, so some historical objects thought to be made of lead or tin could actually be bismuth. That's fascinating. Yeah. Talk about hiding in plain sight. Exactly. It wasn't until the 18th century that scientists truly recognized it as a separate element. It's amazing how long it can take to, like, fully understand something. Absolutely. But once bismuth was identified, people started discovering its incredible properties. Like its diamagnetism. Precisely. Bismuth is exceptionally good at repelling magnets. Like, really good. One of the best, actually. More so than almost any other element. So if you held a strong magnet near bismuth... It would actually push away from the magnet. That's wild. And on top of that, it's got this incredibly low thermal conductivity. Right. Most metals conduct heat really well. But bismuth... It's the exception. One of the least thermally conductive metals out there. So it's like the odd one out in the metal family. In a way, yeah. And there's one more curious fact. Bismuth actually expands when it freezes. Wait, doesn't most stuff shrink when it freezes? You'd think so, right. But bismuth does the opposite. Hold on, isn't that what water does? You're absolutely right. Water is another exception. Okay, so bismuth is an exception to the exception. Kind of, yeah. And this unusual property actually has some important implications. Especially when you use bismuth in alloys, right? You got it. In fact, this very characteristic was behind a popular trick in Victorian times. A trick? Do tell. It was called the vanishing spoons. Vanishing spoons. Sounds like something out of a magic show. It was a bit of chemistry magic, really. They would make spoons from a special bismuth alloy. Special how? This alloy had a melting point just below the boiling point of water. Okay. So when you stirred your hot tea with one of these spoons, it would melt and seemingly disappear. No way! That's amazing. Right? It's like a perfect example of how the melting point of different bismuth alloys... Determines their use, exactly. This is proving that bismuth is way more than just a stomach soother. It is. And speaking of which, we should dive into its applications. Started with its role in medicine. Of course. Bismuth subsalicylate. The active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol. Yep. I read somewhere that bismuth is also used in other medicines, like for ulcers. That's right. It seems to have a knack for treating digestive problems. Bismuth. The digestive system's best friend. Maybe so. But bismuth isn't a one-trick pony. It's used in cosmetics, too. Cosmetics. Now that's a surprise. Yep. Bismuth oxychloride is a common ingredient in makeup. What does it do? It gives things like eyeshadow, lipstick, and nail polish that shimmery, pearlescent sheen. Oh, so it's like natural glitter. Exactly. It occurs naturally as a mineral called bismuclite. And its structure helps to refract light and create that iridescent effect. I've got to say, this is way more interesting than I thought it would be. Glad to hear it. And speaking of things that sparkle, what about those bismuth crystals? The ones with all the rainbow colors? Yeah. They're stunning. I've seen pictures. They're mesmerizing. They truly are. And those vibrant colors are due to light reflecting off the oxide layer on the crystal surface. It's amazing what nature can create, huh? Absolutely. And here's a fun fact. You can actually grow bismuth crystals at home. Oh, wow. I might have to try that sometime. But bismuth is more than just pretty, right? It's also used in important things like fire safety. You're right. Bismuth is a key ingredient in fire detectors, extinguishers, and sprinkler systems. Why is that? Well, remember, it's low melting point. Yeah. When there's a fire, the heat triggers the bismuth alloy to melt. That activates the safety mechanism. So it's like a built-in safety switch. Pretty much. Now, let's talk about another important application that's becoming increasingly relevant. Replacing lead. Exactly. It's a perfect substitute because bismuth has a similar density to lead. But with one huge advantage. It's much less toxic. Right. So we can use it in things where lead is a concern, like for the environment or for people's health. Bismuth is stepping up to be the eco-friendly hero. I like that. The eco-friendly hero replacing lead in everything from bullets to fishing weights. It's impressive how this once misunderstood element is now protecting our planet. And it doesn't stop there. Bismuth is even being used as a lead replacement in electronics. This is where it gets even more interesting. Because traditional solders, those often contain lead. They do. And that can be a problem if it leaches into the environment. Not good. Right. So there's this big push to replace lead-based solders with bismuth-based ones. Especially in things like food processing equipment or plumbing. Makes sense. Places where toxicity is a big concern. Like a domino effect. The more we learn about bismuth, the more we find uses for it. And the more we can use it to protect our health and the planet. Absolutely. And you know, this shift is getting a boost from things like the European Union's ROWS directive. The one that restricts hazardous substances in electronics? Yep. That's pushing for more bismuth-based solders and other bismuth materials. So bismuth is helping make our electronics more eco-friendly too. Exactly. But its talents don't stop there. Remember how we talked about bismuth expanding when it solidifies? I'm still amazed by that. Well, that property is incredibly valuable in creating alloys with very specific characteristics. I can only imagine. This expansion allows bismuth to be used in high-precision casting. For example, in dentistry. Really? Yep. They use it to make detailed molds. As the bismuth alloy cools and solidifies, it expands. To fill the mold perfectly. Exactly. It compensates for the shrinkage of other metals in the alloy. That's amazing. And that results in an incredibly precise final product. Precisely. And what about those low-melting alloys? What are those used for? Oh, all sorts of things. Safety valves in boilers, fuses in electrical circuits, even automatic sprinkler systems. Wow. It's remarkable how bismuth can be found in so many different things. From vanishing spoons to fire safety systems. Bismuth really is the element of hidden talents. It really is. So we're back, and I'm ready to learn more about bismuth's more specialized applications. More specialized? Like what? Well, I read about its use in nuclear medicine. Nuclear medicine. Yeah. That's interesting. Especially since we've been talking about how non-toxic bismuth is. I know, right? It seems kind of counterintuitive. It does, but it all comes down to radioactive isotopes. Oh, okay. Bismuth has those. Specifically, bismuth-213. And this bismuth-213, it's got a really short half-life. Huh. That's kind of odd for bismuth, isn't it? It is, but that's actually what makes it useful for medical treatments. Okay, I'm listening. So bismuth-213, it undergoes this process called alpha decay. It emits alpha particles. Alpha particles. Yeah, and those alpha particles, they can be pretty damaging to cells, especially cancerous ones. So it's like a tiny weapon against cancer. That's a great way to put it. It's used in something called targeted alpha therapy, or TAT. How does that work? They attach bismuth-213 to a molecule that targets cancer cells. Oh, I see. So those powerful alpha particles are delivered right to the tumor. And that minimizes damage to healthy cells. Exactly. That's incredible. What kinds of cancer can they treat with this? It's showing promise for certain leukemias, and researchers are looking into other cancers too. So bismuth's unique properties are being used for very specific medical purposes. You got it. Now, shifting gears a bit, I read about bismuth being a thermoelectric material. Ah, yes. I'll be honest, I'm not entirely sure what that means. Well, in simple terms, a thermoelectric material can convert heat energy into electrical energy. And vice versa. And vice versa, exactly. So you're saying we can use bismuth to generate electricity from heat
