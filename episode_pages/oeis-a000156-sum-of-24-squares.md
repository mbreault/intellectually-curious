## Transcript

Welcome back, everyone, to our ongoing deep dive into the OEIS. Yeah. Today we're looking at sequence A000156. Okay. And this one, it might seem a little esoteric at first glance. Right. It deals with a number of ways to express an integer as the sum of 24 squares. Wow. 24 squares. That's a lot. Yeah, you heard that right. 24 squares. Well, what's fascinating is that this isn't just some arbitrary mathematical curiosity. Yeah. The choice of 24 is deeply connected to some pretty profound concepts in number theory. Okay, so let's unpack this a little. Sure. We're taking an integer, like say 5, and figuring out how many different combinations of 24 squares add up to it. Exactly. And you can imagine the number of possible combinations grows pretty rapidly as the integer increases. Oh, wow. The sequence starts with 1, then jumps to 48 for the number 2, then 1104 for 3. Wow. It's a testament to the hidden complexity lurking beneath seemingly simple mathematical ideas. So we're not just talking about simple addition here. There's a lot more going on under the hood. Absolutely. The formulas used to calculate these terms involve some pretty advanced mathematical machinery, including concepts like Ramanujan's tau function and sums of divisors raised to the 11th power. Now, I remember Ramanujan's tau function from my number theory courses. Of course. But I'm having trouble seeing how it fits into all of this. Yeah. Can you shed some light on that? Sure. One of the formulas used to generate the terms of this sequence actually utilizes the tau function, which is this incredibly versatile tool in number theory. What's remarkable is that this formula essentially links the world of sums of squares to the world of modular forms through the tau function. It acts as a kind of bridge between these seemingly disparate concepts. So we're talking about modular forms. Yes. Those are functions with those amazing symmetry properties, right? That's right. The ones that show up all over number theory. And the fact that they emerge in this context hints at a much deeper level of structure within this sequence than might be apparent at first glance. Wow. The formula provides a concrete computational link, allowing us to calculate the terms of the sequence using values of the tau function. That's incredible. Yeah. So we're not just dealing with a list of numbers here. Right. But with a sequence that touches upon some of the most fundamental concepts in number theory. Absolutely. What about this other formula? You mentioned the one with the divisors? Right. How does that work? That formula dives into the world of divisor functions, which, as you know... Yeah. Tell us about the divisors of a given number. Right. What's remarkable about this particular formula is that it uses the sum of the 11th powers of the divisors. Wow. It's a way of extracting information about the structure of a number through its divisors and then connecting that information to the number of ways it can be expressed as the sum of 24 squares. It sounds like we're just scratching the surface here. This seemingly straightforward question about sums of squares has led us to modular forms, divisor functions, and the tau function. It has. What else is hidden within this sequence? Well, for starters, there's another formula that involves a recursive approach where we calculate a term in the sequence based on the values of previous terms. This particular recursive formula actually links our sequence, A000156, to another sequence in the OEIS. One that deals with the representation of integers as the sum of 12 squares. So it's like these sequences are all interconnected, forming a sort of web of mathematical relationships. Yeah. That's fascinating. Can you give us a sense of what this recursive formula looks like? Sure. One version looks like this. A of n equals 48 over n times the sum from k equals 1 to n of A186690 of k times A of n minus k with A of 0 equals 1. You can see that to calculate the nth term, we need to know the values of all preceding terms as well as corresponding terms from the sequence for sums of 12 squares. It's almost like building a tower, brick by brick, where each level depends on the ones below it. It's a powerful way of thinking about generating these complex sequences. It is. But I'm still curious about that connection to modular forms. Okay. What can you tell us about that? Right. Well, to really appreciate that link, we need to talk about generating functions. Essentially, the generating function for our sequence, the one capturing the number of ways to express integers as the sum of 24 squares, can be expressed in terms of a specific modular form. Hold on, just a quick reminder. Sure. What exactly is a generating function again? Yes, good point. It's like a compact code for the entire sequence, a power series where each coefficient corresponds to a term in the sequence. Okay, that's coming back to me now. Good. So this generating function, which encapsulates all the information about our sequence, is tied to a modular form, one of those functions with the remarkable symmetry property. Precisely. And because of that connection, we can leverage the powerful theory of modular forms to probe the deeper structure and properties of our sequence. Wow. It's a beautiful example of how seemingly disparate areas of mathematics can come together to illuminate a problem. It's like we're using different lenses to examine this sequence. Right. Each revealing new facets of its complexity and beauty. But before we get too carried away, I think it's time to wrap up part one of our deep dive. A good place to pause indeed, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. Right. There's so much more to explore with this fascinating sequence. And we're back, continuing our exploration of OEIS sequence A000156. Right. This intriguing sequence that tallies the ways to represent integers as sums of 24 squares. We've already encountered modular forms, divisor functions, and even a recursive formula that connects this sequence to another one dealing with sums of 12 squares. Yeah. It feels like we're uncovering a hidden network within the world of numbers. It's a beautiful web of connections indeed. And there's still more to uncover. Each formula we've discussed provides a unique perspective. Okay. A different lens through which to examine the sequence. You mentioned earlier that the formula involving Ramanujan's tau function hints at something deeper about the structure of this sequence. I did. Can you elaborate on that? Absolutely. The appearance of modular forms here is a significant clue. Okay. It suggests that this sequence might be more than just a list of numbers. Right. It might be encoding information about deeper mathematical structures. Okay. That piques my curiosity. What kind of information could a sequence like this encode? Sure. And how do modular forms come into play? Well, remember that modular forms are these special functions defined on the complex plane possessing remarkable symmetry properties. Yeah. They pop up in various areas of number theory, and their presence often signals deep underlying structures. Right. We talked about those symmetries earlier. We did. But how do they relate to the actual terms of our sequence? Think of it this way. The formula connects the number of ways to express an integer as the sum of 24 squares to the value of a specific modular form at a particular point. Right. It's like the modular form is acting as a sort of blueprint. Okay. And the sequence is a manifestation of that blueprint in the realm of integers. So it's not just that we can use modular forms to calculate terms. Right. It's that the sequence itself seems to be governed by the properties of these forms. Exactly. That's really thought-provoking. It is. But we've also touched upon another intriguing concept. Right. A recursive formula that ties this sequence to one for sums of 12 squares. Yes. That connection highlights the interconnectedness of sequences within the OEIS. Right. They're not isolated entities but rather nodes in a vast network of mathematical relationships. Right. And this particular connection suggests that there might be a deeper relationship between sums of squares for different numbers of squares. That makes sense. After all, we're dealing with squares in both cases. Right. It wouldn't be surprising if there were some underlying mathematical structure connecting them. Could you remind us what that recursive formula looks like? Sure. It's A of N equals 48 over N times the sum from K equals 1 to N of A186690 of K times A of N minus K where A of 0 equals 1. Right. Notice how we're using terms from sequence A186690 which deals with sums of 12 squares to calculate terms in our sequence for sums of 24 squares. It's like a mathematical recipe where the ingredients for one dish are used to create a completely different dish. Right. It's quite elegant actually, but I'm also wondering about the practical implications of all of this. Okay. Does knowing the number of ways to express an integer as the sum of 24 squares have any real-world applications? That's a question that often comes up with pure mathematics. Right. While there may not be immediate direct applications in fields like engineering or physics, the study of sums of squares has had a significant impact on other areas of mathematics. Can you give us some examples? Where does this seemingly abstract concept show up in a practical way? Well, for instance, the theory of sums of squares is intimately connected to the study of quadratic forms, which have wide-ranging applications in number theory, cryptography, and even physics. Oh, wow. The insights we gain from studying sums of squares can be applied to solve problems in these seemingly unrelated fields. So it's like we're building a foundation of knowledge here. Exactly. And that foundation can be used to construct all sorts of interesting structures in other areas of mathematics. Right. It's a reminder that even the most abstract mathematical explorations can have unexpected consequences. Precisely. And this is just one example. The study of sums of squares has also
