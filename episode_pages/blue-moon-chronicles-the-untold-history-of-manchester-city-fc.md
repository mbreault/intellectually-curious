## Transcript

All right, strap yourselves in. We're diving deep into Manchester City Football Club today. Sounds exciting. We've got excerpts from their Wikipedia page and a timeline from Manchester City FC, A Complete History. Wow. So we're going to be going way beyond just like scores and trophies. Really dig in. Yeah. You ready to unearth some truly wild stories? I'm ready. Let's go. All right. So for those who might not be totally up on English football, let's set the scene a little bit. You've got multiple leagues. Right. And teams move up or down based on how well they do each season. Gotcha. Then you've got these cup competitions like the FA Cup. Yep. Which add another layer of excitement and competition. Absolutely. So Man City has been navigating this whole system for over a century. Over a century. Wow. Yeah. They actually started as a church team, believe it or not. A church team. Seriously. Think of back in 1880. That's a far cry from the multi-million dollar operation they are today. It's crazy, right? They went through a few different names before settling on Manchester City FC in 1894. Okay. But even in those early days, they were making some noise. They got promoted to the First Division, which was the top tier back then. Wow. Only five years after becoming Manchester City. That's pretty quick. Talk about a meteoric rise. Yeah. And I heard they snagged their first major trophy pretty soon after that too. Yeah, you bet. They won the FA Cup in 1904. The FA Cup. Missed out on a league and cup double. Oh, so close. But here's where things get a little spicy. Just a couple years later, they got hit with allegations of financial irregularities. Oh, so the drama started early on. Yeah. Is this a recurring theme in their history? Well, let's just say financial matters have had a big impact on the club. I see. Those early allegations led to a mass suspension of players in 1906. Wow. Including their captain, Billy Meredith, who then ended up playing for their arch rivals, Manchester United. Ouch. Talk about adding fuel to the rivalry fire. Oh, yeah. But amidst all that, they moved to their iconic Main Road Stadium in 1923. Main Road. Ah, legendary. It became their fortress. Witnessed tons of historic moments. I'll bet. It's where they set that incredible home attendance record in 1934. Over 84,000 fans packed in to watch them play Stoke City in the FA Cup. Wow. Can you imagine the atmosphere? Electric. That gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. And that record stood for over 80 years. 80 years. That's insane. It is pretty wild. But Main Road wasn't just about record crowds. Right. They had some serious on-field success there too. I was going to say. They reached two FA Cup finals in the 1930s. Okay. Lost the first one. Right. But won the second. Got it. And in 1937, they won their first league title. So they were establishing themselves as a major force in English football. Oh, yeah. For sure. But you mentioned their history is full of highs and lows. So I'm guessing this success didn't last forever. You're catching on quick. The season after winning their first league title, they got relegated. Talk about a rollercoaster ride. Talk about a fall from grace. That's a tough game, though, football. It really is. One minute you're on top of the world, the next you're fighting to climb back up. It's all about resilience, I guess. And speaking of resilience, didn't you mention something about a goalkeeper playing with a broken neck? I did. That's got to be a story for the ages. Oh, it definitely is. Picture this 1956 FA Cup final. Okay. Manchester City versus Birmingham City. All right. Bert Troutman, City's legendary German goalkeeper. Okay. Collides with an opposing player. Oh, this is where he makes a miraculous save even though he's injured or something? Even more incredible, he plays on for the remaining 15 minutes. Wow. And helps City win 3-1. No way. And then after the match, they find out he has a broken neck. He had a broken neck? Are you kidding me? That's next level toughness. It is. I can't even imagine the pain he must have been in. Unbelievable, right? What a story. Talk about dedication to the team. It's a testament to his resilience. Absolutely. And it's a story that has become part of Manchester City folklore. So after this crazy FA Cup win, did things start looking up for City? Was this like the beginning of a golden era or something? It was. They appointed Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison as managers in 1965. Okay. And that marked the beginning of some serious success. The Mercer-Allison era. I've heard about this. Yeah. Weren't they known for their attacking style of play? Yeah. They weren't afraid to take risks. I like that. They had a knack for getting the best out of their players. So they knew how to motivate. Oh, yeah. So what happened? Well, they won the second division title in their first season. Okay. And then two years later, they clinched the league championship again. Back on top. Back in the big time. And this was when players like Colin Bell and Mike Summerbee were part of the team. Ah, yes. The legends. These guys embodied the spirit of the club. Right. And they helped create this legacy that still resonates with fans today. For sure. And the trophies didn't stop there, right? Nope. They won the FA Cup in 1969. Okay. Another FA Cup. And then in 1970, they did something remarkable. All right. I'm on the edge of my seat. What happened in 1970? They won the European Cup Winners' Cup. Their first ever continental trophy. Wow. And they also won the League Cup. So they got a double. They did. They became only the second English team ever to achieve a European and domestic cup double in the same season. Talk about a season for the history books. It was incredible. At this point, Manchester City were a force to be reckoned with. Both domestically and in Europe. Yeah. But I have a feeling this golden era couldn't last forever. You're right. Nothing lasts forever in football. Hmm. Malcolm Allison came back as manager in 1979. Okay. And despite spending a lot of money, he couldn't recreate the magic of his earlier time with the club. Right. And this led to a period of instability with a bunch of different managers. Oh, no. And unfortunately, two relegations from the top flight in the 1980s. So even the mighty Manchester City have experienced their fair share of struggles. They have. It's amazing how quickly things can change in football. It really is. But they did manage to bounce back, right? They did. But it was a rollercoaster. They returned to the top flight in 1989. Okay. And even finished fifth in the first division in 91 and 92 under Peter Reid. Fifth. Not bad. But it was short-lived, unfortunately. So as we head into the 1990s and the Premier League era, things weren't looking so bright for City. Not quite yet. But we'll dive into that exciting and sometimes turbulent chapter in part two of our deep dive. Welcome back to our deep dive into the wild world of Manchester City. Last time we left off with the club kind of bouncing around between the top two tiers of English football. Right. It was a bit of a rollercoaster ride. It was. They were even part of that very first Premier League season in 1992. Huge moment for English football. Absolutely. Yeah. But their time in the top flight... It didn't last. Yeah. It was pretty short-lived. Relegated in 96 and then again in 98, which sent them all the way down to the third tier. Wow. From winning league titles to the third tier? That's a tough fall. It was a humbling experience for sure. It's been hard for the fans too. It was. But even in those dark times, there was a glimmer of hope. Okay. Tell me more. Joe Royal came in as manager. Joe Royal? Yeah. And they fought their way back to the Premier League. So two promotions in a row. Back to back really showed their fighting spirit. That's the kind of comeback story that you love to see. But things were about to change in a big way. Oh yeah. 2008, everything changed. What happened? The Abu Dhabi United Group, led by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, took over the club. That was a game changer. Not just for Man City, but for English football. Absolutely. Suddenly they had seemingly endless resources. Right. And they weren't afraid to use them. Their first signing under the new ownership was Robinho. From Real Madrid. And they broke the British transfer record to get him. Talk about a statement. They were here to compete. It was a message to the rest of the league. We're not messing around. But it's not like they instantly became a dominant force, right? Well, it takes more than just money to build a winning team. Right. It's about the manager, the tactics, the players gelling together. It's complex. It is. They went through a few managers before landing on Roberto Mancini. Mancini, yeah. He brought a certain swagger to the club, a winning mentality. And what happened? Well, under Mancini, they ended their 35-year trophy drought. No way. That's a long time. By winning the FA Cup in 2011. Okay,
