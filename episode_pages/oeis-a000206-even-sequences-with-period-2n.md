Learn about OEIS A000206 Even Sequences with Period 2n

## Transcript

Welcome to the deep dive. Today we're venturing into the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, the OEIS. For anyone studying number theory, you'll know the OEIS is, well, just invaluable. It's this huge catalog of number patterns. It really is an amazing resource, a map, as you say, to patterns and connections, some quite unexpected. Exactly. And today's sequence is OEIS A00026. The title is Even Sequences with Period 2n. That title does pack a lot in. It does. It mentions even sequences, a period 2n, and then connects it to even orbits of binary necklaces of length 2n under the group DNxS2. Okay, definitely a few terms there to clarify. Yeah, let's break it down for everyone, especially our number theory students listening in. Maybe start with binary sequence. Sure, a binary sequence is just, well, a sequence made up of zeros and ones, simple as that, in computer code. Got it. Zeros and ones and period 2n. That just means the sequence repeats itself every 2n terms. So the pattern restarts after that block of 2n digits. Like a repeating wallpaper pattern, but with numbers. Okay, now necklace, a binary necklace. Right. Imagine taking that sequence of zeros and ones and arranging it in a circle, like beads on a necklace. Ah, so the cyclic part is key. Exactly. There's no fixed start or end. If you can rotate one arrangement to get another, they're considered the same necklace. Like 001 is 0101 is the same as 100 with the length is 3. Okay, that makes sense. Equivalence under rotation. Which leads us to orbits of a group action. Intuitive. You have a set of things are necklaces, and you have a set of allowed transformations, symmetries, like rotations. Okay. The group action is applying these symmetries. An orbit is basically a collection of all the necklaces you can reach from one starting necklace just by using the allowed symmetries. So everything in one orbit is considered equivalent under those symmetries. Precisely. We're grouping things that are fundamentally the same from the perspective of the symmetries. And the specific group here is DN cross S2. Let's unpack those parts. DN. DN is the dihedral group of degree N. It represents the symmetries of a regular N-sided polygon. Like a triangle or a square. Exactly. It includes rotations around the center end of them, and also reflections or flips in other end of them. So 2N symmetries in total for DN. Rotations and flips. Okay. And S2. S2 is much smaller. The symmetric group on two elements. It basically has just two operations. Which are? The identity do nothing, and the swap. In our case, acting on binary necklaces, that swap operation corresponds to inverting the colors. Ah, changing all the zeros to ones and all the ones back to zeros. That's the one. So DN cross S2 means we're considering combinations of these actions, like rotate and maybe invert. Or reflect and don't invert. Exactly right. A symmetry from DN paired with a symmetry from S2. Two necklaces are equivalent if you can get from one to the other using one of these combined actions. Okay, that's a lot of potential equivalences. But then there's this word even. Even orbits. What's that about? That tells us we're not counting all the possible orbits under DN cross S2. We're only counting a specific subset of them. The ones that satisfy some condition that makes them even. And we don't immediately know what that condition is just from the title. Not explicitly, no. But as often happens with the OEIS, the formula provided for the sequence gives us some big clues. Right. So our mission for this deep dive is to understand what A00026 counts these specific even orbits and really get a feel for how group theory and combinatorics come together here. It's a great example, actually. It shows how these abstract group structures help us solve very concrete counting problems, especially when symmetry is involved. It feels like we're peeling back layers. Let's go back to the necklace idea. That length 3 example is helpful. Eight strings, but only four distinct necklaces under rotation. Yes, 0, 0, they all the same. 1, 1, they all 1, 1. Then 0, 0, 1, which covers 0, 10, and 100 by rotation. And 0, 11, which covers 101 and 110. Four orbits under just rotation. So that's the cyclic group C3 acting. But now we bring in DN cross S2, well, DN and S2 more generally, and for length 2n. Correct. We have the rotational symmetry, potentially reflections too, depending on how we interpret DN acting on the 2, 2, 2 in positions. And crucially, this inversion symmetry from S2. Flipping the zeros and ones. So under DN cross S2, maybe 0, 0 and 1, 1 become equivalent. They could, yes. If the inversion operation is applied, 1000 maps to 1 and 11. So they would likely belong to the same orbit under this larger group action. Same for, say, the 0, 0, 1, 0, 10, 100 orbit and the 0, 1, 1, 1, 10 orbit. Inversion swaps those. Ah, I see. So the inversion symmetry can merge orbits that were distinct under rotational alone. It often does exactly that. Okay, so we have the objects, binary necklaces of length 2n, and the symmetries, DN cross S2. How do we actually count the distinct orbits? You mentioned Burnside's lemma. Yes, Burnside's lemma. Sometimes called the Cauchy-Frobenius lemma or simply the orbit counting theorem. It's the powerhouse tool for this kind of problem. And how does it work, essentially, without getting lost in the full proof? The core idea is surprisingly elegant. It states that the number of distinct orbits is the average number of items that are left unchanged or fixed by each symmetry operation in the group. Average number of fixed items. Yeah. You look at each symmetry in your group one by one. For each symmetry, you count how many of your objects, necklaces, in our case look exactly the same after you apply that symmetry. Okay. Then you sum up all those counts, one count for each symmetry, and finally you divide that total sum by the total number of symmetries in your group. So sum the number of fixed items for every symmetry, then divide by the size of the group. That's it. The formula looks like xg equals 1g times the sum of xg for all g and g. Where xg is the number of orbits, g is the group size. Which is 4n here, right? 2n for dn times 2 for s2. Careful, the size of dn is 2n. The size of dn x s2 is 2n 2 equals 4n, yes. Ah, right, 4n symmetries. And xg is the number of necklaces fixed by symmetry g, and x is the set of all 2 2 2m binary sequences. Right. Calculating that seems potentially very involved. You'd have to analyze all 4n symmetries? It can be quite detailed, yes. Especially figuring out the fixed points for combined rotation reflection and inversion symmetries. But that's the process. And the OEIS entry A00026, it basically gives us the result of that calculation, but specifically for the even orbits. Exactly. Someone, likely Gilbert and Riordan, based on the OEIS references, went through the Burnside's lemma calculation for this specific group action, and then somehow filtered for or identified the orbits that meet this even criterion. Okay, let's look at that formula on the OEIS page again. It depends on whether n is even or odd. Right. For n even, it's A00026 with n plus 4 n 2 1 2 and 2 1 2. And for n odd, it's simpler. A000011. Yeah. What's A000011 again? That's a more fundamental sequence. It counts the number of distinct binary necklaces of length k. Here k is 2n. Or considering only rotational symmetry, it's derived using Burnside's lemma too, but just with the cyclic group seco. Ah, so the count for our more complex symmetry group, dn x s2, and the even condition is built directly from the count under simple rotation. It seems so. The A0001n to meta term appears in both cases. This suggests the even orbits somehow relate strongly to the total number of rotationally distinct necklaces of length 2n. And those extra terms, when n is even, the 4 to the power of something and 2 to the power of something. Those likely come from analyzing the fixed points for specific types of symmetries, perhaps reflections or combinations involving inversion, whose structure depends critically on whether n, and thus 2n, has factors of 2. So the parity of n really matters for how the inversion and the dn symmetries interact. It appears to be crucial. The difference in the formulas is stark. It points towards the even condition being tied to how these symmetries behave differently depending on n's parity. Maybe it relates to whether an orbit is symmetric with respect to inversion or something along those lines. Without diving into the original paper, it's hard to say for sure what even means, but the formula tells us how to count them, relating it back to simpler necklace counting.
