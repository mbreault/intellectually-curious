## Description

Why does time only move forward? In this episode we trace the idea from Eddingtonâ€™s entropy insight to a family of time arrowsâ€”thermodynamic, cosmological, radiative, and causalâ€”plus the quantum arrow. Through intuitive examples like the shattering glass and how waves radiate, we explore how entropy, causality, and the laws of physics shape our sense of time. We also look at modern experiments that hint the quantum arrow might be an emergent property from thermodynamics, not a fundamental clock built into the universe. A mind-bending tour of the direction we all experience as time.

## Transcript

Hey there, physics fans. Welcome to our deep dive on a pretty mind-bending topic, the arrow of time. You know, that whole idea that time moves forward from past to future. But have you ever thought about why it only goes in one direction? It really is one of those things we take for granted, isn't it? I mean, we experience it every single day, but explaining this one-way direction of time, well, that's a question that's kept scientists and philosophers busy for centuries, really. And speaking of scientists and centuries, there was this guy, Arthur Eddington, back in the 1920s. He was a British astrophysicist. He was one of the first to really dive deep into this, right? Exactly. Eddington had this, well, really brilliant insight, actually. He was the one who first connected the arrow of time to entropy. Okay, entropy. So, like, my physics 101 is a little rusty. Remind me, what is entropy again? Basically, it's the measure of disorder or randomness in a system. Right, right. So, more entropy equals more disorder, more chaos. Got it. And Eddington's big idea was that over time, the entropy of the universe, well, it always increases. Hmm. So, is that, like, why my room always gets messy no matter how much I clean it? Is that entropy in action and therefore proof of the arrow of time? Well, your room is a bit more complicated than that because it's what we call an open system. It's constantly being affected by outside forces, you know, like you. But you are kind of getting at the core idea here. Okay, so maybe my room isn't the best example. Not exactly a closed system. But I get the concept. So, Eddington basically said that by looking at how entropy increases, we can actually see the arrow of time at work. Exactly. He even went so far as to say that if time were to run backwards, well, the world would just become completely nonsensical. Nonsensical. Okay, I like that. But what did he mean by that? Give me an example. Okay, sure. Imagine a glass shattering on the floor. We instinctively know that the glass breaks because it was dropped, right? Cause and effect, that's the key. Eddington was arguing that if you reverse the arrow of time, this whole cause and effect thing, it would get completely flipped on its head. A shattered glass would suddenly reassemble itself, you know, out of nowhere. Okay, yeah, I see what you mean. That'd be pretty weird to see a broken glass suddenly become whole again. Yeah. So, entropy and this whole cause and effect idea, they're like totally linked to how we perceive time moving forward. Precisely. But is entropy the only way to think about the arrow of time? Or are there other ways to look at it? You're actually right. There's a lot more to it than just entropy. You see, scientists have identified a number of different arrows of time, each with its own quirks, I guess you could say. But they all seem to be pointing in the same direction, that is, from the past to the future. Okay, now this is where things start to get really interesting. We have entropy, but what are some of these other arrows that are out there? Well, for starters, we have the thermodynamic arrow of time. And this is the one that's most closely tied to Eddington's whole entropy idea. In a nutshell, the thermodynamic arrow of time, it basically says that in an isolated system, entropy will always increase over time. Okay, so does that mean that the universe, like as a whole, is just constantly becoming more and more disordered? Well, that's the prevailing theory, yes. But it's important to remember that this idea of increasing entropy, it only applies to isolated systems. Okay, so isolated systems. And my room is not an isolated system because I'm messing it up. So I guess there's still hope for me, right? Uh-huh, exactly. Now, another arrow is the cosmological arrow of time. And this one, it points in the same direction as the universe's expansion. Okay, right. The universe is getting bigger all the time. So does that mean time itself is expanding too? That's a really great question. And honestly, it's one that scientists are still debating. Some theories suggest that as the universe keeps expanding, it's kind of inevitably moving toward a state of, well, they call it heat death. Heat death? Okay, I've never heard of that. What does it even mean? Like, does the universe just kind of fizzle out? Essentially, yes. But don't worry, that's all theoretical and it's billions and billions of years away, if it even happens at all. There are some physicists who think the cosmological arrow could actually reverse, which would lead to something called a big crunch, basically. The universe collapsing back in on itself. Okay, so the universe fizzling out or collapsing back in on itself. Got it. So lots of unknowns about what's going to happen to the universe in the end. But what other arrows should we be thinking about right now? Well, have you ever thought about how waves behave? Waves? Like in the ocean? Yeah, like in the ocean or even sound waves, light waves. Sure. Well, they always seem to radiate outwards, away from their source, right? Yeah, like ripples spreading out when you throw a rock in a pond. Right, exactly. And that's the basic idea behind the radiative arrow of time. It's all about how waves travel. And you know what's interesting? The equations that describe wave behavior, they actually allow for solutions where waves can travel inwards, but we almost never actually see that happening in the real world. Really? Yeah. Almost all the time we see waves traveling outwards, and that tells us something about the direction of time, too. So even the way waves behave gives us clues about time. Exactly. What else is there? Well, there's also the causal arrow of time. Causal. Hmm. This one's a bit more straightforward. Causes always come before effects. I mean, yeah, that makes sense. I can't really think of any examples where the effect happens before the cause. Exactly. And this whole principle of causality, it's fundamental to how we understand the world. If you tried to reverse the arrow of time, it would mean that cause and effect would get all jumbled up. The world would just become completely unpredictable, you know? Yeah, that would be a little scary, I think. So is the causal arrow basically saying that the reason we experience time moving forward is simply because that's the order in which things happen, first the cause and then the effect? Precisely. In fact, some physicists believe that the causal arrow of time might actually be the most fundamental arrow of them all, that it sort of underpins all the other arrows, in a way. Interesting. But of course, how exactly these different arrows relate to each other, that's still something that scientists are trying to figure out. Wow, it sounds like we've covered a lot of ground already. So we have thermodynamic, cosmological, radiative, and causal arrows of time, all pointing from past to future. But are there any arrows that, you know, don't follow this pattern? That's a great question, and one that takes us into some, well, some pretty mind-bending territory. Before we get to that, though, there's one more classic arrow we should talk about, the quantum arrow of time. Okay, quantum? Now we're talking. Tell me more about this quantum arrow. All right, so quantum mechanics, this is where we start looking at how things work at the atomic and subatomic level, and it's at this level that our everyday understanding of time really starts to break down. I can already feel my brain doing backflips. Sure. But okay, let's do this. Let's talk about the quantum arrow of time. For a long time, scientists believed that the laws that govern the quantum world, the laws of quantum mechanics, they were what we call time-symmetric. Basically what that means is they'd work the same whether time was moving forward or backward. However, some recent experiments have actually challenged this idea. Okay, hold on. Challenge this idea. What kind of experiments are we talking about here? Well, in 2019, there was this group of Russian scientists, and they actually used an IBM quantum computer to try and reverse the quantum arrow of time. Well, wait, they reversed time? Like, do they travel to the past or something? Uh-huh. No, no, no. It wasn't quite like that. They weren't reversing time for the entire universe or even, you know, a person or object. They were working with a very specific, very isolated quantum system, and they manipulated it in such a way that they actually managed to decrease the entropy of the system. So basically they made a tiny part of the quantum world run in reverse for a very short amount of time. Okay, so maybe no time travel just yet. But, I mean, it's still pretty incredible, right, to make part of the quantum world run in reverse? Yeah. What does this tell us about the arrow of time as a whole, like the big picture? Well, it suggests that the quantum arrow of time, it might not be a fundamental property of the universe, you know, something that's baked in from the start. Instead, it might be what we call an emergent property, meaning it arises from the interactions of many particles and the second law of thermodynamics. Okay, so the quantum arrow of time could be like a consequence of the thermodynamic arrow. Is that what you're saying? That's one way to look at it, yeah. And it also suggests that under very
