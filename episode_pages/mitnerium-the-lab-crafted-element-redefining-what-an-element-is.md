From the 1982 discovery at GSI to the speculative world where a stabilized Mitnerium could transform industry, medicine, and our understanding of matter.

## Transcript

Hey everyone, and welcome back for another deep dive. Glad to be here. Today we're going deep on Mitnerium. Ooh, Mitnerium. It's an element that even some serious science fans out there might not know a whole lot about. Yeah, that's right. You sent in some awesome material on this. Definitely. Including some excerpts from history and also the Mitnerium Wikipedia page. I'm ready to dive in. So it seems like you're ready for some serious chemistry today. For sure. All right, so let's get to it. What makes Mitnerium so special? For me, what's really fascinating about Mitnerium is that it kind of challenges what we even think an element is. Okay. Like we're not talking about something you dig up or find in a meteorite or something. Right. This is something that we create. Exactly. It's synthetic. Yeah. It only exists because we like figured out how to make it in a lab. Totally. Which I gotta say sounds a little bit sci-fi to me. It does have a certain mad scientist charm to it. Doesn't it? It does. So how do we even make Mitnerium? Well, the process involves smashing bismuth atoms with iron atoms. Whoa. At incredible speeds in a particle accelerator. Okay, hold on, smashing atoms. I need a visual here. Okay. What is that like? Yeah. So picture this. You have a stream of iron atoms just hurtling down a track at near the speed of light. Okay. And then bam, they collide with this target that's made of bismuth. Oh, wow. It's like a microscopic demolition derby, but with much higher stakes. Uh-huh. And when these atoms collide, sometimes just sometimes they fuse together and create something new. And that new thing is Mitnerium. Exactly, in this case. That is incredible. It is wild. And all of this was first done back in 1982 at the GSI in Germany. Yeah, that's right. But you know, something I thought was really interesting looking at all these sources is that there wasn't like this big drama that we often hear about with big science discoveries. Yeah, no controversy. Like, you know, who did what first and all that. Yeah, I think that speaks to the collaborative nature of the field. And maybe the daunting challenge of actually creating Mitnerium brought everybody together. That makes sense. I mean, you would have to work together on something like that. Definitely. But this whole, you know, lack of drama thing, I feel like it also might have to do with just how hard it is to study Mitnerium. Uh-huh. It turns out that this element is, well. Unstable. Yeah, a little on the unstable side for sure. It really is. So tell me about that. Mitnerium has 15 known isotopes. Okay. But they all decay really, really quickly. The most stable one, Mitnerium 278. Okay. It has a half-life of only eight seconds. Eight seconds. Eight seconds. Whoa. Yeah. So if you could hold a piece of Mitnerium in your hand, it would just disappear. Not disappear exactly. Oh, okay. It would transform into other elements through radioactive decay. Okay. Think of it like a rapidly melting ice cube. Got it. The ice itself doesn't vanish, but it changes its form. Okay, that makes sense. And that eight second half-life just means that after eight seconds, half of your Mitnerium would have decayed into other elements. Wow, that really puts things in perspective. Yeah, it does. So knowing all that, how do scientists even begin to figure out like what are Mitnerium's properties? That is the big question. Right, because you can't run tests on something that exists for like a few seconds. Exactly. You're absolutely right. It's a huge challenge, but scientists aren't completely in the dark. Okay. They can use the periodic table, which is like the roadmap of elements to help predict Mitnerium's behavior. Oh, interesting. You see elements in the same column often have similar chemical traits. Oh, so it's like saying, okay, if Mitnerium hangs out with this group of elements on the periodic table, it's probably gonna act like them. Exactly. That's actually pretty clever. It's a really good starting point. Yeah. And based on this, scientists predict that Mitnerium would probably be a solid metal at room temperature. Okay. And since it's in the same family as platinum, they think it might be dense and resistant to corrosion, just like platinum is. But there are also some predictions that Mitnerium might have unusual oxidation states. Okay. Meaning it could be a bit more reactive than its platinum cousins. Okay, but hold on, reactivity is one thing. I get how gold doesn't tarnish easily, but how does that even work with something that's so short-lived like Mitnerium? Right. If it decays so fast, can you even see those reactions? That's the million dollar question. Right. It's incredibly difficult to study the chemistry of something that disappears in seconds. Yeah. And that brings us to one of the biggest hurdles in Mitnerium research. Which is? Volatility. Okay. To really get a handle on its chemical reactions, you need compounds that can become gases at relatively low temperatures. Right, so they're trying to find a way to basically make Mitnerium float around? Kind of. So it can interact more easily. Exactly. That sounds really tricky. It is tricky. We're talking about manipulating matter at its most fundamental level here, and the challenges are immense. This is seriously mind-boggling to me. It is a very complex element. We have this element incredibly hard to make, vanishes in seconds. Uh-huh. And yet scientists are still determined to like figure out its secrets. Absolutely. I'm starting to understand why you said it challenges like the definition of what an element is. It really does. I mean, it raises questions about the limits of our understanding. Yeah. And the lengths that we'll go to to push those limits. So after all of this, why should we care about an element that basically exists for a few seconds? You know, Mitnerium represents more than just a box on the periodic table. Okay. It embodies our quest to unravel the mysteries of the universe. Hmm. Even when those mysteries are fleeting and incredibly challenging to study. So maybe it's less about what Mitnerium is right now and more about what it represents. Yeah. Like the potential... The potential for scientific discovery. For scientific discovery. Yes. Even in the face of what seems like impossible odds. Exactly. And who knows what doors might open if we could unlock its secrets. Speaking of unlocking secrets, there's one thing I keep coming back to. What's that? If we could somehow stabilize Mitnerium. Okay. What then? That is a fascinating question. Isn't it? One that leads us into a realm of speculation. Totally. What if we could create Mitnerium that stuck around a bit longer? Right. What impact would that have on our world? That's where it gets really interesting. It does. But I think we should save that conversation for later. I agree. Let's take a moment to appreciate how much we've already learned about this really elusive element. It's pretty incredible what we do know. It is. It really speaks to the ingenuity and dedication of scientists worldwide. You know, working atom by atom to piece together the story of Mitnerium. It's amazing. It is. All right, so we are going to take a quick break. That sounds good. And when we come back, we will discuss what a world with stabilized Mitnerium could look like. Can't wait. I'm really excited about this conversation. So stay with us. It really does feel like we're standing at the edge of this new frontier. Yeah. And Mitnerium is like our gateway. Just imagine the possibilities if we could somehow tame its fleeting existence. I am so hooked right now. Let's go down that rabbit hole. All right. Okay, so let's say hypothetically we could create Mitnerium that was stable. Okay. What kind of world are we talking about? Well, first let's consider those predicted properties we talked about before. Okay. Remember, it's likely to be a very dense, corrosion-resistant metal. Right. Perhaps even tougher than platinum. Right, we touched on that earlier. Are we talking like stronger, lighter materials? Yeah. Maybe revolutionizing construction or aerospace engineering? Exactly. Imagine spacecrafts built with Mitnerium alloys. Oh, wow. Capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of deep space travel. Yeah. Or skyscrapers that could endure earthquakes and extreme weather events. That's amazing to think about. It is pretty wild. But what about beyond like those big structural applications? Right. Could stabilized Mitnerium impact fields like medicine? It's certainly plausible. I mean, right now we use radioactive isotopes in medical imaging and cancer treatments. Right. But these isotopes have their limitations. Yeah. Imagine if we could harness Mitnerium's unique properties. Okay. Its potential for like targeted radiation therapy or even creating new diagnostic tools. That would be revolutionary. It would. It's like we're talking about rewriting the rules of what's possible in healthcare. Yeah, it's really exciting to think about. It is. And we're just scratching the surface here. Right. Who knows what kind of unforeseen applications might emerge once we can truly study and manipulate this element? Yeah. It's like having a brand new set of Legos. Okay. With completely unknown building potential. I like that analogy. Yeah. Okay, but let's be realistic for a sec. Okay. We've been talking about stabilizing Mitnerium like it's just a matter of flipping a switch. Is that a bit of a leap? You're right to bring us back down to Earth. Okay. Stabilizing Mitnerium is a monumental
