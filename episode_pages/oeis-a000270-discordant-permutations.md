## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive. We're your shortcut to getting up to speed on complex topics. We dig into the sources, pull out the key insights, and serve them up with, well, hopefully some surprising facts and maybe a bit of intellectual humor. That's the plan. And today, we're diving into a really interesting corner of the online encyclopedia of integer sequences. This is especially for you number theory students listening in. Our mission today is a deep dive into OEIS sequence A0000270. It used to be known as Discordant Permutations. Right. And our goal is to really unpack what makes A000057 tick. Not just the definition, but, you know, why it's interesting, how it connects elsewhere in math, and some of the historical quirks around it. Discordant Permutations. I like that name. It sounds intriguing, doesn't it? Hints at some complexity. It does. So we're going to explore what makes them unique, their definition, some interesting properties, and maybe uncover a little mathematical detective work. Let's get started. Okay, so let's start with that name, Discordant Permutations. It comes from the 1973 Handbook of Integer Sequences by Sloan. But what does that actually mean? What is a Discordant Permutation here? Well, okay, the formal definition, and this is thanks to William P. Oryx's clarification in 2020, is that for n greater than or equal to 2, A n counts the permutations of the numbers 1 up to n plus 1 that are discordant with two specific reference permutations. One is just the identity, you know, 1, 2, 3. Right, everything in its place. Exactly. And the other one is a specific type. It has one element fixed, a one cycle, and the other n elements form one big cycle, an n cycle. Whoa, okay. That's quite specific. Can you break down discordant a bit more and maybe refresh us on one cycle and n cycle? Sure thing. So discordant basically means they don't match up. If you compare your permutation to one of the reference ones, discordant means no element is in the same position. Like a derangement, sort of? Yeah. But against two things? Kind of, yeah. It's about avoiding fixed points relative to those two specific structures simultaneously. Now, the cycles. A one cycle is just an element mapping to itself, like 1 stays as 1. Got it. And an n cycle means the other n elements all swap around in one continuous loop, like 2 goes to 3, 3 goes to 4, and the last one goes back to 2, one big circle. Okay, okay. So we're looking for arrangements that avoid matching both the everything stays put pattern and this one thing stays put, the rest cycle pattern. Precisely. That's the core idea. And that specificity leads to some fascinating math. You mentioned a formula, a recurrence relation. Yes, a key one is A n, B n plus 1 plus B n plus B n 1 for n a's 2. And the B i there, those are the menage numbers, OEIS A 000179. That's them, the famous menage numbers. Okay, I remember those. That's the problem about seating couples around a table so no one sits next to their partner, right? Exactly, that classic problem. They count a sort of constrained derangement on a circle. So, how on earth do dinner party seating arrangements connect to permutations being discordant with these two specific patterns? Is there some hidden structural link? That's a great question. And yes, that's what's so fascinating here. The fact that this sequence, A n, defined by discordance with two permutations, can be built from menage numbers, it suggests a deep underlying combinatorial structure that connects these seemingly very different problems. It shows how abstract patterns repeat across mathematics. It's really quite elegant. It really is. So, what are the first few terms? You mentioned the formula starts at n 2. Right, the sequence starts at 0, 1, 8, 1, 1, then 8, 2, 0. Okay. Yeah, 8, 2, 0, then 8, 3, 3, 8, 4, 16, 8, 5, 95, 6, 72. It grows pretty fast. But that 8, 2, 0 is immediately interesting. Definitely. But wait, you started with 8, 0 and 8, 1 being 1. Is that consistent with the formula? And isn't there some debate about that at 8, 0? Ah, yes. You're right on both counts. The formula A n, B n plus 1 plus B n plus B n 1 is given for n a's 2. The 8, 0, 1 and 8, 1 are given as starting values. And yes, there is a historical puzzle around 8, 0. Okay, tell us about that. It sounds like the kind of thing you find digging through old papers. It is. So Jacques Tuchard, who did early work on this, has a 1953 paper in Script of Mathematica. A table in there seems to imply a 0, 1. Okay. But in an earlier 1934 paper in Comptes Rendus, an equation he gives, equation 3, actually implies a 0, 1. Huh. So his own work wasn't consistent. Apparently not on this specific point. And William Orrick pointed out later, in 2020, that other formulas in the 1953 paper itself actually give incorrect results. Unless you assume a 0 is really 0. So why does the OEIS entry list a 0, 1? Well, this is where the OEIS acts partly as a historical record. The entry explicitly states it keeps a 0, 1, specifically to agree with that table in Tuchard's 1953 paper. Even if it seems mathematically iffy, based on other evidence. Exactly. It raises this interesting question, you know, how do we handle these historical discrepancies? OEIS chose to preserve the link to that specific publication, which is a valid curatorial choice, even if mathematically 8i might make more sense in the context of the formulas. It shows the tension between history and consistency. That is fascinating, like mathematical archaeology. Okay, so we have the theory, the history. Let's make it concrete. Can we walk through an example? Like, why is A2? Sure, so A2 relates to permutations of n plus 1 plus 3, so permutations of 1, 2, 3. The identity is 1, 2, 3. The other reference permutation, 1 cycle, 2 cycle, would be, say, 1, 3, 2, fixing 1, swapping 2 and 3. Okay. Oric explains there are simply no permutations of 1, 2, 3 that are discordant with both 1, 2, 3 and 1, 3, 2. You can check them. 2, 1, 3 matches 1, 3, 2 at position 3. 2, 3, 1 matches 1, 2, 3 at position 1. 3, minus matches 1, 2, 3 at position 2. 3, 2, 1 matches 1, 3, 2 at position 2. None work, hence A2, 0. Okay, that makes sense. What about A3? Right, so for A3, we look at permutations of 4, so 12, 3, 4. The identity is 12, 3, 4. The other reference, 1 cycle, 3 cycle, could be the 3, 4, fixing 1, cycling 2, 3, 4, 2. Okay. And Oric lists the three permutations of 12, 3, 4 that are discordant with both 12, 3, 4 and 13, 4, 2. They are 24, 13, 34, 21, and 4, 1, 23, only those three. Let's check one. So 24, 13 doesn't match 1, 2, 3, 4. No. Does it match 13, 4, 2? No. Okay, I see. Exactly. And interestingly, to loop back to the A0 thing, Tuchard's 1953 paper also mentions a calculation for permutations discordant with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 1, 3, 2, 5, 4. Okay, that's M4. Right. He uses an expression involving a 4 plus a 0. The actual number of such permutations is 16. Now we know A4, 16. So for the expression A4 plus A0 to equal 16, A0 must be 0, which again supports the idea that maybe the A0, 1 from the table was, let's say, less consistent with his own formulas. Wow, okay. It's like this little mystery woven into the sequence, these discordant permutations. They seem to have layers. Are there other ways mathematicians look at them, like generating functions or other formulas? Oh, absolutely. There's often more than one way to describe a sequence. Vladeta Jovic provided a generating function for A000270 back in 2007. Right, the GF packs the whole sequence into one function. Exactly. It's a powerful tool for analysis. And then
