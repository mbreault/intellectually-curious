## Transcript

Welcome back. It's time for another deep dive into the lives of the Lucasian professors of mathematics. Always a pleasure. This is, I think, our 12th episode? It is 12th. And today we're going to talk about the 11th holder of the Lucasian chair, Charles Babbage. Babbage? Who is often called the father of the computer. Yes. Quite a legacy for someone working in the early 19th century. Yeah. I mean, he was working well before, obviously, the technology that we would think of when we think of computers today, but so many of the core ideas that we associate with computing today were really present in his work. And to make it even more intriguing, his most ambitious projects, they were never completed during his lifetime. That's right. Some of them are still being worked on. Yeah. So let's start with his early life. Even his birthplace is a bit of a mystery. Yeah. There's some debate about whether he was born in London or Teignmouth in Devon, but most sources point to London in 1791. What is clear is his early passion for mathematics, which was nurtured by a robust library at Homewood Academy, where he went to school. And this passion ultimately led him to Cambridge. But his time there, interestingly, was marked by some frustration. Really? Yeah. That's surprising to hear because you think future Lucasian professor. Right. You think he would be, you know, top of his class and everything. But his grasp of mathematics was already quite advanced when he arrived at Cambridge, and he found the instruction there didn't quite meet his needs. He was already delving into the works of continental mathematicians like Lagrange and Marie Agnese. There's even some mystery surrounding his graduation in 1814. He didn't graduate with honors, and there's speculation that his thesis defense might have been a little bit controversial. Oh, a little bit of a rebel even then. Potentially. Yeah. So what happened after Cambridge? Did he immediately step into a teaching role? Not exactly. His career path wasn't exactly linear. He collaborated with John Herschel, another, you know, luminary in the scientific world, on electrodynamics. Specifically, they were studying Eragos rotations. Have you heard of those? I have not. So it involves a rotating copper disc and a magnetic needle. And their work on this contributed to what we now understand as eddy current theory. Oh, okay. Which describes the circular currents that are induced in conductors by changing magnetic fields. So we see his mathematical mind applied to different areas of science. Yes. And this pattern continues. He even delved into actuarial science, attempting to establish an insurance company. Really? After acquiring some unpublished actuarial tables. Interesting. He saw a need for more accurate and reliable data in this field, and that's a theme that will become central to his later work. Okay. And I guess this focus on accuracy leads us to his involvement with the Royal Astronomical Society. Precisely. He was a founding member of the society in 1820, driven by this need for standardized astronomical calculations and improved data circulation. He recognized how human error could creep into these very complex calculations. And in fact, while working with Herschel, again, on recalculating tables for the nautical almanac, they discovered discrepancies, which really solidified Babbage's concern about human error. Wow. So a practical problem sparks a groundbreaking invention. I like that. That's a great way to put it. This is where the difference engine comes in. So the Royal Astronomical Society needed more accurate astronomical tables. And Babbage envisioned a machine that could automate these calculations and eliminate human error in the process. It's amazing. Can you explain how the difference engine was supposed to work? I mean, it sounds very complex for the technology available at the time. It was, and building it proved incredibly challenging. But the concept is ingenious. So the difference engine was designed to calculate values of polynomial functions automatically, using a method called the method of finite differences. So imagine a table where each row represents a specific value of x for your polynomial. And each column represents a higher order difference. So the engine would start with a few initial values and then use repeated addition to calculate subsequent values, essentially automating the process of constructing a difference table. So instead of manually calculating each value, the machine would churn through these additions to arrive at the result. That's it. And by using this method, the difference engine could calculate, you know, very complex polynomial values with high accuracy, and all without requiring the complex machinery that would be needed for multiplication or division. So it's incredible that he even conceived of this. But I understand that actually building it was a monumental task. It was. He faced numerous challenges, including, you know, just securing funding from the British government. He also had a very complex relationship with the skilled engineer, Joseph Clement, who was tasked with actually constructing the machine. I see. Were any parts of the difference engine ever built? Yes. So some prototype parts survived. And what's fascinating is that a functioning difference engine number two, based on Babbage's designs, was actually built in the late 20th century. Wow. Proving that his concept was sound, even if the technology of his time couldn't fully realize it. Even a printer that was designed for the original difference engine has been constructed, highlighting the meticulousness of Babbage's plans. That's amazing. So while the difference engine never came to fruition during Babbage's lifetime, it still solidified his reputation as a visionary thinker. Absolutely. And this is really just the beginning of his journey into computing. Because his work on the difference engine led him to conceive of something even more ambitious, something that truly foreshadowed the modern computer, the analytical engine. Yeah, the analytical engine, it really was a revolutionary concept. Unlike the difference engine, which was designed for specific calculations, the analytical engine was intended to be a general-purpose computing machine. So what were some of the key features that made it so different from the difference engine? And, you know, how did it really foreshadow modern computers? Well, there are several key features that really stand out. First, it was to be programmed using punched cards. Punched cards? Yeah. Babbage borrowed this idea from the Jacquard loom, which used punched cards to control patterns in woven textiles. Oh, wow. That's so interesting. This link between two seemingly unrelated fields, textiles and computation. It is. It really highlights Babbage's ability to draw inspiration from diverse sources. And it gets even more interesting when you consider the other features he envisioned. The analytical engine had separate data and program memory, instruction-based operation, conditional jumps, and an I.O. unit. Wow. All hallmarks of modern computers. Exactly. So he essentially laid out this blueprint for the computer as we know it, even though, as we've said, the technology of his time wasn't ready for such a complex machine. Exactly. The analytical engine remained a concept, but its design has solidified Babbage's place in computing history. And there's another key figure in this story, Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron's daughter. Ah, yes, Lovelace. Her work with Babbage is often considered a landmark in the history of computing. What were her contributions to the analytical engine project? Well, Lovelace was a brilliant mathematician who collaborated very closely with Babbage. While there's some debate about the extent of her contributions, she is credited with developing an algorithm for the analytical engine to calculate Bernoulli numbers. This work is often cited as the first computer program, and it demonstrates her deep understanding of the engine's capabilities. So even though a formal programming language didn't exist yet, her work helped to conceptualize how the analytical engine could be used to solve these complex mathematical problems. Precisely. And she also played a crucial role in translating and promoting the analytical engine project, helping to ensure that Babbage's ideas reached a wider audience. But even with Lovelace's contributions, the analytical engine was never built. Right. So what happened to Babbage's work after that? Did it kind of fall into obscurity, or did it have this immediate impact on the development of computing? Sadly, Babbage's work did fade into relative obscurity for a time. It wasn't until the 20th century when the field of computing was really taking off that his contributions were rediscovered. I imagine that was a significant moment. Oh, absolutely. People were astonished to find that Babbage had envisioned so many key computing concepts over a century earlier. This rediscovery fueled renewed interest in his work, and it even led to the Plan 28 project, which aims to finally build the analytical engine based on his original plans. So Babbage's vision might actually be realized, albeit over 150 years later. It's amazing. That's a real testament to the power of his ideas. It is. It is. But Babbage's impact wasn't limited to computing. His work on industrial organization and management, captured in his book on the economy of machinery and manufacturers, also had a lasting impact. Oh, yeah. In that book, he examined factories in detail and proposed ways to optimize industrial production. He was essentially an early pioneer of operations research. That's right. One of his key observations was what's now called the Babbage principle. He noticed that skilled workers often spent time on tasks below their skill level, which led to inefficiency. So how did he propose to solve that problem? Well, he argued for a more effective division of labor where high-skilled tasks were assigned only to high-paid workers, which really aligns with a lot of modern management principles that focus on specialization and maximizing employee skills. And it's a concept that's highly relevant today, especially with the rise of automation and AI. You know, we're seeing
