## Description

A deep dive into Unidentified Submerged Objects (USOs): their long history, competing scientific theories, and official investigations. From Columbusâ€™s legends to recent AARO analyses, we explore what makes underwater mysteries so hard to pin downâ€”and how researchers separate misidentifications from genuine anomalies.

## Transcript

Hey everyone and welcome to another deep dive. Today we're going to be taking a look at all the research you sent in on USOs. Unidentified submerged objects. We'll be covering historical accounts, scientific theories, and even government investigations into these underwater enigmas. That's right. And what makes this topic so interesting is the sheer vastness of the unknown. Yeah, we often say we know more about the surface of the moon than our own ocean floor. Exactly. And that makes it the perfect place for these mysterious objects. Okay, so before we go any further, let's make sure we're all on the same page. What exactly are USOs and how are they different from those other mysterious objects we hear about, you know, the UAPs? Good point. Essentially a USO is any unidentified object that's detected underwater. So it's like a subset of UAPs, since UAPs could be anything unidentified in the air or space. Exactly. But it gets a little more complicated when you consider that some objects seem to be able to transition between the air and water. Oh wow, so sometimes they're diving in and sometimes they're flying out. Talk about a mysterious commute. So let's dive into some of those recent USO encounters. Anything from the research really stand out? Well, one that immediately come to my mind is Congressman Tim Burchett's report. He's mentioned a USO moving at incredible speeds underwater. He's been pretty vocal about this, claiming he got the intel from an admiral. Hundreds of miles per hour underwater. That's pretty mind boggling. It is. And what about that video from 2013, the one near Puerto Rico? Didn't the government release that? I remember it seemed to show something strange interacting with the water. Yeah, the All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, released that footage. Oh, AARO. They're the government organization that investigates UAPs, right? That's right, including the ones that operate underwater, like our USOs here. And their analysis suggested that the object's speed and how it was flying weren't necessarily outside the realm of known physics. But, you know, it's a good example of how limited sensor data can be. Right. Makes it hard to say for sure what something is. So it seems like there's a lot of room for misinterpretation out there. But even with those limitations, it sounds like AARO is taking this whole thing seriously. What exactly is their role? I mean, what are they trying to do? Well, their main mission is to minimize what they call technological and intelligence surprise, you know, when it comes to UAPs. So that includes these underwater objects too. Think of them as kind of like watchdogs, constantly analyzing data, investigating reports, trying to figure out what these objects are. So they're keeping an eye on things. Exactly. And it's not just conspiracy theories anymore. They even present an annual report to Congress. So this is definitely on the government's radar. Okay, so it's official government business. That's pretty interesting. But before we get too deep into the present day, I know you mentioned some historical USO reports in the research. Have people been seeing these things for a long time? Or is this a more recent phenomenon? Oh, no. The history goes way back. In fact, one of the earliest potential sightings, possible USO sightings, comes from Christopher Columbus. No way. Christopher Columbus, we're going that far back. Yeah, back in 1492, he describes this mysterious light he saw underwater while he was sailing through the Sargasso Sea. Wow, now that's a historical deep dive. So we've got Columbus, we've got the Navy, we've got this dedicated government office. The mystery of USOs has captivated people for a long time. It has. And speaking of the Navy, there was that famous incident with the USS Trepang submarine. Oh, yeah. In 1971. Under the Arctic ice. What happened there? So the Trepang crew reported this high-speed object moving under the ice. They even managed to get some photographs. It's one of those cases that really gets you thinking because it's trained observers, you know, in a very sensitive environment. And we still don't have definitive answers about what they saw. So we have eyewitness accounts that go back centuries. But are there any official records of these events? Like a central place where all this information is collected? There is. The National Archives, they actually hold a huge collection of UFO and UAP records. Documents, photos, audio recording, all kinds of stuff. So it's not just hearsay, it's documented history. It's like a goldmine for anyone who wants to really dig into this topic. Wow, a goldmine. So we've established that USOs aren't a new thing. They've been reported for centuries and the government's actively investigating them. But what about scientists? Are there any theories out there about what these USOs might be? Is it all just speculation or are there serious researchers trying to figure this out? Oh, there's definitely a range of hypotheses out there. Some scientists think we could be looking at really advanced technology, maybe secret government projects, or even something developed by another country. Okay, so like underwater spy tech? Maybe, yeah. Others propose even more exotic explanations, like extraterrestrial origins or even interdimensional origins. Extraterrestrial origins, now you're speaking my language. But seriously, are there any scientific tools or methods they're using to investigate these underwater objects? Because it seemed like the ocean would be a pretty challenging environment to study, wouldn't it? It is, but we're not totally in the dark. Researchers are using a variety of technologies to explore the ocean depths, you know, trying to gather data on these objects. We've got sonar, underwater drones, even satellite imagery sometimes. Okay, so it sounds like we're starting to lift the veil a little bit on this underwater world. But given how challenging it is to explore the ocean, what are some of the biggest obstacles that researchers face when trying to identify these objects? What makes investigating USOs so difficult? Well, I mean, the ocean is vast and deep and dark. And those USOs don't exactly make things easy for us. They can be pretty unpredictable, appearing and disappearing. And even when we do manage to detect something, it's not always easy to figure out what we're looking at. Right, right. And it can be hard to even get down there in the first place. You know, in the research you mentioned the Autonomous Benthic Explorer, or ABE for short. That was a real game changer, wasn't it? It was. ABE was the first truly autonomous underwater vehicle. Yeah, and it paved the way for a lot of the technology we use today, didn't it? Exactly. ABE proved that we could explore the deep ocean without needing a human to actually be there. Right, so no more diving suits and those old school submarines. Exactly. Today we have these amazing underwater robots that can map the seafloor, collect samples, take high resolution pictures and videos. It's incredible. Wow. So we really do have eyes and hands down there in the deep sea. We do. That's amazing. But even with all this incredible technology, I imagine there are still limitations. What are some of the biggest challenges you've come across in your research into USOs? Well, the ocean is a huge place. I mean, it covers over 70% of the planet's surface. And a lot of it is really deep. Yeah, so trying to find anything specific down there must be like searching for a needle in a haystack. It is. And it's not just any haystack. It's a haystack that's constantly moving and changing. Right, full of distractions. Exactly. And then there's the pressure. The deeper you go, the more intense the pressure gets. It takes incredibly strong and sophisticated technology to even survive down there. Yeah, I can't even imagine. And it's pitch black down there, isn't it? After a certain depth, the sunlight just doesn't reach. So how do researchers see what they're doing? Well, sonar is a big help. It uses sound waves to detect objects and create images of the underwater environment. It's an amazing tool for exploring the deep ocean, but it does have limitations. Like what? Well, the sonar readings can be distorted by the water conditions. And sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between a natural formation and something that might be, you know, anomalous. Oh, right. So even when you pick something up on sonar, it's not always a sure thing. Exactly. That can be tricky. And speaking of tricky, you mentioned that a lot of reported USO sightings can actually be explained away as something totally normal. Just misidentified objects or natural phenomena. What are some examples of things that people might mistake for USOs? Well, one classic example is bioluminescence. You know, when marine organisms emit light. Oh, right. Fireflies of the sea. Exactly. They can create these patterns that could easily be mistaken for a USO, especially in low light. I see. And I bet schools of fish, whales, or even unusual currents could cause some confusion too, right? Absolutely. All of those can create strange sonar readings or visual effects that could seem anomalous at first glance. Right. So it's like a giant game of underwater Where's Waldo? Trying to spot the unusual amongst all the everyday ocean activity. That's a great way to put it. And that's why a deep understanding of marine biology and oceanography is so crucial for anyone researching USOs. I could see that. You have to be able to rule out the known before you can even start to consider the unknown. So it sounds like there's a lot of careful detective work involved. But even when you've eliminated all those conventional explanations, what are some of the challenges you face in actually trying to identify what a USO is? Well, one of the biggest challenges is just that our technology and our scientific understanding are constantly evolving. So there could
