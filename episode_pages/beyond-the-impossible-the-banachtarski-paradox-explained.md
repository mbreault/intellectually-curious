## Description

An accessible dive into a mathematical illusion: a solid ball can be cut and reassembled into two copies of itself. Weâ€™ll explore the Banachâ€“Tarski paradox, the Axiom of Choice, non-measurable sets, and what this means for our intuition about volume and infinity.

## Transcript

All right, buckle up for this one, folks. You've sent us a bunch of sources on the Banach-Tarski Paradox and... It's a doozy. It really is. It's like, imagine this. You take a solid ball, like a billiard ball. Okay. Cut it up into pieces. Uh-huh. And then you reassemble those pieces, just like a puzzle, but you end up with two identical balls. That's the paradox in a nutshell. It sounds impossible, right? Like you're getting something for nothing. It totally does. It feels like we're breaking some fundamental law of physics, you know? Well, in a way we are, but not in the physical world. The Banach-Tarski Paradox is a mathematical statement, not something you can actually do with a real ball and a saw. So then what are we talking about? If it's not about a real ball, what's getting doubled? We're talking about abstract sets of points. These sets are incredibly complex and infinitely scattered, so they don't behave like the solid objects we're used to. Okay, so this is where my brain starts to get a little fuzzy. How can you even double something, even theoretically, without actually adding anything new? Right. Well, the key is in how these sets are constructed and rearranged. Think of it like this. Imagine you're measuring the coastline of Britain. The closer you zoom in, the more details you see, and the longer the coastline appears to become, right? I see where you're going with this. Non-measurable sets, like the ones in the Banach-Tarski Paradox, are kind of similar. Their size is ill-defined because of this infinite complexity. So they don't really have a volume we can measure in the usual way. Exactly. And this is where our normal intuition about volume breaks down. The paradox uses this kind of loophole to allow for something that seems impossible in our everyday experience. So were there any hints, any earlier discoveries that suggested something like this could even be possible? Before Banach and Tarski, I mean. Yeah, actually. There's a concept called Hausdorff's Paradox. This was discovered back in 1914, and it involved a similar kind of decomposition, but with the surface of a sphere. So Hausdorff's Paradox was like a precursor, a hint that things can get really weird when you combine set theory and geometry. Precisely. It laid some of the groundwork for the later discovery of the Banach-Tarski Paradox. But what really makes the Banach-Tarski Paradox work is something called the Axiom of Choice. The Axiom of Choice. That sounds pretty important. Can you explain what that is? It's one of the fundamental building blocks of set theory, but it's also led to some of the most mind-boggling results in math. So infinite sets, non-measurable objects, and now the Axiom of Choice. This is getting pretty wild. Can you break down the paradox a little further? How do we actually get from these abstract concepts to doubling a ball? Sure. So the whole proof is quite complex, but we can break it down into four key steps. The first step involves something called a paradoxical decomposition of a free group. Okay, free group. That sounds like a whole other can of worms. Can you give us a simple explanation, a quick ELI5? All right. Imagine a set of instructions, you know, like steps in a recipe. A free group is like that, except you can combine these instructions in any order without changing the outcome. Like rotating a square 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. It's free because there are no restrictions on how you combine those rotations. Now imagine splitting this group of instructions into subsets and rearranging them, kind of like shuffling letters in a word to create two identical sets of those original instructions. So we're essentially playing a mathematical word game with rotations. Kind of. And that brings us to step two, finding the free group in 3D rotations. So it turns out there's a group of rotations in 3D space that acts just like the free group we were talking about. Okay, so we found a way to apply our abstract rotation game to an actual three-dimensional object. Exactly. And that's where things get really interesting. Step three is called extending to the sphere's surface. Since our group of rotations works on the surface of a sphere, we could apply that same paradoxical decomposition from step one to that surface. Hold on, are you saying that we can double the surface of a sphere using these rotations? Yep, that's exactly what I'm saying. And the final step from surface to solid ball is where we extend that decomposition inward to include the whole ball, except for the very center point, which needs special handling. Wow. So we've gone from abstract groups to doubling a solid ball. It's mind-blowing how these seemingly simple steps lead to such a counterintuitive result. But can we stop there? Can we do this with more than just two copies? That's where the Banach-Tarski paradox gets really wild. Yeah. You can theoretically make any finite number of copies of the original ball, or even an infinite number of copies. Hold on, infinite copies? That's just crazy. But this has to be purely theoretical, right? We can't actually build a machine to churn out infinite balls. You're right. It's purely theoretical. The paradox is really a statement about the strange behavior of infinity and how our normal intuition about volume just completely breaks down. So no duplicating gold bars or solving world hunger with this paradox, huh? Afraid not. But it does raise an interesting question. Does something have to be physically constructible to be considered real? Or is mathematical existence a different kind of reality? That's a really deep question. We've gone from doubling a ball to questioning the nature of reality itself. In part two, we'll explore more of the implications of this wild paradox and delve deeper into the axiom of choice. Stay tuned. Welcome back. So last time we left off with this mind-blowing concept. You can theoretically create infinite copies of a ball just using rotations and a little set theory magic. It's still hard to wrap my head around that. It makes me wonder, though, if we're talking about infinite copies, doesn't that mean we're creating something out of nothing? I can see why you'd think that, but the paradox isn't about creating matter from thin air. It's more like a mathematical sleight of hand. Remember those non-measurable sets, those infinitely complex objects whose size we can't define in the normal way? Yeah, they're the key to this whole thing, right? Right. The paradox kind of exploits this ambiguity to create this illusion of doubling, but there's no actual new volume being created. So it's like those optical illusions where you rearrange the pieces to make it look like there's more, but you haven't actually added any new area. That's a good analogy. The Banach-Tarski paradox is kind of like a mathematical illusion, playing tricks on our perception of volume. Okay, so it's not magic, but it's still pretty wild. Yeah. You mentioned the axiom of choice as a crucial part of this. Can you tell me more about that? Sure. The axiom of choice has a pretty fascinating history in math, kind of controversial, too. It's one of the fundamental axioms of set theory, and basically it says that given any collection of sets that aren't empty, you can always choose one element from each set. So like if I have a bunch of baskets of fruit, I can always pick one fruit from each basket. That seems pretty straightforward. Right. For finite sets, it's no big deal. But when we're talking about infinite sets, things can get weird. The axiom of choice lets us make choices even when there's no clear rule for how to do it, and that leads to some really unexpected results. Like the ability to double a ball without creating new volume. Exactly. The Banach-Tarski paradox relies on the fact that we're dealing with these non-measurable sets, which are only possible because of the axiom of choice. Can you give us a clearer picture of what a non-measurable set is? It's still a bit fuzzy for me. Okay, so imagine you have a bag of marbles, and you want to divide them into two piles. Normally, you could split them evenly, or maybe one pile has a few more than the other, right? Right. But with non-measurable sets, it's like trying to divide the marbles in a way that makes it impossible to say how many are in each pile. They don't have a defined size in the way we usually think about it. So it's like they break the rules of how we measure things. Exactly. And that's where the axiom of choice comes in. It allows for these strange sets that don't follow the usual rules of measurement. So the axiom of choice is like a gateway to a whole new world of mathematical objects that we can't even visualize or measure directly. Yeah, that's a good way to put it. But if these sets are so strange, are they actually important? Or are they just mathematical curiosities? It's a good question. Mathematicians have been debating that for a while. While they might seem like just curiosities, non-measurable sets are actually really important in a lot of areas of math, like analysis, topology, and even probability theory. Wow, so they have real implications. Yeah, they help us understand the foundations of math and the limits of what we can measure and quantify. They force us to think beyond our everyday ideas about size and number. This is making me appreciate abstract math in a whole new way. It's like exploring a hidden world with completely different rules. Are there other paradoxes like this one? Other things that challenge our assumptions about math and reality? Definitely. You might think that something like the Banach-Tarski Paradox could only happen in three dimensions, right? Yeah, it seems that way
