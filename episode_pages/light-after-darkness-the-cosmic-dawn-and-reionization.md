## Description

A Deep Dive in the Science Corner, where we unravel how the first stars and galaxies lit up the universe. We explore the physics of Lyman-continuum photons, the escape fraction, and the contenders for the ionizing sources, and how JWST, ALMA, and other observatories help reconstruct the timeline from roughly z â‰ˆ 10 to z â‰ˆ 6. Join us as we connect the dark ages to the ionized, structured cosmos we observe today.

## Transcript

Welcome back to the deep dive. Today we're jumping into quite a fundamental topic as part of our science corner series. We are indeed. We're tackling cosmic reionization. Reionization. It sounds important, maybe a bit intimidating, but I gather it's basically when the universe sort of woke up. That's a great way to put it. Yeah, when the lights came on after a very long dark period. We've got quite a bit of material here, dissertation bits, research papers to help us unpack it. Okay, love the lights on idea. So let's set this up. We're talking after the Big Bang, after things cooled enough for neutral atoms to form recombination, right? Around redshift 1100. Exactly. And at that point, the universe was filled with this uniform fog of neutral gas, mostly hydrogen, some helium. Neutral, meaning electrons attached to protons. Correct. And crucially, there weren't really any sources of light yet. No stars, no galaxies. So people like Martin Rees called this the dark ages. Dark ages. Not because light couldn't travel, but because nothing was making light yet. Precisely. It was transparent, just empty of light sources. Okay, so when did the darkness start to lift? That happened when gravity pulled enough matter together to form the very first stars and then the first small galaxies. That's the beginning of what we call the cosmic dawn. Cosmic dawn. Okay, first light. And reionization follows the dawn. It's really the culmination of the dawn. See, those first stars and galaxies started pumping out light, really energetic light. And this light started doing something to that neutral gas fog. Yes, it started breaking those neutral atoms apart again, stripping the electrons off the protons in the gas between the galaxies, the intergalactic medium, the IGM. Ah, so it was ionization, because it was ionized right after the Big Bang, became neutral, and then got ionized again? Exactly. You got it. And the key here is the type of light. It had to be highly energetic photons. You mentioned Lyman continuum, or LIC, radiation in the notes. That's the stuff. To knock an electron off a hydrogen atom, you need a photon with at least 13.6 electron volts of energy. That corresponds to wavelengths shorter than 912 angstroms. So anything less energetic just bounces off or doesn't do the job? Right. LIC radiation is specifically the light above that energy threshold. And reionization happened when these first galaxies were producing LIC photons faster than the electrons and protons in the IGM could find each other and recombine back into neutral atoms. So the ionization rate overtook the recombination rate? Right. Like filling a leaky bucket faster than it drains. That's a decent analogy, yeah. The bucket of the universe filled up with ionized gas. And this was an instant. Right, you mentioned time frame. Yeah, it seems to have happened over quite a stretch, roughly between redshift Z of about 10 down to Z of 6. In terms of time after the Big Bang? Z10 is maybe 480 million years after the Big Bang, and Z6 is closer to 900 million years. So a few hundred million years for this whole transformation. There's a figure 3.1 in the source material showing this timeline. Okay, a major universe-altering event over hundreds of millions of years. Why is understanding this specific period, reionization, so critical for cosmology? Well, fundamentally, it's tied directly to the formation of the very first things, stars and galaxies. The fact that reionization happened tells us those first structures must have formed and started shining by then. It's a direct consequence. And it wasn't just about changing the gas from neutral to ionized, right? It had knock-on effects. Oh, absolutely. Ionizing the IGM dramatically changed the environment. It affected how and where neutral hydrogen existed, which almost certainly influenced how later generations of stars and larger galaxies formed. It sort of cleared the way for the universe we see today. Okay, it reshaped the cosmic landscape. So the big question then is, who or what actually did the reshaping? What were the sources powerful enough to ionize almost the entire universe? Based on, well, pretty much all the observational data and theoretical work we have, the main candidates are those early, high-redshift, star-forming galaxies. So, well, maybe not ordinary, but galaxies were the engines, not like exotic decaying particles or something. Galaxies are definitely the frontrunners. The sheer number of them forming seems to make them the most likely source. Now, the sources we looked at do mention it's still, you know, an active area. People discuss contributions from quasars, those super bright galactic centers with black holes. Right, AGN. Exactly, active galactic nuclei or even more exotic things. But the consensus leans towards galaxies doing the heavy lifting. Okay, if galaxies are the main suspects, the sources highlight this factor called the Lyman continuum escape fraction, FESC, or FESC. Sounds crucial. What is it? It's the critical number if galaxies did it. FESC is basically the percentage of those vital ionizing LIC photons produced inside a galaxy that actually managed to escape out of the galaxy into the IGM. Ah, so stars make the photons, but they might get absorbed by gas and dust within their home galaxy before they can get out. Precisely. A galaxy could be forming stars like crazy, producing tons of LIC photons, but if its FESC is effectively zero, none of that light gets out to help reionize the universe. It just heats up the gas inside the galaxy. Okay, so FESC is the leakage rate. Why is it so incredibly hard to measure this for the actual galaxies that were doing the work back then? Yeah, this is the real kicker, and it's highlighted in the papers. The very IGM that was being ionized, well, it was still mostly neutral during reionization, right? And neutral hydrogen is extremely good at absorbing LIC photons. So the photons that did escape the galaxy got absorbed by the intergalactic gas on their way out. Exactly. It's like trying to see a flashlight through incredibly thick fog. The fog itself blocks the light you're trying to see. Inouye and Iwata pointed this out years ago. We just can't directly detect the escaping LIC from the galaxies right in the thick of the reionization era because the universe itself was opaque to that specific light. The universe eats the evidence. Okay, that makes sense why it's tricky. It does, and because we can't measure it directly back then, there's still a lot of uncertainty about how high the average FESC needed to be. What kind of numbers are we talking about? Well, some studies suggest galaxies needed a pretty significant average leakage, maybe 10 to 30 percent, to get the job done. But others argue that maybe it was much lower, like less than 5 percent, if there were just a huge number of very faint galaxies contributing. It's a big unknown. Okay, so if we can't see the escaping light directly from the reionization-era galaxies, how do astronomers try to understand what they were like? What are telescopes like Hubble or ALMA looking for? We look for other properties, sort of indirect clues that might correlate with FESC or tell us about the conditions inside, like dust content. Less dust might mean easier escape. That's the thinking. And generally, these high-redshift galaxies seem to have less dust than nearby ones, which fits with them often looking very blue in ultraviolet light. Less dust may be easier for LIC to get out. But not always. No, there's definitely scatter. Some distant galaxies clearly do have significant dust, and that's where ALMA comes in, in the Atacama Large Millimeter Submillimeter Array. It can detect the faint heat glow from that dust, the thermal emission, and also certain emission lines in the far infrared. Okay, dust is one clue. What about how quickly they were forming stars? That must matter. Absolutely critical. Star formation activity is traced by the light from young, massive stars. They're the ones producing most of the LIC photons. How do we measure that way back then? Well, at lower redshifts, a common tracer is the high emission line. But for these really distant epoch of reionization galaxies, high gets redshifted way into the infrared, so we really need the power of JWST, the James Webb Space Telescope, to see it effectively. What about other lines, like Lyman Alpha? We hear about that one a lot. Ly is observable, yes, but it's complicated. It's what's called a resonant line, meaning Lyman photons scatter very easily off neutral hydrogen atoms, so the signal gets bounced around a lot within the galaxy, and it gets heavily absorbed by any remaining neutral gas in the IGM on its way here. Interpreting it is tricky. Ah, that same IGM fog problem again. Exactly, which is why astronomers also target far-infrared lines with ALMA, like C-tionized carbon at 158 microns, or O-III, doubly ionized oxygen at 88 microns. These aren't resonant and cut through the IGM much better. And what do those tell us? They trace star formation too, but the relationship seems different back then. The sources mention that the link between C-type brightness and star formation rate has way more scatter at high redshift than it does locally, suggests a wider variety of conditions, maybe. Interesting. And don't those lines also tell us about metallicity, the amount of heavier elements? Yes, they're sensitive to that too. Metallicity, the abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, affects how stars evolve and the kind of radiation they produce. Lower metallicity stars might produce a harder radiation field, more high-energy photons.
