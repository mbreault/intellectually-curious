## Description

In this Deep Dive Science Corner, we trace how our memories are stored in the brain. From the old dream of a grandmother cell to the discovery of Jennifer Aniston cells and the idea of sparse coding, we explore how abstract concepts are represented, how memories form and are retrieved, and what iconic cases like HM teach us about the brainâ€™s memory circuitry.

## Transcript

Welcome to the Deep Dive, your shortcut to being truly well-informed. Now this is part of our Science Corner series, and it's really designed for the intellectually curious listener, which, well, we know is you. Today we're embarking on a pretty fascinating journey, I think. Our mission is to explore the very architecture of our memories. We want to tackle one of neuroscience's most intriguing and frankly debated questions. How are concepts of the world, you know, how are they actually stored in the brain? Is there like a dedicated neuron for every single idea? Or is it more like a sprawling distributed network? We'll dive into the history, a huge discovery, and how our understanding is, well, it's rapidly evolving. And I'm joined by an expert who will guide us through all these intricate details. So to really get into this, let's start with that foundational question neuroscientists have wrestled with for, what, decades? How are memories truly held in our brains? For a long time, one theory was discussed with a mix of intrigue and maybe amusement. The idea of a grandmother cell. It's fascinating, actually, how deeply rooted this concept is. If you go way back, late 19th century, William James was already amusing about pontifical cells. Pontifical cells. Yes, essentially a kind of singular high-level neuron where consciousness or maybe a complex idea might be located. Sort of the peak of the hierarchy. Then much later, 1969, neuroscientist Jerry Lettvin gave this rather famous fictional lecture at MIT. Fictional? Yes, he spun this tale about a neurosurgeon, Akaki Akakievich, who supposedly could surgically remove mother cells to cure obsessions. Okay. And then the story goes, he went searching for grandmother cells. The provocative implication, the real kicker, was that a relatively tiny number of neurons, maybe as few as 18,000, could form the basis of a conscious experience or a specific memory. Just 18,000 out of billions. Exactly. But for over 40 years, scientists mostly considered this idea, well, let's say in jest. It was a thought experiment, maybe even a bit of a joke sometimes. So what was the main argument against it? Why did it seem so, well, impractical? Or even absurd back then? Well, if you look at the broader scientific consensus, the dominant view was very different. It was what Nobel laureate Charles Sherrington famously called a million-fold democracy back in 1940. A million-fold democracy. I like that. It's a great phrase, isn't it? This perspective basically held that perception and memory weren't tied to single points or single cells. Instead, they emerged from the collective synchronized activity of millions, maybe even billions, of nerve cells. So a huge collaboration. A huge collaboration. In this distributed view, the firing of any single neuron was seen as pretty much meaningless on its own. True meaning, experience, it only arose from the complex interplay of large neural populations. So the thought of just one cell, or even a tiny group, being responsible for one specific concept, like your grandmother, it just felt incredibly inefficient, uneconomical, biologically speaking. And yet, something shifted. Dramatically, it sounds like, in the early 2000s. Something challenged that skepticism. Yes, that's where it gets particularly compelling. The challenge, of course, is always how you even begin to observe the activity of individual neurons inside a living human brain. Yeah, that sounds incredibly difficult. It is. It's only possible in very rare, specific circumstances. Our research and that of others, we've been able to make progress by working with epilepsy patients. How does that work? Well, as part of their clinical monitoring, sometimes they have electrodes implanted deep inside their skull. This is to pinpoint exactly where their seizures originate for potential treatment. Okay, for clinical reasons. Exactly. And during these monitoring periods, which can last several days, some patients very graciously volunteer for research studies. We owe them a tremendous debt. Absolutely. So, back in the 1990s, my colleague Itzhak Fried at UCLA, he pioneered a unique technique using these very fine, flexible electrodes. They allowed us to record individual neuron activity with really unprecedented resolution for the time. And working with Rodrigo Kian-Coroga and Christophe Koch, we then performed experiments. We showed these patients various images, celebrities, landmarks, animals, and recorded their brains' response at the single neuron level. And what was the big discovery? The one that changed things. So, in 2005, we published a finding that, yes, it really shook the field. We identified a specific neuron right there in the hippocampus, which we know is critical for memory. The memory center. That responded very strongly, very selectively to multiple different photographs of the actress Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer Aniston, specifically. Specifically. But crucially, it did not respond to dozens of other pictures we showed other celebrities, famous places, animals, you name it. That is specific. It was incredibly specific. And so, these cells quickly became known, colloquially anyway, as Jennifer Aniston cells. I can see why. That's a truly remarkable finding. But, going back to the grandmother cell idea. If that was flawed, how did these Jennifer Aniston cells fit in? Are they just the same thing? Ugh, that's a really crucial distinction to make. The extreme version, the parody almost, of the grandmother cell hypothesis, suggested this rigid one-to-one mapping. One neuron, one concept. Which sounds fragile. Extremely fragile. If that were literally true, think about it. The chances of us ever finding such a cell among billions would be minuscule. And more importantly, if that single neuron got damaged, the whole memory, the whole concept, would supposedly just vanish. Which doesn't seem right. No, it seems highly unlikely based on everything we know about brain resilience and damage. Our findings suggested something far more nuanced and actually more robust. Which is why we strongly prefer the term concept cells. Concept cells, concept cells. What makes these neurons so special and different from the old grandmother cell parody is their remarkable combination of selectivity and invariance. Selectivity and invariance. Can you break that down? Sure. Selectivity means they do fire very specifically, only to a small fraction of all the things we might show someone. So selective for Jennifer Aniston. But the invariance is the key. It means they respond to multiple varied representations of that particular person or place. That Jennifer Aniston neuron wasn't just firing to one photo. Ah, right. You said multiple photos. Multiple photos, yes. It fired if you showed a photo of her in a red dress, or maybe in profile, or even if her written name just appeared on the screen. Even the name. Even the written name, or if you simply spoke her name aloud. The neurons seem to be responding to the concept, the abstract idea of Jennifer Aniston. It strips away all the specific sensory details. So it's really about the underlying idea of Jennifer Aniston, not just a light hitting the retina in a certain pattern. Exactly. It's the abstract concept. And it gets even more interesting. If these cells do happen to fire to more than one concept, those concepts tend to be closely related, associatively linked. Like what? Well, for instance, that Jennifer Aniston neuron we found later testing showed it also responded, though perhaps less strongly, to Lisa Kudrow. Her co-star from Friends. Precisely. Similarly, we found another neuron that responded strongly to Luke Skywalker, and it also fired for Yoda. Okay, so related concepts. Related concepts. It indicates a slightly broader representation, but still highly selective overall. And this approach, where a relatively few neurons, maybe we're talking thousands, perhaps even less, are enough to represent a whole concept. That's called sparse coding. Sparse coding. Yes, and it's incredibly efficient. Think about it. The brain can effectively represent maybe around 10,000 different core concepts using just a tiny fraction of the billions of cells available, especially in areas like the medial temporal lobe. 10,000 concepts. That sounds like a lot, but maybe not compared to everything we know. It's enough for a powerful abstract representation of the key entities in our world. It's like having this highly optimized, incredibly fast index for your entire mental library. A fast index. I like that analogy. It helps clarify it. So considering the sparse coding, these concept cells, how does this all translate to how we actually form and retrieve our memories every day? Right, that's the critical question, isn't it? How does this apply practically? Our research is fundamentally tied to understanding how the brain takes in the outside world, interprets it, and then turns those perceptions into memories that last. Okay. You might think of the famous case of Patient HM. Right, I've read about him. He had surgery for epilepsy. Exactly. His hippocampus, a key structure deep in that medial temporal lobe area we mentioned, was surgically removed to treat severe epilepsy. Afterwards, he could still recognize things from his past, but he almost completely lost the ability to form new, long-lasting memories. He was stuck in time, essentially. In many ways, yes. And his case clearly showed that while the hippocampus isn't where perceptions happen, it's absolutely crucial for that transfer process, getting information from our short-term awareness into long-term storage. Gateway, sort of. A crucial gateway, yes. So, we propose that concept cells, located right there in these medial temporal lobe areas, are perfectly positioned to do this job. They translate what's in our immediate awareness into these long-term memories, which eventually get stored more broadly across the cerebral cortex. How do they do that? By being abstract. Exactly. They essentially grasp the gist of things, the core essence of situations, people, places, concepts that are relevant to us. They don't try to store
