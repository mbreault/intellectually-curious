## Transcript

Welcome to a deep dive on the 2023 Ashes series. The Ashes! You guys sent in a ton of articles about this epic rivalry. England versus Australia. And trust me, this series did not disappoint. Not at all. It had everything. Nail-biting finishes, controversy. All of the controversies. Yeah, they had everybody talking. Even people who don't watch cricket were talking about it. For sure. And then you've got the standout individual performances. Oh yeah, some amazing displays. Which we'll definitely get into a bit later. Yeah, looking forward to that. But before we really get into all of that. The nitty gritty. The nitty gritty, yeah. Let's set the stage a bit. All right. So the Ashes, it's more than just a series, right? Oh yeah, it's way more than that. I mean, it's steeped in history. Absolutely. Goes all the way back to 1882. That's right. That's when Australia beat England for the first time. On English soil. On English soil, yeah. And an English newspaper, they published this mock obituary. Yeah, it was lamenting the death of English cricket. They were pretty upset. Oh wow. They said that its ashes would be taken to Australia. Okay. So that's where the name comes from. Yeah, that's the origin story. But it's not like they're actually playing for... A pile of ashes. Like a pile of ashes, right? I mean, sort of? Yeah, kind of. I mean, the trophy is a tiny urn. A tiny urn. A tiny urn. Okay. And it's believed to actually contain the ashes of a burnt cricket bale. Wow, so they were kind of playing for ashes. Yeah, sort of. And every couple of years... Every couple of years. They battle it out. These two giants of cricket. Like brain rights. For bragging rights in the tiny urn. In that tiny urn. Yeah, so this year, Australia came in as the defending champions. Defending champs. Which, you know... Put extra pressure on England to win it back. Yeah, on their home turf, you know, they wanted to reclaim it. But they didn't just try to win. They came out with this new style. Aggressive. This aggressive style, which they called Baz Ball. Baz Ball, yeah. So Baz Ball... It really shook things up. Yeah, and it's named after England's coach. Brendan Baz McCullum. Brendan Baz McCullum. Yeah, and Baz Ball is all about attacking, taking risks, scoring fast. It's a really big change from the traditional approach to Test cricket. Oh yeah, it's like a complete 180. You know, usually it's like slow, kind of cautious. It's a calculated... Yeah, like a chess match. Yeah, but this was like... But this was like bam, bam, bam. Just a full-on attack. Yeah, so do you think it was a strategic masterstroke? Or just a reckless gamble? Oh, that's a great question. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting because on the surface, it looks chaotic. It does. But when you look closer, is there a method to the madness? Yeah, there's definitely a method. You know, Baz Ball is about shifting the pressure. Oh, I see. You know, forcing your opponent to make mistakes. Instead of being afraid to make a mistake yourself. Exactly, and it injected a whole new level of excitement into the game. So from the articles you've read, from what I've read, it seems like it definitely made for some thrilling matches. Oh, it did, yeah. So all five matches were pretty close. Yeah, they were all incredible close. I mean, four of them were decided by tiny margins. Just like down to the wire. Yeah, edge of your seat stuff. The first test at Edgbaston was a prime example. Yeah, great example. Australia won by just two wickets. Two wickets. And their last pair of batsmen had to score the final 54 runs. The pressure. Oh my goodness. I can't even imagine. I know, like the weight of history, the ashes are on the line. And every run must have felt like climbing a mountain. I know, just the tension on the field? Must have been unbelievable. I know, I wish I could have been there. Me too. But alongside all this excitement... There's also controversy. Oh yes, the controversy. There's plenty of that. Yeah, the second test at Lords. Lords? The infamous Bairstow incident. That's right. Seems like even people who don't follow cricket know about that one. Yeah, it was a global talking point. England batsman Johnny Bairstow ducked a ball, stepped out of his crease. Thought the play was over. Thought the play was over. Yeah, and then Alex Carey, the Aussie wicketkeeper... Seized the opportunity. Threw the ball at the stumps. And Bairstow was given out. Given out. So was it within the rules? Technically? Technically, yeah. Yeah, I mean, Carey's actions were completely legal. According to the rulebook? According to the rulebook, yeah. But a lot of people argue that it went against the spirit of the game. The spirit of the game, yeah. Cricket is known for its sportsmanship. Absolutely. You know, that unwritten code. That unwritten code, yeah. Where do you draw the line? Exactly. So it sparked this huge debate. Yeah, a global debate. About where the line is between playing by the rules... Yeah. And upholding the spirit of cricket. Right. So this incident really captured the complexity of this rivalry, didn't it? Yeah, it really did. Because it was more than just a game. Way more. It was about tradition. Yeah. Sportsmanship. The unwritten rules of the game. Yeah, all these extra layers. Those layers. That add to the competition. For sure. And it became a talking point that extended way beyond the cricket field. Far beyond. It was debated in pubs. In pubs, in parliament even. Really? In parliament? Oh yeah, front page news. Wow, so it really shows the cultural significance of the Ashes. You know how deep it's ingrained. In the national psyche. Yeah. Of both England and Australia. So amidst all the drama. And all the controversy. You also had some brilliant... Individual performances. Individual performances on both sides. Oh yeah, for sure. So each team had players who... You know, rose to the occasion. Rose to the occasion and etched their names in Ashes history. Into the history books. For Australia, Usman Khawaja. He was in top form. Exceptional form. Exceptional form. 496 runs. 496 runs, that's incredible. Yeah, I read about his incredible feat in the first test. Oh yeah, where he scored a century in each innings. In each innings. In each innings. That's something very few players have ever done. Right. He also became one of only 13 players to bat on all five days of a test match. Five days. Five days. Unbelievable. Yeah, it really speaks volumes about his... Mental toughness. Mental toughness, his ability to adapt to changing conditions. You gotta be so focused. So focused, I know. And Khawaja, his performance, it really anchored the Aussie batting lineup. It provided a solid foundation. Yeah, a foundation. It wasn't just about the runs he scored. It was about his presence at the crease. Yeah. Absorbing the pressure. That's it. Setting the tone for his teammates. Yeah, he was a leader. Yeah, and then for England, you've got Zach Crawley. Oh, Zach Crawley. Yeah. He had a breakout series. He did. Finished with 480 runs. 480 runs. Including that sensational 189 in the fourth test. Oh, that was an incredible knock. It was like he announced himself on the world stage. Yeah, he arrived. He really embodied that fearless spirit of Baz Ball. Yeah, he was fearless. With every single shot. Every shot. His innings were a perfect example. A textbook example. Of how England's aggressive approach could change the momentum of a match. It really rattled the Aussies. They weren't used to it. No, they weren't used to it at all. And then there's Stuart Broad. A true legend. Veteran bowler achieved a massive milestone. A massive milestone. 600th test wicket. 600 test wickets, wow. He's only the fifth bowler in history to reach that. But that's insane. Incredible landmark. It's incredible. And to top it off. To top it all off. He announced his retirement from cricket. Right after the fifth test. Right after the fifth test. What a way to go out. Ending on a high. On such a high. Talk about going out with a bang. A legend. I know. So speaking of veterans. Yeah. England's bowling lineup in the fourth test. Yeah. Was the oldest they'd fielded in almost a century. Almost a century. It's fascinating to see players like Anderson and Broad. Yeah. Who've been at the top of their game for so long. For so long. Still performing at such a high level. But it does make you wonder what's next for English cricket. What's next, yeah. When these guys are gone. Who's going to fill those shoes? Who's going to step up? Big question marks. So we've got Baz Ball. This exciting new style. A potential changing of the guard. In the bowling attack. And this rivalry. That just keeps on giving. That keeps on giving. The Ashes never disappoints. And remember, all of this was before the fourth test. Where Australia retained the Ashes. Yeah. The series was already decided. But there was still plenty to play for. Oh
