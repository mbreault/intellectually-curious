## Description

A deep dive into Fantasy Pointsâ€™ June 23 piece on age curves. We break down RB and WR peak windows, translate trends into smarter drafts, and spotlight power-law outliers. From year-two RB targets (e.g., Breece Hall, James Cook) to year-two/three WR breakouts (Waddell, St. Brown, Moore) and the year-eight cliff, plus red flags and practical tipsâ€”remember, these are trends, not guarantees.

## Transcript

Right, so fantasy football fans, we all want to crush our drafts, right? Oh, yeah. So today we're going to go on a deep dive into this really cool Fantasy Points article from back in June, June 23rd, called Age Curves, When NFL Players Break Out and Fall Off. Catch it, title. Yeah, you know, we always want to know, like, when to draft those rising stars. Yeah, when to avoid them. When to avoid those older players. Right. And this is really going to give us some great insights. Yeah, for sure. Get ready for some surprising stuff. I'm ready. Like, you might think twice about taking that old running back. Yeah. Like that sophomore tight end might actually be like a secret weapon. Yeah. So. It's fascinating stuff, but, you know, we always got to remember, we're looking at trends here, right? Right. Not guarantees. Right. You know? It's not a crystal ball. Exactly. This is just another tool for your fantasy arsenal. Right. Not the be all, end all. Individual players and talent and situation always matters. For sure. But these age curves. Yeah. Can give us a framework to make those smarter decisions. Yeah, definitely. Let's help us make some better bets. Make better bets. That's a good way to put it, and trust me. Okay. We're about to uncover some serious draft day gold. Okay. All right. I'm excited. Let's start with the heart and soul of any fantasy team. All right. Running backs. Okay, let's do it. This article throws out this wild stat. Running backs see a 42% jump in production from their rookie year to their second year. That's huge. On average. Yeah, that's a big jump. That's huge. But let's think about why, though. Okay. You know, it's not just about age, right? Year two is when a lot of factors can start clicking into place. Yeah. You know, they're more comfortable with the playbook they've got. Right, they've had a year in the NFL. Exactly. A year of NFL coaching under their belts. Yeah. And sometimes opportunities open up. Right. When those veterans move on. Like, yeah, they get more carries. Exactly. More touches. I'm thinking of guys like Joe Mixon, LaShawn McCoy. Nick Chubb. All those guys made that leap. Yeah. You know? Big time. Big time. And that's why targeting those second year running backs. Yeah. Can be such a smart move in your drafts. You're getting them before their price tag catches up to their potential. Yes, you're getting them on the cheap. Yeah. But you know what? What about? The flip side is also important. Yeah. If a running back hasn't shown much by year two, that might be a red flag. Yeah. Especially in dynasty leagues. Especially dynasty. They're looking long term. You've got to think about that. Yeah. Speaking of red flags. Okay. How about this? The article says that those rookie running backs who absolutely dominate. Yeah. Guys like Najee Harris. Yeah. They actually tend to regress a little in year two. Interesting. So, like, temper those expectations. Those shiny new toys. Yeah. Sometimes it's a little bit of a sophomore slump. Sophomore slumps, yeah. Happens. No. Here's where things get a little grim. Okay. Year seven is when that dreaded decline starts to set in for running backs. Right. Year seven out. And by year eight? Oh, by year eight. Forget about it. Forget about it. Things get real ugly. We're talking about guys from that legendary 2017 class. Yeah. Yeah. McCaffrey, Eckler. Cook. Yeah. They're all facing that cliff. Yeah, that's right. They might still have some good seasons left in them. Yeah. But that risk is there. Risk is there. For sure. But you know what? What's that? There's this concept called power law players. Oh, yeah. Okay, hold up. Yeah. Power law players. Power law player. Break that down for me. Okay, so basically it's this idea that a small percentage of players. Yeah. Account for a disproportionate amount of production. Okay. Like think McCaffrey and Eckler. Right. They're prime examples. Right. Their talent, their receiving ability, and their situations have allowed them to stay elite longer than most running backs. So they're like the exceptions to the rule. Exactly. They're the exceptions, not the rule. Okay. And that's where your fantasy football savvy comes in. Okay. Can you identify those outliers? Right. Because those are the players that can win you championships. That's the key right there. That's it. Finding those outliers. That's the key. Speaking of outliers. Right. Let's talk about Derrick Henry. Okay, the key. Year eight, right in that danger zone. Right in the thick of it. What's the verdict? Well, the article actually uses comparable players to analyze his situation. And it's pretty fascinating. He's either going to have another monster year or he's going to fall off a cliff. Oh, wow. There's not much in between. So it's high risk, high reward. Exactly. High risk, high reward situation with Henry. You got to love that. You got to love it. All right, so let's wrap up this running back discussion with some actionable advice. All right, hit me. Target those year two guys. Yes. We're talking about guys like Brees Hall and James Cook. Oh, they're going to be great. They're primed for big seasons. They are. And don't forget about those deeper sleepers. Okay. Guys like Rashad White, Brian Robinson. Okay, yeah. They might have had rough rookie years, but their situations have improved and their ADP makes them worth a late round gamble. For sure. All right, so we got our running backs locked in. Okay. Now let's shift gears and talk about those electric playmakers. All right. The wide receivers. Let's talk about it. What do the age curves tell us about drafting them? So unlike running backs, wide receivers are known for being late bloomers. Okay. They tend to peak a bit later, around year five. Interesting. Yeah. So we're not necessarily looking for those sophomore breakouts. Right. Like we were with running backs. Not always. Okay. But here's the catch. All right. While their peak comes later, their decline also starts sooner than you might think. There's a significant chance of retirement. Wow. After year eight. So a shorter window than I would have thought. It is a shorter window, yeah. Man, it makes you appreciate those guys who can stay productive for a long time. It really does, yeah. It really does. It highlights the importance of understanding these age curves. It does because, you know, a receiver who looks like a safe bet based purely on talent might actually be a ticking time bomb. Right. In terms of fantasy value. That's a good way to put it. Yeah. Okay, so year eight is the danger zone for wide receivers. Yeah. Anyone in particular come to mind? Well, I mean, think about Allen Robinson. Oh, yeah. He was a fantasy stud just a few years ago. He was. But he's seen his career fade pretty quickly. Yeah. You know, and that's the reality for a lot of wide receivers. Wow. Yeah. All right, so if year eight is the danger zone. Yeah. When should we be targeting wide receivers in our drafts? Well, the article points to years two and three as prime breakout territory for wide receivers. Okay, so this is where we can find value. Yeah, this is where you can find some serious value, especially in redraft leagues. Yeah, it makes sense. Yeah. They've had some time to develop. They're starting to hit their stride. Right. And their ADP might not reflect their full potential yet. Exactly. And, you know, we've seen some high-profile rookie wide receiver breakouts in recent years. We have. But that could be small sample size bias, right? It could be. We need more data. Yeah. To know for sure if that's a trend or an anomaly. Yeah, we need more data points to really draw those conclusions. So let's talk about some names. Okay. Who are those year two and three guys who fit that breakout mold? Well, you got guys like Jalen Waddell, Amon Ross St. Brown, Devonta Smith. Yeah. All of whom had impressive year two breakouts. Yeah. And then you have the year three guys like Debo Samuel, Dante Johnson, CeeDee Lamb. Yeah, those are some big names. Yeah. And they're all probably going pretty high in drafts. Yeah, probably. Are there any under-the-radar guys? Oh, yeah, of course. Who could fit that breakout profile? Of course. So a guy like Elijah Moore is an interesting case. He hasn't quite linked up to the hype yet. Right. But based on this age curve, he still has a chance to break out. Okay. Yeah. Interesting. So we've got our early breakouts and our late career fades. Yeah. Now let's dive into that wide receiver danger zone. Okay. Year 10 and beyond. That's scary stuff. This is where things get tricky. Okay. We're talking about some of the biggest names in the game. Okay. Devante Adams, DeAndre Hopkins, Keenan Allen, Mike Evans, Brandon Cooks. Wow. Okay. They're all walking a tightrope. And it's not just about age, right? No, it's not just about age. There are other factors that increase the risk for these guys. Absolutely. They're more susceptible to things like QB changes, new offenses, and even the perception of age-related decline can impact their targets and opportunities. Yeah, a
