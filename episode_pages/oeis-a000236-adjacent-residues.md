Learn about OEIS A000236 Adjacent Residues

## Transcript

Welcome to this deep dive. Today we're jumping into modular arithmetic, which is this really elegant system where numbers sort of wrap around like the hours on a clock, right? Exactly like a clock. It's a concept Gauss really laid out formally way back in 1801 in Disquisitio Arithmeticae. Hugely influential work. Absolutely. And we're going to focus on something specific within that today, something called adjacent residues. That's right. And this connects, interestingly enough, to the online encyclopedia of integer sequences, the OEIS. Specifically, sequence A000236. For number theory students tuning in, the OEIS is just an indispensable tool. Oh, definitely. Okay, so before we get lost in sequences, maybe we should pin down the basics, like congruence modulo M. Good idea. So A is congruent to B modulo M. Well, it just means A and B have the same remainder when you divide them by M, or you could say M divides their difference, M minus B. Okay, like 38 and 14 modulo 12. They both leave a remainder of 2. Exactly. So 38 is congruent to 14 mod 12. Perfect. Got it. And building on that, quadratic residues. Yes. So for a given modulus, let's say N, an integer Q is a quadratic residue if, well, if it's like a square in that system. It's a square. Meaning there's some integer X where X squared is congruent to Q modulo N. Oh, okay. And if you can't find such an X, then Q is a quadratic non-residue. Simple as that, really. Some numbers act like squares, others don't. Right. Okay, so adjacent residues, this is where we look at numbers next to each other. Precisely. We take a prime number, P, and look at the integers, say from 1 up to P minus 1, and we ask if we pick a number K, is it a quadratic residue or non-residue? And what about the next number, K plus 1? So like if K is a square mod P, is K plus 1 also a square? Or maybe it's not. That's the question. And we use the Legendre symbol to classify these. It's just notation, KP, which is 1 if K is a residue and any other way if it's a non-residue. It helps keep track. Okay, and we're looking at K from 1 up to P minus 2, right? Because we need K plus 1 to still be less than P. Exactly. We define four sets based on these pairs, K plus 1. What are these sets? Lay them out for us. Okay, so first, A arrow. This is a set of all K where both K and K plus 1 are quadratic residues. So KP equals 1 and K plus 1P equals 1. Residue followed by residue, got it. Then A arrow, that's where K is a residue, but K plus 1 is a non-residue. So KP 1, K plus 1P equals 1. Residue, non-residue, okay. Next, A arrow, the other way around, K is a non-residue, K plus 1 is a residue, KP minus 1, K plus 1P equals 1. Non-residue, residue, makes sense. And finally, Error. That's when both K and K plus 1 are non-residues, KP minus 1, K plus 1P equals 1. Non-residue, non-residue. So these four sets cover all the possibilities for consecutive pairs. They do, and the fascinating part is counting how many elements fall into each set. We call these counts alpha ij, so A arrow, I arrow, arrow. And is there a pattern to these counts, or is it just random depending on the prime P? Oh, there's definitely a pattern, a really quite beautiful one. It depends crucially on whether the prime P is congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4. Ah, okay, that distinction comes up a lot in number theory. It really does. So we actually have formulas for these counts, the I have all values. Formulas, let's hear them. This is where it gets interesting. Okay, if your prime P is congruent to 1 modulo 4, so it's like 5, 13, 17, etc. Right, form 4n plus 1. Then the number of residue pairs is P5 4. Okay. And the other three counts, residue-non-residue, non-residue-residue, and non-residue-non-residue, they're all? All equal. To what? They're all P1 4. Huh. So one is different, the other three are the same when P is 1 mod 4. Precisely. But now, if P is congruent to 3 modulo 4, so primes like 3, 7, 11, 19. Form 4n plus 3. Yes. The formulas shift a bit. Now, it's the residue-non-residue count, IS, that's different. It becomes P plus 1 4. P plus 1 4 this time, okay. The other three, IA, AIR, and IS, they're the ones that are equal now. And they are equal too. They become P3 4. Wow, okay, that's remarkably specific. The counts depend entirely on P mod 4. It is quite striking. It shows there's this underlying structure governing the distribution. It's not just haphazard. Can we make this more concrete? Maybe walk through an example. Absolutely. Let's take P equals 17. Now, 17 is 1 mod 4, right? 4 times 4 plus 1. Right, so we use the first set of formulas. Expect 17 to 5 4 4 equals 3, and the others to be 17 to 1 4 equals 4. Exactly. So first, you list the quadratic residues mod 17. They are 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16. Okay. Now we look for adjacent pairs. Residue, residue, A, 0, 1, 2 is R, R, 8, 9 is R, R, 15, 16 is R, R. That's three pairs, 1, 8, 15. So A, 0, 3 matches. Perfect. Residue, non-residue, A, 2, 3 is R, N, 4, 5 is R, N, 9, 10 is R, N, 13, 14 is R, N. Four pairs, 2, 4, 9, 13. Also matches. Yep. Non-residue, residue, 3, 4 is N, R, 7, 8 is N, R, 12, 13 is N, R, 14, 15 is N, R. Four again, 3, 7, 12, 14. Also. Check. And finally, non-residue, non-residues, A, 0, 5, 6 is N, N, 6, 7 is N, N, 10, 11 is N, N, 11, 12 is N, N. Also four, 5, 6, 10, 11. It works out exactly as the formulas predicted. It does. It's quite satisfying to see it. Okay, what about a prime that's 3 mod 4, like 19? Good choice. 19 is 3 mod 4, so we expect 19 plus 1, 4, 4, 5, and the others to be 19 to 3, 4, which was 4. Right. Residues mod 19 are 1, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9, 11, 16, 17. Okay. Residue A, 0, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 16, 17. That's four pairs. 4, 5, 6, 16. So matches the formula, 19 to 3, 4. Residue, non-residue, A, 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18. That's five pairs. 1, 7, 9, 11, 17. Matches 19 plus 1, 4. Excellent. Non-residue, residue, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16. Four pairs. 3, 8, 10, 15. Matches 19 to 3, 4. And non-residue, A, 12, 13, 13, 14, 15. Also four pairs. 12, 13, 14. Matches 19 to 3, 4. Amazing it holds up perfectly again. It does. It's a well-established result, but it's still quite elegant to see the calculation work. It really demonstrates this hidden regularity. You wouldn't necessarily guess it just looking at the list of residues. Not at all. And you know, Gauss himself was looking into this sort of counting back in 1828. Oh, really? In what context? It was related to determining when the congruence X to the power of 4 is congruent to 2 modulo P has solutions by quadratic residues. Ah, so understanding these adjacent quadratic residue
