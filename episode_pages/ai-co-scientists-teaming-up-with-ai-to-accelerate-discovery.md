## Transcript

You know, we hear all this talk about AI changing the world, right? Yeah, definitely a lot of hype out there. But what if AI could, like, team up with scientists? Oh, wow. To make, like, huge discoveries. Yeah. That's what we're diving into today. That's awesome. We're talking about a system that acts like a superpowered research assistant. Okay. So it helps scientists come up with and test out their hypotheses. But it's not about replacing scientists. Right. It's about giving them a boost. Like a tool, almost. Exactly. Yeah. It's a tool. That's fascinating, the idea of an AI co-scientist. It's not about replacing us. It's about making us better. This system can go through tons of data, come up with ideas, and even suggest experiments all way faster than a person could. That's incredible. So you've probably wondered, how could an AI actually help with scientific discovery? Right. This research paper we're looking at breaks down a system that does just that. And it's already doing some pretty amazing things. Wow. Like, think potential new treatments for leukemia and liver fibrosis. That's huge. Yeah, and that's really just the beginning. This isn't just like a fancy search engine that summarizes research. This AI is like a scientist itself. Oh, wow. It's got this multi-agent architecture, which means different parts of the system have specific jobs. Some parts come up with ideas. Others are like the critics, and then others rank them based on how good they could be. So it's like a whole team of little AI scientists, each with their own specialty working together. That's amazing. So how do they come up with these hypotheses in the first place? How's it even possible? It's pretty cool. It uses a combination of, like, searching the web and using tools like AlphaFold to make sure its suggestions make sense based on what we already know about science. Like, it can use predictions from AlphaFold, which is a tool that predicts protein structures to see if a drug is likely to interact with the target protein. This is huge because it helps to throw out the bad ideas really early on. That's so smart. It's like giving the AI a crash course in all the relevant science before letting it go wild. Exactly. And to make sure only the best ideas make it, they use this tournament system. Each agent proposes an idea, then they critique each other. The best ones get improved and move on to the next round. It's kind of like a science debate, but turned into an algorithm. I love that. So let's get into the specifics. One area where this AI co-scientist is already showing a lot of potential is in drug repurposing. Right. So basically finding new uses for drugs that are already approved for other things. This is way faster and cheaper than creating new drugs from scratch. Yeah, definitely. A really interesting example of this is with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. It's a very serious blood cancer, and there aren't a lot of good treatments. The researchers wanted to see if the AI could find existing drugs that could be used to treat AML, and they focused on a specific cell line called MoM13. So did anything surprising happen when they tested the AI with AML? Absolutely. The AI not only found drugs that we already had some evidence might work for AML, but it also suggested some totally new candidates. Oh, wow. Like KIRA6 and Leflunomide. And get this. They actually tested these suggestions in the lab, and they showed real potential in stopping the growth of AML cells. That's incredible. So it sounds like this could really speed up how we develop new drugs. What does that mean for the future of medicine? Well, for one, it could mean getting new treatments to people faster. It could also mean that developing new drugs becomes a lot cheaper, which is a huge problem right now. So we've seen how the AI can find new uses for existing drugs. But what about finding entirely new targets for treatments? Right. That's where things get even more interesting. The researchers also used the AI to look at liver fibrosis. Okay. It's a serious condition that can lead to liver failure. Right. Finding new treatments for liver fibrosis is super tough, but this is where the AI co-scientist really stands out. Okay. It was able to go through tons of data and find three promising epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis. Interesting. Okay, hold on. Before we go any further, could you explain what you mean by epigenetic targets? Sure. I think our listeners might need a bit more background on that. Yeah, you're right. So epigenetics is basically the study of how genes are turned on or off without changing the actual DNA sequence. It's like a set of switches that control how our genes work. And these epigenetic targets are specific molecules that are part of this process. So if you can target these molecules, you can potentially change how genes are expressed and treat the disease. Exactly. And the really exciting part is that drugs targeting two of the AI-suggested targets actually worked pretty well in lab tests. They showed significant antifibrotic activity. So not only did the AI identify these potential targets, but the suggestions were validated in experiments. That's incredible. It is. It really shows how powerful this technology can be for speeding up scientific discoveries. This is all so amazing, but there's even more to this story. We'll be right back to dig deeper into what this AI co-scientist can do. And it's not just about, you know, finding new drugs or treatments. One of the really cool things about this research is that the AI was able to actually recreate a past scientific breakthrough. Wow, really? It could do that? Like, what kind of breakthrough are we talking about? So scientists, you know, spent years trying to figure out how antibiotic resistance works in bacteria, specifically these things called capsid-forming phage-inducible chromosomal islands, or C-F-P-I-C-I-S. Okay, C-F-P-I-C-I-S, got it. What do those have to do with antibiotic resistance? Well, these C-F-P-I-C-I-S, they're kind of like little packages of genes that bacteria can share with each other, and sometimes these packages have genes that make the bacteria resistant to antibiotics. So it's like trading cards, but for antibiotic resistance genes. That's kind of scary. It is, and understanding how these C-F-P-I-C-I-S work is super important if we want to find new ways to fight antibiotic resistance. So how did the AI help with this? The researchers gave the AI the same goal to figure out how these C-F-P-I-C-I-S work, but here's the thing. They didn't tell the AI anything about the breakthrough that scientists had already made. It was like a blind test. Oh, wow, and what happened? It's amazing the AI was able to come up with the same answer that took scientists years to figure out, and it did it in just two days. Two days versus years, that's unbelievable. It makes you wonder what other breakthroughs we're missing out on just because, you know, our human brains can only handle so much. It really does make you think, and it shows how much potential AI has to speed up scientific discoveries. Absolutely, but I think it's important to remember that this AI isn't meant to replace scientists, right? No, not at all. It's all about working together. Scientists are still the ones setting the goals, giving feedback on the AI's suggestions, and deciding what to do next. It's a partnership where both sides bring something unique to the table. That makes sense. It's like having a brainstorming partner that can think super fast and come up with ideas that we might miss. Yeah, exactly. But we also have to remember that no system is perfect. This AI co-scientist is still being developed, and there are things that need to be improved. So what are some of the areas where they're working on making it better? Well, one thing is they're trying to come up with better ways to evaluate the AI's work. Right now it mostly relies on auto ratings, which means the AI is basically grading itself. That's helpful, but it's also important to get feedback from human experts to make sure it's on the right track. So it needs a little human guidance to keep it in check. Makes sense. We've been talking a lot about how this AI can be used in biomedicine, but are there other areas where it could be helpful? Oh, absolutely. This technology could be used in any field where there's scientific research. Imagine using this AI to go through climate models, pick out the best ones, and use them to predict how climate change will affect specific neighborhoods. That's the kind of detail we need to be able to adapt. That would be amazing, to be able to predict how climate change will impact different communities would be so valuable for planning and prevention. Exactly. Or think about materials science. The AI could help design new materials with special properties, which could lead to breakthroughs in everything from renewable energy to space travel. Wow. The possibilities seem endless. It's like having a scientific collaborator that can help us push the boundaries of knowledge in so many ways. And what's really incredible is how fast this AI can work. Remember the CFPR example? Years of human research done in just two days. It's mind-blowing. We could be entering a new era of scientific exploration where human ingenuity is amplified by the power of AI. It's definitely an exciting time to be involved in science. But with all this potential comes responsibility. We need to make sure we're using this technology wisely and ethically. That's a great point. It's not just about the discoveries themselves, but about the choices we make about how we use them. Yeah, it's like we're not just creating new tools for science. We're changing how we think about science altogether. Yeah, for sure. That's pretty amazing. So we've talked about how this AI can speed up research, but
