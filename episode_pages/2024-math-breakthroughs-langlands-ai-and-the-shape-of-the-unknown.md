## Transcript

Welcome back everybody to another deep dive and today we're going to be tackling some of the biggest mathematical breakthroughs of 2024. We're pulling most of our information from a recent article by Quantum Magazine. Always a great publication and a big shout out to the Simons Foundation for their support of Quantum Magnet. It's a really fascinating time to be following mathematics right now. Especially this year we're seeing this collision of pure mathematics and the growing influence of AI. Yeah for sure and I think that's no more clear than in the proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture. This like massive undertaking 800 pages, like three decades in the making to finally prove this thing. Can you maybe give us just like a quick rundown of why this is such a big deal and like where it fits into mathematics as a whole? So the Langlands program is kind of like a holy grail of mathematics. It's like this search for a unified theory of math. So trying to connect all these different fields, algebra, geometry, number theory into like one overarching framework. And you can kind of think of it as like a Rosetta Stone that lets you translate between different mathematical languages. Okay so where does this like conjecture fit into that? Well the geometric Langlands conjecture, it was like this missing piece of the puzzle. And its proof, it actually reveals all these deep connections between areas of math that like really seemed completely unrelated before. Like it links geometric objects called sheaves. I'm not familiar with those. So sheaves are like, it's a way to organize information over a geometric space. So you can think of them as like blueprints for building mathematical structures. Okay. And it links those to the representation theory of groups which studies symmetries. So like how symmetrical something is. Yeah basically. And it's amazing because it shows how these seemingly different concepts are like two sides of the same coin. I see so like this is more than just like proving one thing. It's like creating this whole bridge between these different areas of math. Yeah exactly. It's like opening these whole new avenues for research. And it suggests there's this like a deeper, more fundamental structure to math than we thought. That's insane and it makes me think about another big theme of this year, artificial intelligence. We saw AI actually competing in the International Mathematical Olympiad. DeepMind's alpha geometry and then later alpha proof. Did anyone see AI meddling at this level coming in? I think it definitely caught a lot of people off guard. So alpha geometry was using this geometric reasoning to compete and it did incredibly well. Then alpha proof, it actually integrated with Google's language model Gemini and that pushed it even further to win a silver medal. Wow so how does like an AI actually prove a theorem? That's what's so interesting. It uses this combination of like symbolic reasoning. Like you know how humans manipulate equations. But it combines that with pattern recognition on a huge scale. So it can sift through tons of data, identify potential patterns, and then use those to construct logical arguments. So it's almost like AI is developing its own form of mathematical intuition. But is it really like understanding these concepts or is it just like super advanced pattern matching? That's a really great question and it's something that people are still debating. But it's clear that AI is becoming this incredibly powerful tool for math research. You know it can explore these vast landscapes of possibilities, help identify new avenues of research, even help with constructing parts of proofs. This is more like a collaborator than a replacement. Exactly. AI as a co-pilot for mathematicians. Which I think makes me think about this discovery of mathematical murmuration. The idea that equations can behave like flocks of birds. It's like poetry almost. It really is a fascinating discovery. It shows how interconnected nature and mathematics can be. So researchers found that elliptic curves, these equations that are very important in number theory and cryptography, they exhibit these patterns that when you visualize them they look incredibly similar to the movements of bird flocks. That's so wild. Yeah. But beyond just the visual beauty, what's the like mathematical significance of this? It's already led to new insights in the development of these new functions. Just by studying these patterns, researchers are gaining this deeper understanding of the structure of elliptic curves. So the equations are almost like whispering secrets about the nature of numbers and we're starting to understand them. Yeah, it's a really cool way to think about it. And it's like a testament to the power of observation and how beauty and elegance can guide us to deeper mathematical truths. Absolutely. All right, let's move on to something that maybe seems a little more down to earth but gets very complex very quickly. Sphere packing. You know, everyone's tried to fit as many oranges as possible into a box. But this problem becomes something else entirely when you go beyond three dimensions. Yeah, it's a problem that's fascinated mathematicians for centuries. Maria Vierzowska had that huge breakthrough in 2016 where she proved the optimal packing for 8 and 24 dimensions. But finding a general solution for any number of dimensions is still this like elusive goal. And that's where this breakthrough from this year comes in, right? The use of disorder in sphere packing. Exactly. Researchers kind of threw out the rule book and instead of looking for these highly ordered arrangements, they started exploring these disorderly packing arrangements. That's so counterintuitive. I know, right? So they used graph theory to analyze the relationship between the spheres. And what they found is they could actually achieve greater density in higher dimensions using this less structured approach. So like a little bit of chaos actually leads to better results. Yeah, sometimes that's the case. That's amazing. What makes this graph theory approach so effective? So with graph theory, you can represent each sphere as a node in a network and the connections between them as edges. So by analyzing this network, they were able to find all these configurations where the spheres could be packed more tightly. Even though the arrangement looked less structured at first glance. I see. So it's like finding these hidden pockets of space by letting go of this need for perfect order. Yeah, kind of like that. Wow. And what kind of implications does this have beyond just like the realm of abstract math? Well, it actually has a lot of potential applications. In coding theory, for example, sphere packing is used to design these error correcting codes, you know, to transmit information reliably over noisy channels. And in material science, it can help design new materials with like very specific properties. So something as simple as like stacking oranges can have these huge implications. Exactly. And speaking of challenging assumptions, let's talk about the Milnor conjecture. This thing was considered a cornerstone of topology for 50 years until it was recently disproven. This is a great example of how even these long held beliefs in math can be overturned. Can you give us like a quick explanation of what the Milnor conjecture was about? Yeah, so it dealt with this relationship between an object's overall shape and how it looks when you zoom in really close. So it said that you could understand the global structure of something by looking at its behavior at these really small scales. And for 50 years, it seemed to hold up. It was this fundamental principle in topology. So it's like saying if you zoom in on a smooth curve, it'll always look like a straight line at a small enough scale. Exactly. But then this team of mathematicians, they discovered these counterexamples. They actually created these really intricate mathematical objects that seemed smooth from afar. But when you zoomed in close enough, they had this really bizarre and unexpected behavior. So they found these shapes that kind of break our intuition about how things should work. Yeah, exactly. And to do it, they had to develop all these new mathematical structures and techniques. It showed us that the universe of possible shapes is way stranger than we thought. That's incredible. All right, so let's shift gears now and talk about number theory. 2024 saw some big steps towards solving some really major problems. You mentioned the Riemann hypothesis, which is kind of like the holy grail of math. What progress was made there? So the Riemann hypothesis, it basically composes this deep connection between the distribution of prime numbers and this complex mathematical function called the Riemann zeta function. Now, a full proof of that is still out there, but two mathematicians this year, they developed a new estimate for the number of potential exceptions to the hypothesis. So even if we haven't proven the rule, we're getting a better idea of how often it might be broken. Yeah, that's a good way to put it. And the old record for this stood for like 80 years. So this is a big advancement. It narrows down the search for counterexamples, and it also gives us valuable insights into the behavior of prime numbers. That's pretty cool. And what about Semeredi's problem? This one sounds a little more abstract. Can you break it down for us? Sure. So Semeredi's problem, it explores how order emerges from these seemingly random collections of numbers. Like imagine you have this big set of numbers just scattered randomly. The problem asks, how large does this set have to be before it's guaranteed to contain certain patterns, like arithmetic progressions? Okay, so like a sequence where each number is obtained by adding a constant value to the one before it. Right, and what's fascinating is that no matter how random you try to make this set of numbers, if it gets big enough, it's bound to have these ordered patterns in it. So there's like a hidden order within the chaos. Yeah. Yeah, that's a great way to think about it. And this year, three graduate students, they made a huge breakthrough. They developed these new techniques that let them improve the estimate for the largest size a set can be before these arithmetic progressions have to show up. Wow, and this is the first progress on this problem in decades. Yeah, it's a really significant achievement. That's awesome. Before we wrap
