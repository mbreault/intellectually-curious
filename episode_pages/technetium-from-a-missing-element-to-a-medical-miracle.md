## Description

A deep dive into technetium, the first artificially created element. From Mendeleevâ€™s eka-manganese and the hunt for a missing piece to Perrier and Segreâ€™s cyclotron breakthrough, and the modern use of technetium-99m in millions of medical scans each year via Mo-99 generatorsâ€”how a nuclear byproduct became a life-saving tool.

## Transcript

Welcome to the deep dive. We go deep, deep, deep into all sorts of things you might think you know. Like what? Well, today's a good example. We're talking about technetium. Technetium? Uh-huh. It doesn't exist naturally on Earth. At least not in any kind of quantity you could actually use. Right. We actually created it ourselves as a byproduct of nuclear reactors. Which is pretty wild. It is wild. But here's the twist. It's also used in millions of medical scans every year. Yeah, that's the crazy part. I mean, it really is a fascinating element. I mean, the fact that it was the very first element to be artificially created. Oh, yeah, that's right. It doesn't just exist in nuclear waste. We literally make it on purpose for medical imaging. So in this deep dive, are we going to learn how an element went from being completely missing on Earth to being something we're both making by accident and making on purpose? That's exactly what we're going to do. That's wild. I love it. That's a great story. Where do we even begin with something like that? Well, I think the best place to start is back in the 1870s. Okay. With Dmitry Mendeleev. Oh, yeah, the periodic table guy. Exactly. He's working on his periodic table, and he realizes there's this gap right below manganese. And he thinks, based on the patterns he's seeing, there should be an element there. He even predicts what its properties should be. Oh, wow. And he calls this mystery element eka-manganese. Wow. So he just knew it had to be there. Yeah. Just based on how everything else lined up. Pretty much, yeah. And, you know, it was a revolutionary idea at the time, and it actually spurred this huge scientific treasure hunt. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Everybody wanted to be the one to find this missing element. That makes sense. Did anybody get close? Oh, there were some false starts. Like, in the 1920s, there was this team of German scientists. Okay. And they thought they'd found it. They called it mesurium. Oh, mesurium. Yeah. I think I've heard of that. Didn't it turn out to be, like, the wrong thing? It did. Later analysis showed that the methods they were using actually weren't sensitive enough to detect the tiny amounts of technetium that were probably in their samples. Oh, so close. So close. So how did we go from this theoretical element on the periodic table to actually knowing it was real? Someone must have actually found it. They did. In 1937, two Italian scientists, Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre, they're working at the University of Palermo. Okay. And they were doing some experiments with a cyclotron. The cyclotron. Oh, man, physics class is coming back to me now. That's like a particle accelerator, right? Yep. It accelerates charged particles to extremely high speeds and then smashes them into a target. Got it. In this case, the target was molybdenum. Molybdenum, uh-huh. And they bombarded it with these particles called deuterons, which are basically heavy hydrogen nuclei. Okay, so they were basically trying to, like, smash atoms together and see what happens. Well, they were trying to transform molybdenum into something else, and it worked. They made technetium. They did. They were the first ones to ever create technetium in a lab. It was a huge moment. That must have been amazing for them. I'm sure it was. So they get to name it, right? Oh, yeah, they got naming rights. And they went with technetium. Technetium. From the Greek word technetos, which means artificial. Which makes sense, given the whole making it in a lab thing. Right. Perfect name for the first ever artificially created element. So we've got this lab-created element, but what is it actually like? You know, what's it look like? What's it do? It's a silvery-gray metal. Okay. It usually comes in powder form. But there's a catch. It's radioactive. Right. Always important to remember that part. Yeah, you don't want to be handling this stuff without taking precautions. Definitely not. So I'm guessing we won't be seeing any technetium necklaces or anything like that anytime soon. Probably not. But chemically speaking, it's really interesting. Oh. Oh, yeah. So on the periodic table, it sits right between manganese and rhenium. And in terms of its behavior, it actually resembles rhenium more closely. So it's kind of like a rebel in the family. You could say that. It likes to do its own thing, especially when it comes to forming bonds. It really prefers to make covalent bonds, just like rhenium does. Fascinating. You know, I'm already getting the sense that this technetium is full of surprises. You have no idea. Just wait till we get to the part where this radioactive metal starts saving lives. Wait, wait, we're going from particle accelerators to medicine. Okay, I am definitely going to need to hear more about this. Buckle up. It's going to be a wild ride. Oh, I love it. All right, so radioactive metal saving lives. I got to know how that happens. Well, it all starts with how technetium is made. Okay. Remember we were talking about nuclear reactors? So when uranium or plutonium atoms split in a reactor, it's called nuclear fission, they form smaller atoms. And one of those byproducts is technetium-99. Technetium-99, okay. And that's the most common type of technetium. Exactly. It's the most common isotope. Isotope, okay. But there's a problem. What's that? Technetium-99, it has a really long half-life. Oh, no. Over 200,000 years. 200,000 years. That means it stays radioactive for a very, very long time. So it's basically nuclear waste. Essentially, yes. And it's a big challenge because we have to figure out how to store it safely for, well, basically forever. Yeah, that sounds tricky. So how do we go from this radioactive waste product to something that's actually helpful in medicine? Well, this is where it gets really interesting. See, there's another form of technetium-99 called technetium-99-meter. The M stands for what? Metastable. Metastable. It means it's a slightly less stable form of technetium-99. Okay, so technetium-99-meter is like the hyperactive little brother of technetium-99. I like that analogy. And this little brother is actually the key to medical imaging. Really? It has a really short half-life, only six hours. Okay, that's a lot better than 200,000 years. Much better. Ha-ha. But why is that good for medical imaging? Well, as it decays back to technetium-99, it emits gamma rays. Gamma rays. I know those can be dangerous, but they're also used in, like, x-rays and stuff, right? Exactly. So in controlled doses, gamma rays can pass right through the body, and we can detect them using special cameras. And that lets doctors see what's going on inside without having to do surgery. Exactly. We can create images of organs, tissues, all sorts of things. So using the radioactivity of technetium-99 meters to see inside the body. Precisely. It's like a little radioactive flashlight. Wow. And since it has such a short half-life, the patient's exposure to radiation is pretty minimal, right? That's right. That's one of the big advantages of using technetium-99 meters. It decays quickly, so it doesn't stick around in the body for very long. Okay, that makes sense. But how do they even get technetium-99 meters into the patient in the first place? Do they, like, eject it directly? It's a little more complicated than that. They actually combine technetium-99 meters with special molecules that target certain organs or tissues. Oh, so it's like a guided missile. It goes exactly where it needs to in the body. Exactly. It's like attaching a GPS to the technetium-99 meters, telling it where to go. I love it. And then once the technetium-99 meter reaches its destination, the gamma rays it emits can be picked up by a camera. And that's what creates the image. So every year, millions of people are benefiting from this element. Right. That started out as nuclear waste. It's kind of amazing. Science can turn problems into solutions like that. I know. It's incredible. But it also sounds really complicated. Like, where do hospitals even get technetium-99 meter? Do they have to, like, extract it from nuclear waste? Well, it's mostly produced in a more controlled way. Using something called a technetium-99 meter generator. Generator. Like a little power plant for technetium. Not a power plant exactly, but it does produce technetium-99 meters on demand. Okay, how does that work? It uses molybdenum-99. Molybdenum-99. Which is another byproduct of nuclear fission. Oh, right. And molybdenum-99 decays into technetium-99 meter. So the generator basically harnesses that natural decay process to create a fresh supply of technetium-99 meter whenever it's needed. Ah, so they're not actually making technetium-99 meter. They're just, like, collecting it as the molybdenum-99 decays. Exactly. That's pretty clever. And you want to hear something
