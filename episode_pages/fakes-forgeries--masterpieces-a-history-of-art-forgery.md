## Transcript

Welcome to our deep dive into this whole world of art forgery. It's pretty fascinating and honestly kind of deceptive. And we've got some great material to work from today, excerpts from A History of Art Forgery and the Wikipedia page on art forgery. And we're going to try to unpack all the secrets and the scandals, all the crazy twists behind this practice that's been going on forever, right? So are you ready to kind of explore how a masterful fake can be basically indistinguishable from a legit masterpiece? Absolutely. And you know what's so interesting to me is that this desire to copy, to imitate, to even deceive with art, it's not new. This goes way back. We can trace this back to ancient Rome with sculptors making copies of those famous Greek statues. What's interesting is that back then, buyers probably knew they weren't buying originals. So it was more about just appreciating the skill, the craftsmanship, the stories behind the sculptures rather than, I guess, who actually made it. Exactly. Yeah. The artist's identity wasn't as crucial back then. Art served different purposes. Enjoyment, religious inspiration, storytelling. Right. It wasn't about the brand. You know, the artist is a brand. Yeah. That came later. So when did that shift happen? When did we start caring so much about the name behind the art? Well, you know, our history of art forgery source points to the Renaissance as a turning point. Okay. Yeah. It was a period of rediscovery of, you know, a surge in demand for art. Right. And with the unearthing of those Roman statues, right, it fueled a huge fascination with antiquities. Right. And suddenly the artist's signature was like synonymous with value. Like a form of currency even. Yeah. Yeah. And this is when we see, you know, artists like Michelangelo emerging. Right. Not just as a brilliant artist, but also someone who really understood the art market. Well, that's where that story of his forged sleeping Cupid comes in, right? He treated the sculpture with acidic earth to make it look super old. Yeah. And sold it as, you know, like an ancient Roman sculpture. Right. I was so surprised to read that he actually got to keep his share of the profits even after everybody found out it was a fake. It makes you wonder, you know, if that had like a lasting impact. Right. On the art market, you know. Yeah. Did it make buyers more cautious? Right. Or did it just kind of reinforce the fact that even, you know, the best artists are susceptible to making a quick buck? Yeah, for sure. It's interesting. It definitely adds another layer to how we view Michelangelo, right? Totally. As like a creative genius, but also like a savvy businessman. Yeah. But he wasn't the only one dealing with copycats back then, right? No, not at all. Our sources mentioned Albrecht DÃ¼rer too. Right. He was so frustrated with people copying his engravings that he even put like curses on his work. Yeah. You know, targeting anybody who would try to like pass them off as their own. You know, I can understand his frustration. Oh, yeah. Imagine putting all that creativity and skill into a piece. Only to see it copied and sold without your consent. Right. It raises questions about ownership. You know, attribution. What does originality even mean? Right, right. Yeah, it's interesting. And sometimes those copycats went beyond just like basic imitation. Oh, yeah, for sure. Like that story of Abraham Wolfgang Kufner. Kufner, yeah. He swapped a real DÃ¼rer self-portrait with a copy that he made. Wow. That is some audacity. That's bold. Yeah. His scheme unraveled eventually. Of course. The original turned up at an auction, but it just shows you the lengths people would go to for profit and maybe a little bit of notoriety. A little bit, yeah. It's like those art heist movies, you know, where the thief is in it for the thrill of the challenge as much as the loot. Yeah, totally. But let's shift gears a little bit. Let's talk about, you know, bigger operations. Okay. Our Wikipedia source mentions these forgery workshops in 19th century Mexico. Oh, yeah. Those were fascinating. Yeah. They would employ these skilled artisans who would just pump out these fake pre-Columbian artifacts. Oh. Catering to tourists. Yeah. You know. So they were basically creating a whole industry of fake antiquities. Yeah. It's kind of crazy how the definition of authenticity can be so fluid. Yeah. You know, influenced by what people want. Right. And how our perception of art changes over time. Well, like that Olukun bronze head from Ife in Africa. Right. At first people thought it was a fake. Yeah, because of how it was cast. Right. But then in 2010, modern analysis proved it was real. Yeah. It's a perfect example of how our understanding of art and technology is always evolving. Yeah. What we think is fake today could be real tomorrow. Right. It really makes you think about how we determine what's authentic. Yeah. The role of the experts and all this. It also makes me think about why people forge art in the first place. Is it always just about the money or are there other reasons? That's a great question. And it makes us kind of look deeper into, you know, like the psychology of the forger. Yeah. Some are obviously motivated by money. Right. But some have more complex motives. Maybe they want to expose what they see as like the hypocrisy of the art world. Right. Like they're trying to make a statement. Exactly. Like they say, look, you guys are all about the money and the status. Right. Not the art itself. Our sources actually mention some forgers who saw their work as like artistic rebellion. Oh, yeah. Like a way to challenge the system. Yeah. They wanted to prove that even the best experts could be fooled. Right. To show that taste and value are really subjective. It's kind of like they're saying, I'm so good at this that I can trick you all. Exactly. Han van Meegeren, he's a good example. Right. The Vermeer forger. Yeah. He was so good, he had to paint another fake in prison just to prove he was the one who'd done the first ones. Yeah. It's crazy. It's like a story out of a movie. It is. It almost romanticizes the idea of a forger. Like there's some kind of, you know, cunning mastermind. Right. But it also shows how much skill and knowledge they had. Oh, yeah. They had to understand not just the art, but also the history, the chemistry, the psychology of collectors. Absolutely. Their understanding of art history was incredible. Yeah. And their understanding of chemistry too. Yeah. And some of them would even create these elaborate fake provenances. What's that? Like fake documentation about the history of the artwork. To make it seem more legit. Exactly. Yeah. John Drew was famous for that. John Drew? Yeah. He was a British art dealer. He would forge documents, plant false evidence. Wow. So it's like they were creating art out of deception itself. Yeah. That's a good way to put it. And as we get into the modern era, this whole battle between forger and authenticator, it gets even more complicated, right? Technology changes everything. So with all this new tech, is it even possible to stay ahead of the forgers? Well, that's the million dollar question, isn't it? It leads us to the whole challenge of art authentication in the modern world. Right. Even with all the fancy tools, experts still disagree about the authenticity of some pieces. Right. Because how can you say for sure if something's real when even the pros don't agree? Exactly. And then you have the issue of restoration. Oh yeah, that's a big one. Sometimes a painting has been restored so many times that you can't even tell what's original anymore. You're right. Restoration can really complicate things. Yeah. It makes it hard to tell what's conservation and what's alteration. Like the Getty Kouros. What's that? It's this ancient Greek statue, and they're still debating if it's real or not. Oh, wow. They actually display it with a label that says Greek 530 BC or modern forgery. So they're just being honest about it. I guess so, yeah. Which is kind of refreshing, given how much money's at stake. Right. It just shows you how tricky this whole thing is. Yeah. But luckily, science is helping. Yeah. So... Well, you've got carbon dating, for one thing. Right, to figure out how old the materials are. Exactly. And we have x-ray analysis. We could look at the layers of a painting. Oh, wow. We can do pigment analysis to see what the colors are made of. And we even have digital image analysis now. Really? To find tiny inconsistencies. So it's like a CSI investigation. Exactly. So for art. Yeah. But in this case, the culprit might be long gone. Right. And the real victim is the truth. That's a great way to put it. Yeah. But even with all this tech, is there still a gray area? Oh, definitely. When it comes to what's a forgery, what's just a copy, what's a genuine fake, even. Right, there are definitely blurry lines. Like John Myatt. Oh, yeah. He used to be a forger, but now he openly sells his work as genuine fakes. I love that. He collaborates with buyers to make pieces in the style of famous artists. So he's turned his shady past into a legitimate art form. Pretty much, yeah. It really blurs the line between real and
