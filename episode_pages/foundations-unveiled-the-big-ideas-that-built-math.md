## Description

A guided tour through the foundations of mathematicsâ€”from ancient Greek geometry and irrational numbers to calculus, non-Euclidean geometry, and Russellâ€™s paradox. We'll explore big questionsâ€”Is math discovered or invented? What makes a proof rigorous? How do infinity and abstraction shape science and reality? With a historianâ€™s eye and a philosopherâ€™s curiosity, this podcast uncovers the ideas that keep math standing and why they matter today.

## Transcript

Ever catch yourself wondering what actually makes math tick? Yeah. And I don't mean like just solving for X, but like the real core ideas, the principles. Ambition. Yeah, the foundation that makes math, well, math. Right. And there's exactly what we're diving into today. The fascinating world of foundations of mathematics. Yeah, wild ride. It really is. And it's a journey that, you know, it's captivated mathematicians for centuries, right? Oh, yeah. From like the ancient Greeks trying to figure out what numbers are to like 20th century thinkers exploring the edge of what we can even know using math. Yeah, what's knowable in math. Yeah. Absolutely. So we're using Wikipedia as our guide for this deep dive. Excellent source. Very thorough. Oh, absolutely. And you'd be surprised the questions that mathematicians have been kind of like wrestling with for like ever. Oh, yeah. I mean like is math something that we just discover? Or is it something that we invent? Whoa. That's a big question. It's huge. It has huge implications for how we understand things like computer science. Yeah. Physics. Oh, wow. Like the nature of reality. The nature of reality. Yeah. So let's start way back. Let's go back to the ancient Greeks. Okay. They're really into logic and geometry. Geometry. And they built this whole system of mathematics that seemed, you know. It seemed pretty good. For centuries it seemed like rock solid. Rock solid. And at the heart of their system was this idea that all numbers could be shown as. As ratios, like fractions, right? Okay. So like give me an example. Like comparing the length of one line segment to another. Oh, okay. Yeah. So like I'm picturing like the classic like dividing a pie. Yeah, exactly. Into like even slices. Yeah, you got it. Okay. But then they discovered something that like threw a wrench in the whole thing. Oh. Irrational numbers. Okay. And irrational numbers, just a reminder, are. These are numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction no matter how hard you try. Okay, give me an example. Like the square root of two. Okay. Very famous example. It's the length of the diagonal of a square with sides of length one. Okay. And you try to write that as a fraction, you're going to be there for a while. You're going to be there forever. Yeah, exactly. So what did the Greeks do? Yeah. I mean, did they just like throw in the towel? Were they like, all right, math is broken, we're done? No, no, they were much too clever for that. Okay. So a mathematician named Eudoxus. Eudoxus. Yeah, he came up with this really clever workaround, a way to compare these irrational ratios without actually having to like define them as specific fractions. It was a big deal. That's huge. Yeah. So they found a way to be like, okay, we can't define it, but we can still work with it. Exactly. Okay. Keep moving forward. Okay. And it seems like that's a theme here, right? Like mathematicians, they hit a wall. Yeah. And they're like, all right, new concept. Exactly. New concept, new tool. Let's do it. And that kind of reminds me of like when Newton and Leibniz came up with calculus. Yeah. Calculus is all about motion and change. Absolutely, yeah. Powerful. But it introduced this concept. Of infinitesimals. Infinitesimals. Yeah. Okay. For those of us who, you know, maybe haven't heard that term in a while, what are those again? Okay, so imagine something that is smaller than any number you can think of. Okay. But it's not zero. Okay. My brain is already hurting a little bit. Yeah, yeah. They're very small. They're very, very tiny. So it's like this idea. Yeah. That's so small it almost doesn't exist, but it has to exist for math to work. Yes, exactly. That's a great way to put it. And, you know, they're really useful for things like, you know, figuring out instantaneous velocity. Yeah. But they caused quite a stir in the math world. Really? Yeah, some mathematicians like George Berkeley, they weren't convinced that these infinitely small quantities were even logically possible. So calculus worked. Yeah. But nobody really knew why. That's right. I bet that was frustrating for some people. It fueled some very intense debates about the foundations of mathematics. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. But ultimately, you know, these debates, they pushed mathematicians to think more rigorously about numbers and limits to move beyond just these like geometric ways of looking at things. So it's like it worked, but we need to like figure out why it works. Yeah, exactly. Okay. We can't just be happy with it working. Gotcha. Yeah. So that brings us up to the 19th century, which from what I've heard, it's a wild time. It was a wild time for math, yeah. For mathematics. Yeah, the 19th century. They were really wrestling with these foundational issues on multiple fronts, right? And for one thing, they started exploring geometries where Euclid's postulates, the ideas of, you know, parallel lines never meet, all that stuff. They started playing around with geometries where those things weren't necessarily true. Wait, hold on. So you're telling me there are geometries where parallel lines do meet? That's right. Yeah, it's pretty wild. How is that even possible? It's a total mind bender, but it's true. And they're called non-Euclidean geometries. Okay. And these geometries really challenged the idea that there's just one true geometry. Right. Like math could describe multiple equally valid realities. It really makes you question, like, what does it even mean for something to be true in math, right? Right. And if questioning the very nature of geometry wasn't enough, mathematicians also started digging deeper into, like, the building blocks of math, the things we kind of take for granted, like, you know, the natural numbers. Like 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3 and so on. Yeah, just like counting. I have to admit, like, I never really thought about there being different ways to, like, define numbers. Like, isn't it just kind of self-evident? You would think so, but it gets really tricky when you try to define even the simplest mathematical concept really, really rigorously. Okay. Like, what does it even mean for something to be a natural number? Right. And in trying to formalize these basic concepts, mathematicians started grappling with these even more abstract ideas. Okay. Like, what is infinity? Yeah, that's a good word. This is a concept that's puzzled thinkers for, like, millennia. Right, forever. Yeah. Okay. So math went from questioning geometry to questioning numbers themselves. It's like an existential crisis. It really was. And just when they thought things couldn't get any weirder, along comes Bertrand Russell with a paradox that just, like, shook the foundations of mathematics. All right, hit me with it. What was Russell's paradox? Okay, so imagine a set. Okay, I'm imagining a set. That contains all sets that don't contain themselves. Okay. The million dollar question is, does this set contain itself? Okay, so if it does contain itself, then it shouldn't. Right. Because it's only supposed to have sets that don't contain themselves. Yeah, yeah. But if it doesn't contain itself, then it should be. You got it. Because it fits the criteria. Exactly. It's like a logical loop. It's a total contradiction. It's a mind bender. Like, how do you even? Yeah, and it revealed this flaw in set theory. Oh, wow. Which at the time was like the most promising foundation for all of mathematics. Oh, really? Yeah, it was a big deal. So what happened? Like, did that just blow everything wide open? It caused a major upheaval. Okay. Mathematicians realized they couldn't just, like, sweep this paradox under the rug. Right. They had to address these really foundational issues. Right. And that's what they did. Okay. And from this period of crisis, different schools of thought kind of emerged, right? Okay. Each with their own, like, way of dealing with these really profound questions about, like, what is mathematical truth? So it's like different schools of mathematics now, each with their own perspective. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so, like, give me an example. What's one of these schools of thought? So one school of thought that emerged was formalism. Formalism. Yeah. And formalists, they believe that math is essentially a game. Oh, okay. Right, a game with symbols and rules and axioms. So it's like, it doesn't matter if, like, trying to think of an example, like chess. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It doesn't really matter if the pieces represent, like, a real army. Exactly, exactly. As long as you follow the rules of chess. Yeah. You can play the game. The game makes sense, yeah. Okay. And so the formalists are like, you know, the meaning or the truth of the mathematical statement, that's not really the important thing. Okay. What's important is, is it consistent within the system? Oh, interesting. As long as you don't run into contradictions, you're good to go. Okay, so it's more about the, like, internal consistency of the system than, like, if it reflects something, like, real necessarily. Right, and then you have, on the other side, you have the intuitionists. The intuitionists. Yeah,
