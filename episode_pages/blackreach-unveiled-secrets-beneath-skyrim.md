## Transcript

Ever feel like, you know, the best stories, they're hidden, like right below the surface? Yeah. That's Blackreach. We're talking a whole other world tucked away under Skyrim. The whole hidden world. I like it. And you listeners, you sent me a ton of stuff, maps, old journals, even some historical records all about Blackreach. Can't wait to dig into it. Oh, you're in for a treat with this one. Yeah. Blackreach, it really gets the imagination going, you know, for us Elder Scrolls fans. Like, what if? What if there's more to this world? Like, way more than we see? Exactly. And it's not just what's down there, right? It's how it all connects. Like, how does Blackreach change what we know about Skyrim, about its history? Good point. Okay, so picture this. You're trekking across Skyrim, freezing your butt off, right? Yeah, I know the feeling. And bam, you find it. An entrance to this massive cavern. And we're talking huge-y. Oh yeah, Blackreach is massive. Blowing mushrooms bigger than houses, Dwemer ruins, ancient tech humming away. It's another world down there. It is. And it makes you think, right? You've got Skyrim, all snowy mountains, frozen wastelands. But then Blackreach. It's teeming with life. Not always the friendliest life, mind you. Makes you wonder what else is hidden below. Not just in Skyrim, but everywhere. Hidden. Exactly. Which brings us to the big question, who built this place? The architects of this underground world, the Dwemer. Ah, the Dwemer. Talk about a mystery. Even for Elder Scrolls, these guys are a puzzle. Master engineers vanished overnight. But they left clues behind. In Blackreach, especially. Like those great lifts, how did they even... The great lifts are incredible feats of engineering. Massive stretchers connecting Blackreach to Dwemer cities all over. Talk about ambition. They were moving mountains, literally, to create this network beneath our feet. It's mind-boggling. And it wasn't just like building stuff. They were dabbling in some serious magic. Aetherium. Powerful, dangerous, volatile. And guess what? It played a big part in their downfall. It's like a Greek tragedy or something. Their own ambition, their thirst for knowledge, it destroyed them. Yeah, the Aetherium Wars. A whole civilization almost torn apart fighting over this one substance. A cautionary tale, right? Don't mess with forces you don't understand. Right. And here's the thing. Blackreach, the place they once ruled, might still hold the key to understanding their downfall. How so? There are accounts, stories about huge Aetherium deposits in Blackreach. Imagine that. The very thing that destroyed them, still there, waiting. It's like poetic justice or something. But the Dwemers, they weren't the only ones who felt the impact of what happened in Blackreach. We can't forget the Falmer. The tragic story of how the Dwemers' ambition, well, it had a very dark side. It's a tough story. The Falmer, they weren't always, you know, like this. They were the Snow Elves, a proud people, driven underground by the Nords. Desperate, they turned to the Dwemer for help. And the Dwemer, well, let's just say they saw an opportunity. Not exactly a helping hand situation. More like taking advantage. Exactly. The Snow Elves became their workforce. Yeah. And then experiments, horrible experiments. Yeah, I read about this. Didn't end well. Not at all. Forced into this underground life, toxic food, it all messed them up. Their eyesight, their bodies, everything. They changed, became the Falmer we know now. Just tragic. It's like a reminder, even in this magical world, even with advanced tech, there's still darkness. Oh, absolutely. And the irony, like it's their home now. The Falmer, I mean. The ruins of their enslavers. It's a lot to process. History can be cruel like that. No kidding. But hey, speaking of things hidden in Blackreach, what about this dark heart, this artifact? It's like whispers and legends. What's the deal with that? Ah, the dark heart. Now there's a source of trouble if ever there was one. Imagine a magnet drawing in anyone with a bit too much ambition. Power hungry types. Throughout history, drawn to Blackreach. All because of this artifact. Why? What made it so special? Good question. We're talking ancient power here. The Night Hollow Vampire Clan, they were some of the first to settle in Blackreach. They believe the dark heart, it sustained them. Replaced their need for blood. Wow, hold on. Instead of feeding, it was this artifact. That's next level. It speaks to the power, doesn't it? But also a darkness. A corrupting influence. Yeah, I was going to say, nothing good comes easy. Not with power like that. Exactly. And the Dwemer. Tech wizards, right? But even they couldn't resist the dark heart. They stole it from the Night Hollow. Built that whole library of Ark Sand, the orrery too. They built an entire observatory underground just to study this thing. Dedication. Obsessed is more like it. They wanted to understand it. Its connection to the void. Raw magic, dangerous and unpredictable. I get the feeling that didn't end well. Messing with forces beyond your understanding. You're right to be cautious. There's a price for knowledge sometimes. Tampering with the unknown, it always comes back to bite you. So what are we talking here? What could this dark heart actually do? Well, legend says disturbing it could unleash harrowstorms. Okay, and harrowstorms are? Devastating. Magical storms capable of reshaping the land itself. Like literally rearranging mountains. Whoa, okay, that's bad. This tiny artifact could cause that much chaos? The potential is there. Which leads to another question, right? What about Blackreach itself? Yeah, good point. After the Grimmer vanished, what happened to the place? Did it just fade into legend? Not quite. See, even though a lot of Blackreach's history is still a mystery, we do have some stories. Accounts from later eras. Oh, like what? Well, there's this Dominion Scout, Vol. During the Alliance War, he fell down a shaft. Ended up in Blackreach. Wrong place, wrong time, right? You could say that again. Did he ever get out? Oh, he did. His journals, they're a wild read. A glimpse into Blackreach during the Second Era. Apparently, he even managed to repair a great lift to escape. Talk about a quick study. So Blackreach was still active, even centuries after the Dwemers were gone. Had to be others drawn to a place like that. You'd be surprised who and what finds its way to Blackreach. The Ice Reach Coven, for example. Who? Powerful necromancers. They used Blackreach as their base for a while. The isolation, the magic, it appealed to them. Of course it did. Can't forget about them. Anything for more power. Exactly. And as word, or rumors at least, about Blackreach spread, it attracted even more attention. More opportunists. Like the Bitterblade Mining Consortium. They established Dust Town, a whole settlement inside Blackreach. All about those resources, huh? Sounds like a common theme. It's always about resources, isn't it? Right. But I guess that's Blackreach in a nutshell, right? Power, knowledge, refuge. But always a risk. You get the wonder, but there's always a danger lurking. You know, with all this talk about necromancers and mining consortiums, it's easy to forget we're talking about a closet with a dragon in it. A dragon in Blackreach. Easy to forget. I think about it all the time. Valthuriel is no ordinary dragon. Even for their kind, we're talking immense power. Yeah, the sources mention that. But why? Why would a dragon be down there, in Blackreach of all places? There are theories, of course. Some say it was drawn to the magic. Like, Blackreach is this nexus of energy, right? Maybe Valthuriel wants to hoard it all for itself, like a giant, scaly, magic-obsessed... A magic hoarder instead of golden jewels. Now, that's an image. Right. But there's another theory, too. More unsettling. Some think Valthuriel is bound to Blackreach. A prisoner or a warden guarding something. A warden. Okay, now that is way more terrifying. A being that powerful stuck down there? What could be so important that it needs a dragon as a guard? Exactly. That's the question, isn't it? Whatever it is, it has to be big. Big enough to, you know, warrant a dragon. That's an understatement if I've ever heard one. And from what I read, facing this Valthuriel, it's no walk in the park. Oh, no. We're talking ancient rituals, mastering the voice. You'd need some serious guts, too. Not just anyone can waltz in there and say hello. More like shout hello loud enough for a dragon to hear. Something like that. But for those who could pull it off, think of the knowledge, the power. Okay, I'm sensing a theme here. Blackreach is endlessly fascinating, but it comes at a price. Wonder and danger all rolled into one. Exactly. Blackreach, it's like a tiny little, well, maybe not so tiny, reflection of the Elder Scrolls world itself. History, myth, reality, they all blend together down there. And mysteries more than we can count. Makes you think, doesn't
