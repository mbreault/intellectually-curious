Learn about OEIS A000267 Integer Part of Square Root

## Transcript

Welcome, curious minds, to another deep dive. Today, we're embarking on a really fascinating journey into the heart of the online encyclopedia integer sequences, the OEIS. We're picking one sequence that, well, at first glance seems utterly straightforward, yet as we peel back its layers, it reveals this astonishing web of mathematical connections. Our mission today? To explore OEIS A000267. The sequence is simply defined as the integer part of the square root of 4n plus 1. So for this deep dive, we're not just looking at its definition, we're examining its surprising behavior, its various alternative identities, and how it pops up in mathematical contexts you might never expect. It's a brilliant example of how a single string of numbers can offer multiple perspectives and, well, unlock unexpected insights across different mathematical domains. And to guide us through this numerical landscape, we have with us our brilliant expert ready to illuminate the hidden beauty within these numbers. It's a real pleasure to be here. This sequence, A000267, it's genuinely a prime example of how even what appears to be a very simple definition in number theory can lead to profoundly rich insights and connections that span across various mathematical disciplines. It powerfully illustrates how integer sequences aren't just lists of numbers, but incredibly precise lenses through which you can understand intricate mathematical structures. Fantastic. Let's jump right in then. When you apply the formula for floor squared 4n plus 1 for n starting at 0, 1, 2, and so on, the terms of the sequence begin. 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7. Now for anyone perhaps new to this notation, the floor function simply means you calculate the value inside the parentheses and then you round down to the nearest whole number. So if squared 4n plus 1 worked out to say 3.7, the floor of that would just be 3. Looking at these initial terms, what's the very first thing that jumps out to you? Well, what's immediately captivating as you just read the terms is that distinct pattern of repetition. You see 3 appearing twice, then 4 twice, followed by 5 appearing three times, then 6 three times, and so on. This isn't just a quirky anomaly, it's a very precise, predictable pattern. Bernard Schott, a contributor to the OEIS page for A000267, he formalizes this. He states that every number k is present consecutively floor 2k plus 3, 4 times. This characteristic alone is a powerful hint that there's a much deeper structure here than just a straightforward square root calculation. The repetition acts almost like a mathematical fingerprint, giving us a clue to the sequence's underlying design. That formula for the repetition is already pretty fascinating. But let's go back to the core definition, floor 4n plus 1. What makes that specific expression 4n plus 1 so foundational or, I guess, special in this context? It doesn't seem immediately obvious why that form as opposed to, say, 2n plus 1 or n plus 1 would be the one. That's a crucial question. The expression 4n plus 1 is highly significant because it's intimately related to the structure of odd perfect squares. You see, any odd perfect square can always be written in the form 2k plus 1, 2. If you expand that, you get 4k2 plus 4k plus 1. Okay. Now, if we let n equals k2 plus k, then 4n plus 1 becomes 4k2 plus k plus 1, which is, well, 4k2 plus 4k plus 1. That's precisely 2k plus 1, 2. Wow, I see it, correct. So the square root of 4n plus 1 will be an integer exactly when 4n plus 1 itself is an odd perfect square. The floor function then extracts the integer part, essentially telling us which odd number squared 4n plus 1 is closest to or equal to. It's a very deliberate choice that aligns the sequence with the natural progression of odd numbers being squared. Okay, here's where it truly becomes intriguing, I think. One of the most captivating aspects of number theory and indeed the OEIS is how a single sequence can be described by multiple seemingly unrelated formulas. For A000267, we have several. For example, Robert A. Stump proposes floor 1 plus 1. My first thought is, how in the world does that expression, you know, with a fraction and square roots in the denominator, how does that possibly produce the same numbers as floor square n plus 1? It looks like it belongs to an entirely different mathematical universe. It's a fantastic observation, and it really highlights the hidden elegance of algebraic manipulation. When we encounter an expression like 1 square n plus 1 square n, a common technique is to rationalize the denominator. Right, I remember that term. Yeah, so for those unfamiliar, this just means we eliminate the square roots from the bottom of the fraction. We do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by something called its conjugate. The conjugate of square n plus 1 is simply square n plus 1 plus square n. Now when you multiply square n plus 1 square n by square n plus 1 plus square n, it uses that difference of squares identity, ab, a plus b equals a to b2. So the denominator becomes n plus 1 n, which, well, it elegantly simplifies to just 1. Which means the entire expression 1 square n plus 1 square n just simplifies to square n plus 1 plus square n. That's neat. So Stump's formula is actually equivalent to floor square n plus 1. And this connects beautifully to Bruno Burselli's later formula floor square n plus square n plus 2, showing how different algebraic forms can reveal the same underlying sequence. It's like finding different maps that lead you to the exact same treasure chest, you know? That's a genuinely remarkable simplification. It really is like peeling back layers of an onion to find the core. But then we have David W. Wilson's description, which states an floor nk n z plus ap. Now, this represents the number of distinct values of floor for positive integers k. That feels like it's from a completely different branch of mathematics, like counting discrete objects rather than calculating square roots. What does this connection tell us? Indeed, that's a profound shift in perspective. Wilson's formula plunges us straight into the world of combinatorics and number theory, specifically dealing with integer division and divisor functions. Instead of direct calculation, this approach is about counting the unique results you get when you divide n by every positive integer k up to n and then take the floor of each quotient. Right. This tells us that A000267 isn't just about smooth functions like square roots. It also emerges naturally from these discrete counting problems. It implies a deeper connection to how numbers break down through division and how those quotients distribute themselves. And another fascinating alternative comes from Michael Somos, who offers a recursive formula, an obel 1 plus an floor n 12 for n 0 0. Recursive. So it depends on earlier terms. Exactly. This kind of self-referential definition where a term depends on previous terms is often a sign of incredibly rich internal structure. It reveals how the sequence can be built step by step. While perhaps not as computationally efficient for finding individual terms as the original floor squared form plus one for, you know, most computers today, it offers a powerful conceptual pathway to understanding the sequence's growth. It's incredible how many different lenses we can use to view this single sequence. And it's not just alternative formulas, right? We also see this sequence emerging from different mathematical structures altogether. Philippe Delahame noted that A000267 can be found by reading the diagonals of triangle A094727. For those of us who haven't spent much time staring at triangular arrays of numbers, could you maybe paint a picture for us of what that means? Absolutely. Imagine triangle A094727 laid out like this. The first row just has one. The second row has two, three. The third row has three, four, five. The fourth row has four, five, six, seven, and so on. Each row starts with the next integer and then lists consecutive integers up to a certain point. Now, to read it by diagonals, you start at the very top left, which is the one. Then for the next diagonal, you pick up the first element of the second row, which is two. Right, just the two. Then for the next diagonal, you're gathering elements from the slant. You take the second element of the second row, which is three, and the first element of the third row, which is also three. Ah, okay, so you get three, three. Exactly. Then moving to the next diagonal, you collect the third element of the third row, which is four, and the second element of the fourth row, which is also four. Okay, four. I see it now. So it would be one, then two, then three, three, then four, four, then five, five. This perfectly matches that surprising repetition pattern we saw right at the beginning. Precisely. That's brilliant. So the visual geometric structure of that triangle literally generates the exact repetition we saw in the sequence itself. That's the idea. This kind of visual or array-based interpretation really helps to solidify the numerical relationships. And it demonstrates how sequences can be deeply embedded within larger, often beautiful mathematical constructs. It's a testament to the elegant patterns that arise when numbers are arranged in specific ways, almost like a natural blueprint for their structure. It makes you wonder how many other sequences are hiding in plain sight within these elegant geometric arrangements, doesn't it? Oh,
